This winter, Sunshine Coast Council is [upgrading](file:///C:/Users/kf015/Downloads/Project%2520News%252003220621Div%25202B3756Lock%2520Maintenance%2520Columba%2520Place%2520Pelican%2520Waters.pdf)
&#x20;the Pelican Waters Lock that allows boats to travel between Pelican Waters Northern Lake and Lamerough Canal, and works to control stable water levels.

The Sunshine Coast is synonymous with life on the water and our region offers hundreds of kilometres of glistening navigable waterways to enjoy fishing and boating.

Caring for our waterways is a high priority for council. Regular maintenance supports healthy ecosystems and enables residents to safely enjoy water recreation.    

This essential Pelican Waters Lock maintenance includes:

*   cleaning of sludge and marine growth off the surface of the lock
*   reconditioning the lock gates, which will be transferred to an offsite facility to be stripped, repaired, recoated and rubber seals replaced
*   servicing of all actuators and gearboxes, anode replacement and other maintenance to ensure the lock continues to smoothly service our community.As an added bonus for lock users, a wireless access system will be installed allowing them to open the lock gates remotely.

During construction, the lock and parts of the surrounding canal-side area will be closed.

Works have now begun and are expected to be complete by mid-September 2022, just in time for the school holidays and warmer boating months.

Council thanks the community for their patience and understanding as this much-needed community facility is upgraded.

The convenient new frequency operated button (FOB) can be purchased from our [Customer Contact Centres](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council/Office-Locations)
&#x20;from September 12, 2022 or you can still use your traditional access card.
