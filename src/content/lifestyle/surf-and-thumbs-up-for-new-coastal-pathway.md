Have you been for a walk along Warana's new section of coastal pathway yet?

The new, wide concrete pathway was reconstructed and stretches from Beach Access 236 and 235, between Minkara Street and Langura Street.

Walkers and cyclists have been taking advantage of coastal views along the Stage 1 section of the Warana Coastal Pathway which opened this month.

Stage 2 works are currently underway and are expected to be completed by late-April, pending material supply and weather conditions.

For more information about construction stages and timeframes, please visit Council’s website and search ‘[Warana Coastal Pathway](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Coastal-Pathway)
’.

The pathway is being completed in partnership with Council and the Department of Transport and Main Road’s Cycle Network Local Government Grants Program.
