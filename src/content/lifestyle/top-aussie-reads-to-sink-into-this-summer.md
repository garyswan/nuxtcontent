**Seven must-reads for summer:**

1.  [Love & Virtue](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=849079)


    by Diana Reid\
    The plot follows Michaela and Eve, two bright, bold women who befriend each other their first year at a residential college at university, where they live in adjacent rooms. They could not be more different; one assured and popular – the other uncertain and eager-to-please. But something happens one night in O-week – a drunken encounter, a foggy memory that will force them to confront the realities of consent and wrestle with the dynamics of power.

2.  [The Mother Wound](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=827972)


    by Amani Haydar\
    Amani Haydar is an artist, lawyer, mum and advocate for women's health and safety based in Western Sydney. Writing with grace and beauty, Amani has drawn from her story of female resilience and the role of motherhood in the home and in the world. In *The Mother Wound*, she uses her own strength to help other survivors find their voices.

3.  [Black and Blue: A memoir of racism and resilience](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=817112)


    by Veronica Gorrie\
    A proud Kurnai woman, Veronica Gorrie grew up dauntless, full of cheek and a fierce sense of justice. After watching her friends and family suffer under a deeply compromised law-enforcement system, Gorrie signed up for training to become one of a rare few Aboriginal police officers in Australia. With a great gift for storytelling and a wicked sense of humour, Gorrie frankly and movingly explores the impact of racism on her family and her life, the impact of intergenerational trauma resulting from cultural dispossession, and the inevitable difficulties of making her way as an Aboriginal woman in the white-and-male-dominated workplace of the police force.

4.  [Badness](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=874101)


    by Gary Jubelin\
    Former top detective-turned award-winning author and host of the top-rating *podcast I Catch Killers*, also the title of his bestselling memoir. *Badness*, which puts under the microscope the evil he faced on a daily basis during his career as one of Australia’s most respected and decorated police homicide detectives. Gary led investigations into the disappearance of William Tyrrell; the serial killing of three Aboriginal children in Bowraville; and the brutal gangland murder of Terry Falconer.

5.  [The Couple Upstairs](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=879783)


    by Holly Wainwright\
    Five months after Mel told her husband to leave, a ghost moved in upstairs. A young man who reminds her, with eerie intensity, of a past lover, someone who changed Mel's life and then vanished. *The Couple Upstairs* is about one strange summer of dazzling, curdling infatuation. Writing with both a light touch and vivid intensity, Holly Wainwright explores love, regret, whether you can stop history repeating, and whether or not you should.

6.  [Day’s End](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=879451)


    by Garry Disher\
    Daybreak to day's end, dirt roads and dust. Every problem that besets small towns and isolated properties, from unlicensed driving to arson. In the time of the virus, Hirsch is seeing stresses heightened and social divisions cracking wide open. His own tolerance under strain; people getting close to the edge. Garry Disher has published over fifty titles across multiple genres. With a growing reputation for his best-selling crime novels, he has won multiple international and Australian writers awards.

7.  [The Soulmate](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=881458)


    by Sally Hepsworth\
    Before the woman went over the cliff, Pippa and Gabe were happy. They have the kind of marriage that everyone envies, as well as two sweet young daughters, a supportive family, and a picturesque cliff-side home - which would have been idyllic had the tall beachside cliffs not become so popular among those wishing to end their lives. Sally Hepworth is the *New York Times* bestselling author of seven novels, drawing on the good, the bad and the downright odd of human behaviour, she writes incisively about family, relationships and identity.
