Welcome to True North, Maroochydore. In this video, Dan Sparks from Sparks Architects, and Rob McCready from Altum discuss this effective use of beach house aesthetics in an environmentally sustainable apartment building.

By taking every opportunity to incorporate landscape with trees, plantings and ground cover plus climbing vines the architects have connected the place to its surrounding local environment. Making it blend and look very natural in Maroochydore.
