The Sunshine Coast’s pristine natural environment and vibrant villages offer endless opportunities to get out and explore.

Our region features 1293 parks, 356 playgrounds, 39 dedicated off-leash dog areas, and 16 dog exercise parks with something for all ages and abilities to enjoy.

From the sparkling new Northern Parkland on Mooloolaba’s famed foreshore to hidden hinterland gems like Turner Park in Beerwah, we invite you to grab your family, friends, and fur-babies for a fun day out.

Here are nine picture-perfect parks and playgrounds that received a special upgrade this year:

**Ship Ahoy Pirate Maties!**

*Kevin Asmus Park - 20 Nanyima Street, Buddina*

Bright, bold and nautical in theme, kids will love playing pirate for the day at the upgraded [Kevin Asmus Park](https://oursc.com.au/featured/sail-the-seven-seas-at-kevin-asmus-park)
, Buddina. A new slide, ship bow, climbing ropes, swing set and shade sails are among the new highlights for little scallywags, with plenty of hidey-holes for exploration and imaginary play at ‘treasure island’. Be sure to pack the scooters and snacks as there’s plenty of pathways to discover, and shaded picnic tables to enjoy your grub.

**Quiet Coastal Hideout**

*Cordellia Street Park - 10 Cordellia Street, Coolum Beach*

&#x20;is back - bigger and better than before. The funky new multi-play set will have little ones sliding, climbing, rocking, and swinging out the sillies with loads of lovely, grassed areas to safely run free.
