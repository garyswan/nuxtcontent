If yoga is a bit of a stretch for you, now’s the time to take part in council’s flagship community health and wellbeing program.

Registrations are now open for Sunshine Coast residents to hop, skip and jump into a variety of activities on offer when Healthy Sunshine Coast kicks off shortly this Spring season.  

Registration is free, but essential. Once signed up, local residents will be notified directly when a range of low-cost activities around the region become available.

Now in its sixth year, Healthy Sunshine Coast is an affordable and holistic health and wellbeing program focusing on moving well, eating well, sleeping well, thinking well and connecting well with others.

It is all about creating a happier, healthier, more connected and resilient Sunshine Coast community.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the line-up of low-cost activities had something for everyone.

“Classes are entry-level, low to medium impact fitness and wellbeing activities and designed for all ages and abilities,” Cr Law said.

“Local community groups, individuals and businesses have submitted their interest to run a number of health and wellbeing activities including yoga, tai chi, aqua and group fitness sessions.

“[Register your interest](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast/Register-Now)
&#x20;now to join Healthy Sunshine Coast! It is a great opportunity to try something new, be healthy and active.”

The program aims to encourage:

*   positive mental health and resilience
*   regular physical activity
*   healthy eating
*   strong social connections
*   participation across all ages and abilities.

Once people have completed this one-off registration, they will be able to join in the range of low-cost activities on offer once finalised.

You will receive email updates on when classes begin, and information on how to book. Please note, if you have registered in the past, you will need to re-register.

Activities will be added over time, so ensure you are registered to be kept up-to-date.
