Sunshine Coast Council Libraries invite you to enjoy an evening with celebrated Australian author and journalist Trent Dalton at The Events Centre, Caloundra from 6pm on Thursday, November 11.

This special literary event is part of a Sunshine Coast Libraries author series hosted at locations across the region.

Trent will talk about his latest release *Love Stories,* inspired by a personal moment of profound love and generosity.

He spent 2021 speaking to people from all walks of life, asking them one simple and direct question: ‘Can you please tell me a love story?’

The result is an immensely warm, poignant, funny and moving book about love in all its guises, including observations, reflections and stories of people falling into love, falling out of love, and never letting go of the loved ones in their hearts.

A heartfelt, deep, wise and tingly tribute to the greatest thing we will never understand and the only thing we will ever really need: love.

Trent Dalton is one of Australia’s best-loved and bestselling emerging authors, whose books have sold over 780,000 copies in Australia alone.

Trent writes for *The Weekend Australian Magazine.* He’s a two-time winner of a Walkley Award for Excellence in Journalism. And, his number one bestselling debut novel *Boy Swallows Universe* broke records to become the fastest selling Australian debut novel ever.

The theatrical adaptation of *Boy Swallows Universe* will premiere with Queensland Theatre Company in late 2021 and the novel is also being adapted for the screen, with Joel Edgerton attached.

Dalton’s second novel, *All Our Shimmering Skies*, was published in September 2020 and became an instant number-one bestseller on release.

Trent’s book will be available for purchase at the venue with a book signing session.

Trent will be joined by special guest former ABC radio announcer and author, Mary-Lou Stephens.

Tickets are $20 per person and bookings are essential via council’s library website: [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Trent-Dalton)
&#x20;or in person at The Events Centre, Caloundra.

Doors open at 6pm, The Events Centre café and bar will be available to purchase light refreshments. Enjoy live music with Nyssa Ray. The show will begin at 7pm.

The Events Centre, Caloundra is located at 20 Minchinton Street, Caloundra.
