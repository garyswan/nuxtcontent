Want to learn how to maximise your quality of life with energy and vitality, plus maintain physical, mental and emotional health as you age?

Then come along for a day of learning at the Healthy Ageing Forum 2022, Rethinking Ageing – Moving and Grooving into Healthy Ageing

Held on Saturday, November 26, at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the forum will empower you to live a vibrant and balanced life as you age.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said while people may be living longer, they were not necessarily living with a good quality of life.  

“The Healthy Ageing Forum 2022 will give participants the opportunity to learn and engage with experts from UniSC, Sunshine Coast University Hospital and other health practitioners who will showcase the latest research on healthy ageing,” Cr Law said.

“You will have the opportunity to chat with stallholders from local organisations and can join in the fun at ‘Move and Groove it’ and yoga sessions.

“Be entertained by MC Lynda Prout, morning presenter at the Sunshine Coast’s radio station, Sunshine FM 104.9.

“Buy your [ticket online](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Older-people)

*This event is presented in partnership by Sunshine Coast Council and UniSC, and supported with funding from Wellways Carer Gateway, and the Central Queensland, Wide Bay, Sunshine Coast PHN through the Australian Government’s PHN Program.*
