Local beachgoers and visitors to the Sunshine Coast are being urged to swim between the flags and heed lifeguards’ instructions to stay safe across our region’s beaches over the Christmas and New Year holiday period.

It comes as lifeguards and volunteer lifesavers prepare for bumper crowds at Sunshine Coast beaches.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council’s $5.7 million investment in lifeguard services this financial year meant the region was well prepared to help keep local residents and visitors safe across the Sunshine Coast.

“Last January more than 1.2 million people visited our Sunshine Coast beaches, and there’s no doubt that record will be smashed in 2022,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our beaches are some of the most desired in the country and, indeed, the world, which reinforces why it is crucial we support the invaluable services provided by our highly skilled lifeguards so that everyone can enjoy a safe experience at the beach.

“We warmly welcome visitors to our region, and encourage everyone to support our hardworking lifeguards and volunteer lifesavers by always swimming between the red and yellow flags and following important warnings and instructions.

“Stop and think. We want to avoid any tragedies at our beaches this Christmas period.”  

Surf Life Saving Queensland Sunshine Coast Regional Operations Manager Aaron Purchase said their biggest message this Christmas was “she’ll be right won’t save your life.”

“If people have had a few alcoholic drinks do not, under any circumstances, enter the water, and never swim at night,” Mr Purchase said.

“Unfortunately, some Aussies are a bit complacent in and around the water, especially when it comes to safety at the beach or thinking they won’t get caught in a rip.

“Ninety per cent of drowning deaths last year were male and the average age of people rescued last year was 24.”

More than 20 locations across the Sunshine Coast are patrolled throughout the season.

**Remember to:**

*   Always swim between the red and yellow flags;
