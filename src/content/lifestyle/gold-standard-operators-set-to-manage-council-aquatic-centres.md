Two experienced operators have successfully tendered for the leases and management of the Caloundra and Cotton Tree Aquatic Centres.

Tenders for the leasing and management of both council-owned facilities closed on April 26 this year and attracted a number of high-quality applications.

City Venue Management will take over as the new lessee of the Caloundra Aquatic Centre from July 1, 2022.

Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre will continue to be run by existing lessees Swim Fit Sunshine Coast, which has managed the facility since 1995.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said City Venue Management was suitably qualified to manage the highly popular Caloundra Aquatic Centre.

“The [Caloundra](http://www.caloundra-aquatic.com.au/)
&#x20;Aquatic Centre is a hugely popular council-owned facility which offers a wide range of activities, from learn-to-swim classes and aqua aerobics right through to experienced squad level swimming,” Cr Landsberg said.

“City Venue Management is the current lessee of the Kawana Aquatic Centre and council is very confident it will do a fantastic job managing the Caloundra Aquatic Centre, following the retirement of John Wallace, who was the lessee at the facility for the past 37 years.”

City Venue Management Managing Director Jay Clarke said it was not often you had the opportunity to build on foundations created by industry legends.

“We are thrilled to receive the baton of managing the Caloundra Aquatic Centre and would look to build on the strong foundations created by John, Vicki and all their staff,” Mr Clarke said. 

“The Caloundra Aquatic Centre has been a fantastic local community asset for many years and our goal is to ensure it remains a quality facility which is accessible for all members of the community.

“City Venue Management operates 27 venues across South East Queensland and is pleased to have secured our second venue on the Sunshine Coast, expanding our well-known Rackley Swimming Learn to Swim and Squad programs, Aquatic and Group Fitness offerings, City Health Club Training Zone and Pool Deck Café.

“We are particularly looking forward to building on our strong relationship with the Sunshine Coast Council, as well as local clubs and community groups as we work to provide ongoing aquatic education, aiding safer and more enjoyable swimming opportunities.”

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said Swim Fit had delivered nearly three decades of outstanding management at the Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre.

“Swim Fit has done an outstanding job managing the Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre over the past 27 years,” Cr Natoli said.

“Last year Swim Fit was awarded Royal Lifesaving recognition for facilitating more lifesaving courses and accreditations than any other group in Queensland.

“Participant numbers for Swim Fit’s aqua aerobics and training academy programs have grown significantly during their tenure and they are set to deliver some new and exciting opportunities for our community into the future, particularly in the lead up to the 2032 Olympics.”

Swim Fit Sunshine Coast Director Grant Belcher said he was excited about the opportunity to continue delivering high quality service to the Sunshine Coast Community at the Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre.

“Over the past 27 years of operation on the Sunshine Coast, Swim Fit has created a strong and rich relationship and history with the facilities we have the privilege to operate,” Mr Belcher said.

“We have played a major part in the lives of local Sunshine Coast families with many children having fond memories of participating in swimming lessons, school carnivals, or general recreational swimming for fun.

“Swim Fit is very excited to remain the lessee and manager of Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre and continuing to deliver great service and the family-friendly environment our amazing onsite team has created.”

The Caloundra Aquatic Centre will remain closed until June 30 while council delivers essential capital works upgrades to the much-loved facility. City Venue Management will start its new tenure at the facility from Friday, July 1 (weather permitting).

The popular adjoining skate park will also reopen free of charge to the public from July 1 following some minor works and will no longer form part of the Caloundra Aquatic Centre lease.
