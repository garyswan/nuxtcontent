You’ll find family fun this New Year’s Eve with fireworks displays at Mooloolaba, Caloundra and Coolum.

[Caloundra](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17410863-a/caloundra-nye-celebrations-2022)
&#x20;celebrations kick off from 4pm with fireworks at 9.30pm while [Coolum Beach](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17203606-a/sunshine-coast-new-years-eve-2022-mooloolaba)
&#x20;will light up at 8.30pm.

In [Mooloolaba](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17203606-a/sunshine-coast-new-years-eve-2022-mooloolaba)
, there are two fireworks displays – one each at 8.30pm and midnight and from 5pm you’ll find food trucks and live music at this glass, alcohol and drug-free celebration.

Young children will love the Paw Patrol show and meet and greets, and for older children, there’s a glow zone, big bubbles and interactive glow shows.

The Beach Zone caters for under 18s and, from 7pm, you’ll find Red Frogs on deck as well as a free bungy trampoline.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Creative Arts and Events Coordinator Janine Symons said the addition of Red Frogs would help provide a fun, safe space.

“Red Frogs provide a positive peer presence,” Ms Symons said.

“Their crews are able to ‘read the room’, ensuring youth crowds are engaged, having fun and, most importantly, are safe.”

Information about the Mooloolaba New Year’s Eve celebrations, including entertainment, traffic, parking and more is available at [SCEvents](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17203606-a/sunshine-coast-new-years-eve-2022-mooloolaba)
.

Sunshine Coast Council, Community Portfolio Cr David Law said no matter the celebration, safety was always the priority.

“We’re encouraging everyone heading out this New Year’s Eve to carefully plan their trip home,” Cr Law said.

“Our event teams are working closely with Queensland Police and together we’re urging people to download and update their ride-share apps, organise a designated driver or use public transport, to ensure they get home safely.

“Animal and environmental safety is also important, so we’re referring to [RSPCA advice](https://www.rspcasa.org.au/pets-in-fireworks/)
&#x20;for those with pets and animals, and have put a range of measures in place to ensure the event is delivered as [sustainably](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17203606-a/sunshine-coast-new-years-eve-2022-mooloolaba)
&#x20;as possible.”

Mooloolaba New Year’s Eve 2022 is a Sunshine Coast Council event, delivered in partnership with the Queensland Police Service and other Emergency Services (SES, QFES, Red Frogs, QAS and QEMS).

While not run by Sunshine Coast Council, Caloundra and Coolum New Year’s Eve events are supported by Council. You can find out more about those events at [SCEvents](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17203606-a/sunshine-coast-new-years-eve-2022-mooloolaba)
