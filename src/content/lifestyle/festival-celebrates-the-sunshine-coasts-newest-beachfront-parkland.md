The wait is almost over for residents and visitors to be some of the first to experience the Sunshine Coast’s most exciting new beachfront parkland.

Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland will open for the Queensland school holidays, featuring a vibrant and free community event on Saturday, July 2.

Organised by the Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce with the support of Sunshine Coast Council, the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival will celebrate the grand opening of the Northern Parkland with live music, markets, family-friendly entertainment, and more.

The announcement comes as the final pieces of the Northern Parkland’s adventure playground, the impressive [‘Pandanus Towers’](https://oursc.com.au/community/epic-new-nature-inspired-play-towers-and-slides-are-coming-to-mooloolabas-northern-parkland)
&#x20;and slides, were crane lifted into place today (Monday June 6).

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the playground would be a huge drawcard for residents and visitors.

“There’s really nothing else like it on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Natoli said.

“I’m sure Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland will be one of the most popular destinations in the region when it opens for the school holidays.

“There is an incredible adventure playground, beautiful parkland, new picnic and barbecue spaces, and unencumbered ocean views from every angle.

“It’s yet another great reason to visit Mooloolaba.

“You’ll enjoy strolling the local shops, dining at one of the many cafes and restaurants and unwinding at some of the most stunning beachfront parkland in the region.

“Mark your diary for Saturday July 2. It won’t just be just the children eager to check it out.”

Inspired by all things in, on and under the sea, the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival will feature all the latest parkland additions including an epic adventure playground, oceanfront picnic and barbecue areas, and premier viewing decks for those magic photo moments.

Meet a mermaid, spot incredible sand sculptures, soak up live music or wander the sunset markets.

At ‘Ocean Alley’ on the Esplanade, there will be ocean displays and workshops, delicious food, free rides and face painting, and activities for everyone to enjoy.

Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland is the first new community space to be unveiled as part of the multi-stage [Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Mooloolaba-Foreshore-Revitalisation-Project)
&#x20;project.

The multiple stage Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation (MFR) project is guided by the [Placemaking Mooloolaba Master Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Place-Making-Mooloolaba-Master-Plan)
 endorsed by council in December 2015.

As part of the Placemaking Mooloolaba Master Plan process, council carried out detailed community consultation. From 2012-2015, more than 3,000 participants took part in the consultation exercise which received a very high level of community support (82%).

The Stage One Northern Parkland was developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package in association with Sunshine Coast Council.  

Sunshine Coast Council has committed $6.9 million towards Stage One Northern Parkland and is proud to have local firms design and deliver this new community precinct.
