It’s time to dust off the helmet and get your wheels ready for another National Ride2School Day on the Sunshine Coast.

Students who register to pedal, scoot or skate to school on Friday, March 25 will be in the running to win one of four $500 bike shop vouchers on offer by Sunshine Coast Council.

Thousands of students from more than 70 schools across the region will celebrate National Ride2School Day.

The annual nation-wide tradition is a great opportunity for students to get outside and incorporate healthy and sustainable travel options into their everyday lives.

Eligible participants in council’s bike shop vouchers must [register online](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07eixf6h5v6724cfec&oseq=&c=&ch=)
, be school-aged children attending a school in the Sunshine Coast Council area and ride, scoot or skate to school on National Ride2School Day 2022.

Sunshine Coast Council Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said Ride2School was a really good initiative to further encourage young people to maintain or develop healthy and sustainable transport habits, especially considering the Olympic events coming to the region in 2032. 

“Council is encouraging youngsters to get on their bikes, scooter or skate to school, or if they live a fair distance away, commit to riding even just part of the way,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Giving active travel a go over sitting in traffic in a private vehicle even for just one day a week is a great way to experience what it offers and build more sustainable, healthy, lifelong habits that are great for you and seriously good for the planet.

“What a bonus that it also helps reduce traffic and parking congestion and makes our school zones safer. 

“Our region now has more than 1400 kilometres of sealed pathways and we’re moving as quickly as possible to improve the pathway network with an emphasis on those around school precincts.”

Don’t miss out! [Register](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07eixf6h5v6724cfec&oseq=&c=&ch=)
&#x20;on council’s website before 5pm on Friday, March 25, 2022 to enter the draw for your chance to win.
