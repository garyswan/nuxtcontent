“As we rebuild our program’s schedule this year, Pilates is brand new to this dynamic and evolving program and will be held every Thursday at the YMCA Caloundra,” Cr Law said.

“We’re also pleased to have partnered with Sunshine Coast Bushwalkers Inc. who will host five guided bushwalks from next month so book a walk now as places are limited.

“Now is the ideal time to show your support for these activities which are run in a safe, supportive and friendly environment. It’s through regular participation and community support that these popular programs can continue to thrive.”
