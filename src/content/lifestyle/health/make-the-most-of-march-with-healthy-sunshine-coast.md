Yoga mats, running shoes and water bottles are mobilising across the region with more than 2000 people joining Council’s Healthy Sunshine Coast movement this year.

Classes kicked off last month (February) and additional low cost activities have been added to the March line-up of classes.

Two new Active Seniors classes will start in Caloundra today (2 March) at the YMCA, while a strength and functional movement class will take place at Caloundra Indoor Stadium from 3 March and a class favourite, Zumba\@Kings, will return to Kings Beach Park every Wednesday afternoon from 3 March.  For people in the southern hinterland there is also a new class in Mooloolah.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see strong interest in this year’s program.

“We’ve got outdoor classes at Bokarina, Beerwah and Yandina, aqua fitness at Nambour and Little Mountain Aquatic Centres, plus sessions at Mooloolaba TAFE, Nambour Gym and the Range Community Gym at Mapleton and lots of yoga on offer,” Cr Law said.

“Now that people have joined it’s time to start your fitness journey by selecting a class to attend. The benefits flow-on not just physically, but mentally and socially as well. 

“We are strongly committed to inspiring healthy, active communities as part of our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.”

People can choose to move and reconnect with nature in a park as part of Parks Week (6-14 March), with free weekly classes held in Maroochy Bushland Botanic Garden, Buderim Town Park and Kings Beach Park Amphitheatre. 

On Saturday 20 March, Healthy Sunshine Coast will celebrate Harmony Day with a special “Come and Try” event in the Contemplation Garden at Maroochy Bushland Botanic Garden from 8.30-11am.

On the day, Healthy Sunshine Coast instructors will demonstrate yoga, tai chi and group fitness – try one or all three. You’ll also be able to experience the unique mindful Labyrinth Walk.
