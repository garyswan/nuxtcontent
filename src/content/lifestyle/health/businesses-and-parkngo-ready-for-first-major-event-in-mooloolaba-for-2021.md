This weekend’s Mooloolaba Triathlon is close to selling out and Mooloolaba businesses are ready to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to locals and visitors alike.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Cr Jason O’Pray said the event attracted more than 4000 athletes to the region, which was a real shot in the arm for our accommodation providers and worth around $5 million to the region’s economy.

“And while the athletes are out on the course, our Mooloolaba businesses are keen to serve the locals as usual,” Cr O’Pray said.

“Plenty of parking is now available within walking distance to shops, cafes and restaurants with easy access to support businesses by shopping, eating and spending locally.”

The main event will take place on Sunday 14 March from 6.45am and event preparations have been underway from 9 March.

Mooloolaba Triathlon will follow a Queensland Health approved COVID Safe Event Plan.

Support crew and spectators can follow event progress by downloading the Mooloolaba Tri app (available on Apple and Android) and track athletes virtually. Those who do come to Mooloolaba on race day are asked to spectate from COVID Safe businesses along the course.

Event organisers, The IRONMAN Group Oceania have reduced traffic and car park impacts where possible and distributed a flyer across the region last month to provide advance notice of the changed traffic conditions.

Race Director Toby Keegan said the event had previously closed 320 car spaces over the week of the event and an additional 100 spaces on the weekend.

“This year, 120 car spaces will be used for the event set up and 80 over the weekend, so that we can minimise any inconvenience while showcasing the spectacular Sunshine Coast and delivering a world class event and significant economic benefits for the region,” Mr Keegan said.

“Athletes will transition on parkland along Parkyn Parade and the car park opposite Pier 33,” he said.

The new transition site will result in changed traffic conditions to access Parkyn Parade with a detour through The Wharf car park Saturday between 5.30am and 9am and Sunday between 5am and 11.30am. The Wharf car park remains partially open for the duration of the event, the double story car park will not be accessible.

A short section of the Boardwalk will also be used as part of the run route from 5am to 9am Saturday and 5am to 11am on Sunday. Event marshals and temporary bollards will be in place to separate pedestrians and runners, while maintaining two-way pedestrian access.

Access to the new eight-storey ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park will be via Smith Street and Brisbane Road for most of the weekend. A temporary U-turn facility will be in place on Walan Street to allow access via Smith Street on Saturday between 5am and 9am and Sunday between 5am and 10am for motorists travelling from Brisbane Road.

ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park offers more than 700 public parking spaces including 13 parking spaces for people with a disability, 54 motorcycle spaces and 50 bicycle spaces with easy access to the beach, foreshore, shops, cafes and restaurants.
