A vibrant, shady and inclusive link between the Maroochydore City Centre (CBD), Cotton Tree and Ocean Street precincts is finalised and ready for construction along First Avenue, Maroochydore later this year.

The upgrade will provide businesses, residents and visitors a more inviting space to live, work and play.

Sunshine Coast Council is encouraging the community, traders and residents to come along to a Design Information Night to learn more about the major streetscape upgrade which will be explained in detail.

**Save the Date to hear about the design in detail!**

*   Wednesday 27 July, 2022
*   6:15pm
*   Maroochy RSL, 105 Memorial Ave, Maroochydore

The design connects First Avenue and the newly expanded CBD, Aerodrome Road and surrounds, including The Esplanade and Duporth Avenue.

The First Avenue upgrade, in partnership with the Queensland Government, is a critical step in connecting the newly expanded CBD with the other business and recreation precincts.

The upgrade is all about improving the built urban environment with shaded and attractive open space to conduct business, enjoy the local restaurants and actively move about more safely and efficiently.

The First Avenue Streetscape design is final and construction will begin later this year.

A Construction Information night will also take place in September 2022 for traders, to better understand the construction process – there will be more details closer to the date on council’s website.

*This project is proudly funded by the Queensland Government’s South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program in association with council.*
