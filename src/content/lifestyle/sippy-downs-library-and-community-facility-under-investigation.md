Plans to investigate the delivery of a community facility with library services and community meeting spaces within the emerging Sippy Downs Town Centre are underway.

The potential facility could be located on council-owned land in the Sippy Downs Town Centre and would cater for a projected population of approximately 45,000 residents within Sippy Downs and Palmview area by 2041.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said $1 million was allocated to the project for planning and design to occur, over the next two years.

“The planning stage will include feasibility assessments and concept design sketches to develop suitable functional areas and cost options as well as schematic designs and construction documentation,” Cr Dickson said.  

“The Sippy Downs and Palmview communities are experiencing lots of new residents and are home to a large number of schools and families who could benefit from this type of local facility.

“Undertaking this preliminary planning and design will enable council to progress discussions with the State and Federal Governments regarding the cost and options for delivery.

“Council’s preliminary investigations support the desire to deliver a flexible multipurpose space that could host a range of functions, with access to a library service.

“A community facility of this nature supports community development and strengthens the ability for connected community groups to establish and thrive.

“This would provide a great space for our Division 6 community to gather, socialise, recreate and learn, and I look forward to providing more updates as the project progresses.”

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Cr Maria Suarez said our Environment and Liveability Strategy aimed to ensure our community had access to social infrastructure to meet their needs and great places and spaces for all to enjoy.

“This project will help us achieve those objectives,” Cr Suarez said.

“Community facilities such as libraries, community and performance venues, aquatic centres and sports halls are all important for our liveability and to connect our communities.

“They help bring people together to meet, enjoy recreational activities, be creative, develop and access information, services and programs, to create a sense of place.  

“Our libraries in particular position themselves at the heart of their communities. They are individual, unique and flexible environments, designed to complement the locality and community they represent.

“Council is investing in community facilities across the region to cater for our growing population and provide spaces for our community to connect, grow and thrive."
