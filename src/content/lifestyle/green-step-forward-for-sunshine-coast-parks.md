Our Sunshine Coast recreation parks offer a great range of opportunities for everyone and now, with the benefit of feedback from our community, a new plan has been developed to provide even better experiences for users of these important community assets.

Sunshine Coast Council has today (December 9) endorsed the Recreation Parks Plan which outlines the strategic direction for parks across the region until 2031.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson thanked the community for the extensive feedback received during the consultation period, which was held from February to April 2021.

“The draft plan was well received by our community and there was strong support for the vision and principles which will guide the future planning, management and use of our open space network,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The Plan also provides guidance on the appropriate functions, activities and infrastructure to be delivered in recreation parks, as well as delivering spaces for our community to enjoy.

“Through research, policy development, community input and planning, we can respond to changes to current conditions and make the right decisions at the right time for the betterment of our community’s enjoyment of its recreation parks.

“Protecting our natural assets was a key value identified by our community, as was providing more shade and associated infrastructure to make our parks a more engaging experience.”

The Recreation Parks Plan is one of many ways council is delivering on its [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;(ELS), which provides long-term direction to guide growth and shape the future of our region.

Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said our parks provided the region with space for social, recreational and cultural activities, connecting people with nature and providing a huge variety of opportunities to enjoy.

“Sunshine Coast’s parks and open green spaces enhance the natural character of our region,” Cr Suarez said.

“For many of us, our experiences through the COVID-19 pandemic have made us appreciate that much more, just how wonderful it is to get outside and explore.

“We live in a very special part of Australia, with diverse green spaces – from those of significance to the cultural heritage of First Nations peoples, enviable coastal environments, our majestic hinterland and everywhere in between.

“Each park within our landscape complements the character of, and adds to, what our community wants to see as the future of our region.

“First Nations people have long believed that identity and landscape are inherently connected and I think our parks provide an opportunity to learn about history, culture and nature in a stimulating setting.”
