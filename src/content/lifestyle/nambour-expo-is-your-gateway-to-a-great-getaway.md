Whether you’re planning a getaway, needing vacation inspiration, or chasing a new way to catch fish, the 2022 Nambour Expo has you covered.

The Sunshine Coast’s longest running outdoor adventure showcase will be held at the Nambour Showgrounds from April 1-3. Expo Director Bob Carroll said the event would feature more than 130 local and national brands.

“This year’s Nambour Expo will feature an enormous range of the very latest caravans, hybrid vans, camper trailers, camping, boating and fishing gear, as well as accessories and great information about holiday destinations,” Mr Carroll said.

“This event is all about helping people find ways to explore more of our beautiful state of Queensland.

“A Sunshine Coast company is also set to launch an exciting new product which adds scent to fishing lures.  

“The Nambour Showgrounds will be a fantastic location for the Expo and we’re expecting more than 12,000 visitors through the gates across the three days.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the Nambour Expo complemented our region’s healthy, smart and creative lifestyle.

“With opportunities for all of us to get out and about and travel safely once again, the Nambour Expo is a fantastic event to hopefully inspire more people to experience more of our beautiful Sunshine Coast and beyond,” Cr O’Pray said.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest caravan and outdoor adventure expo ever held in our region. It’ll be a real one-stop-shop for anyone who loves the great outdoors, so I really encourage locals and visitors to mark it in their calendars and make a weekend of it on April 1-3.”
