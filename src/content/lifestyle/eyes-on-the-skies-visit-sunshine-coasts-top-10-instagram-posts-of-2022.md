The good people of Instagram have spoken with their thumbs and photographs of sunrises and sunsets are in, having dominated [Visit Sunshine Coast’s](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/ZhIbCJyB1LCBZLVJUVObNu?domain=instagram.com/)
&#x20;top 10 Instagram posts of 2022.

Fairy floss skies, blood orange sunsets and indigo hues were recurring themes in the year’s top 10, with eight of the top spot’s photos and reels of show stopping skies.

This year’s number one – a stunning sunset video shot through the palm trees at First Point, Noosa Heads – paints a pretty picture of gentle rolling waves, turquoise waters and golden clouds.

The video was taken by local photographer Marissa Knight and has racked up more than 23,300 likes and been viewed more than 650,000 times.

In a fitting twist, exactly 2023 Instagram users have saved the video for later, presumably giving themselves fresh Sunshine Coast travel inspiration for the year ahead.

Visit Sunshine Coast CEO Matt Stoeckel said he was thrilled to see that five of the seven photographers that made this year’s top 10 were based on the Sunshine Coast.

“No one knows the Sunshine Coast better than our locals, who are without a doubt the best ambassadors we could ask for to help promote our region to visitors,” Mr Stoeckel said.

“This year’s top 10 is an incredible highlights reel of what we have to offer here on the Sunshine Coast.

“We know that visitors love our beaches, and that’s certainly reflected in the top 10, but people come here because we offer so much more than that as a destination.

“From the rolling hills of the Hinterland to our pristine waterfalls and vibrant rainforests there’s so much beauty to be adored and explored here, and our Instagram is a wonderful way to showcase our visitors’ - and locals’ - sunshine moments that make the region so special to them.”

Ms Knight, who can be found on Instagram at [@marissaknightphotography](http://@marissaknightphotography)
, also took out 7th and 10th place for her photos of Noosa and Coolum Beach respectively.

“I’m so ecstatic at taking the top reel spot,” Ms Knight said.

“I remember that sunset so clearly, so colourful, it was one of the best all year and I captured so many beautiful images from that afternoon.

“My passion is capturing that magical light at sunrise and sunset, the colour explosion stays with you forever.”

Having been a Sunny Coast local for the past 28 years Ms Knight has plenty of suggestions on where to capture beautiful photographs of the region.

“I have so many favourite spots on the Sunshine Coast, Noosa Heads, Lake Weyba, Sunshine Beach, Coolum Beaches and One Tree Hill Maleny to name a few,” Ms Knight said.
