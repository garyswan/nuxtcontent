Australia’s leading caravan manufacturer has shown its confidence in the Sunshine Coast, investing in a new $7.5 million 5000 square metre facility in Coolum Eco Industrial Park.

ZONE RV is a locally owned and operated business which manufactures and assembles composite caravans.

The thriving off-road caravan specialists will continue to occupy 6000 square metres in two facilities within the industrial park and after just two years, is expanding its premises as a result of the surge in demand for the company’s products combined with the growth in the caravan industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

ZONE RV’s new premises is on track to inject a forecast $31 million into the economy during construction and ongoing operations and will generate 124 new full-time positions.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson visited the ZONE RV headquarters this morning (January 25) to congratulate the local company on its success and thank them for their contribution to the region.

“I am pleased that ZONE RV has been, and continues to be, supported by council through its Sunshine Coast Economic Resurgence Plan,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The resurgence plan was set up in response to COVID-19, our goal being to provide support to local businesses and to assist the region’s economic recovery, by accelerating large shovel-ready construction projects such as this one.  

“The business support measures and incentives include a rebate on eligible development application fees and staged payment options for infrastructure charges.

“Council recognised very early in this pandemic that business support would be critical to how our region fared in the face of COVID and the resurgence plan was just one of many initiatives we implemented.”

&#x20;Chief Executive Officer Adrian Toft said he was very excited the new facility on the Sunshine Coast would have the biggest 3D printer in the Southern Hemisphere.

“At 22 meters x 5 meters wide, it is huge,” Mr Toft said.

“We’re hiring now and if you have an interest in automation, robotics and mechatronics, come and talk to us.

“We’re looking for apprentices, graduates, composite technicians and tradespeople.”
