Sunshine Coast residents are invited to get active and wander through nature with Buderim’s brand-new section of boardwalk now open between Sage Street and Royal Drive.

Previously a dirt track, the community can now enjoy a seamless elevated stroll through the rainforest which meanders along the creek bed towards Tom Rickards Park at the top of Buderim Mountain.

The popular pathway holds a special space in the hearts of the Buderim community as somewhere to enjoy nature, walk, ride and exercise furry friends.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford said the new 100 metre boardwalk would ensure greater accessibility to the reserve with minimal impact to our natural environment.

“The Sage Street Buderim boardwalk is a great community asset now – and a wonderful way for our community to get more active,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Offering a smoother journey for those using wheelchairs, walkers and prams, the new boardwalk is fully accessible to ensure more of our community can get out and enjoy this pristine environment.

“The structure is made entirely from 100% Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer composites and recycled plastic elements and is raised above ground level to mitigate regular flooding that occurs with extreme rain events.

“So along with providing improved connectivity and pedestrian safety, it’s environmentally friendly, reduces erosion caused by informal walking tracks, and will require minimal future maintenance.

“The other great thing about this project is the zero harm to vegetation approach that was used to design and construct the new boardwalk.

“Not a single tree was removed,” Cr Hungerford said.

The $150 thousand Sage Street Buderim boardwalk project was fully funded by Sunshine Coast Councils Minor Capital Works Program after receiving support and nomination by Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford.

Council thanks Buderim residents for their patience and understanding as this community facility was developed.
