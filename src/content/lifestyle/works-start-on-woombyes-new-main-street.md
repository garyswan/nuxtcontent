You might have noticed some early streetscape works have started along Blackall Street, Woombye as part of Council’s Streetscape Capital Works Program.

Since November 2020, Council has undertaken community engagement, which has informed the streetscape design. Council is now progressing into the pre-works construction phase of the $1.55 million dollar streetscape upgrade.

Council is undertaking the streetscape works across two phases to minimise impacts on the traders and visitors to Woombye.

The initial phase will be constructing additional car parking on Hill St, Blackall St and Keli St.

These works are expected to be completed by the end of the month, before phase two construction starts mid-2022 on the streetscape and landscape improvement works.

Shady street trees and garden beds will be planted to cool the footpath, beautify and extend the green, leafy look and feel, to the west of the town centre.

The works will also highlight a pedestrian friendly street by improving footpaths and crossings, making it easier to cross the street, slowing traffic and improving access for all abilities.

Council, in partnership with the Queensland Government has allocated $1.55 million to deliver the streetscape improvements. The State Government has contributed $500,000 of the total funding under the $100 million South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.
