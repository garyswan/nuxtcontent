Plastic Free July helps millions of people be part of the solution to plastic pollution. This helps to ensure we can have cleaner streets, oceans, and beautiful communities by choosing to refuse single-use plastics. Last year more than 300 million people globally participated.

Local Councils across Australia are taking the Plastic Free July Challenge, reducing their own plastic use and connecting homes, workplaces, schools and business to spread solutions to plastic pollution. 

As a Council Member, Sunshine Coast Council is supporting our community to choose to refuse single-use plastics directly, and doing our part to alleviate the recycling crisis, reducing landfill waste, and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Within Council, we’re pledging to make a difference by reviewing our procurement processes, updating our Sustainable Catering Guidelines and promoting a culture of best practice to avoid single use plastics across our buildings, facilities and at Council supported and run events.

Other ongoing initiatives to encourage waste avoidance include composting initiatives, reusable bag stands, soft plastics collection and sharing ideas through internal challenges like our Zero Net Emissions Challenge.

The Plastic Free July challenge provides resources and ideas to help participants (and millions of others around the world) reduce single-use plastic waste every day at home, work, school, and in the community.
