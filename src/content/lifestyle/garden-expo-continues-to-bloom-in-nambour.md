Australia’s second largest garden show, the Queensland Garden Expo held annually at the Nambour Showgrounds, will now enter negotiations with Sunshine Coast Council to lock in a three-year sponsorship arrangement.

Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the expo, first held in 1985, was second only to the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show in terms of size.

“It is estimated that the expo will collectively attract 23,850 exhibitors, speakers, support personnel and attendees from outside the Sunshine Coast, generating more than 44,000 visitor nights per year,” Cr O’Pray said.

“It has the potential to offer a real shot in the arm for our tourism industry which is so important to our local economy after a tumultuous couple of years due to the impacts of COVID.

The direct economic benefit from visitor room nights and the spend in the local economy has been conservatively estimated at $9 million.

Community contributions are also of significant value, with more than 30 community clubs benefiting from an estimated $50,000 each year through their involvement.

The Sunshine Coast Events Board, which includes community leaders from a wide range of professions, recommended that council provide sponsorship for the 2022-2024 Queensland Garden Expo events.

The next three day event is scheduled for July 8-10, 2022, and garden expo lovers are encouraged to subscribe to receive event updates at [www.qldgardenexpo.com.au](http://www.qldgardenexpo.com.au)
