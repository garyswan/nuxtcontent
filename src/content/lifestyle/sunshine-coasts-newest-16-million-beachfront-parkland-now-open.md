The scaffolding is down, more than 10,000 plants are in the ground, the barbecues are ready, and the finishing touches have been made to the $16 million world-class beachfront parkland at Mooloolaba.

Council officially unveiled the Mooloolaba Northern Parkland today (June 28), marking a milestone to be remembered by the Sunshine Coast community for many years to come.

One hectare of multi-level parklands is now open for locals and visitors flocking to the famed foreshore, offering hours of healthy and active beachfront fun on one of the region’s most beloved coastlines.

The breathtaking spot, nestled between the Alexandra Headland and Mooloolaba Esplanade, extends 350 metres along the beachfront.

The Mooloolaba Northern Parkland is first stage of the [Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Mooloolaba-Foreshore-Revitalisation-Project)
, which, over the coming years,  will increase beachfront parkland in Mooloolaba by 40 per cent.

It is expected to lure thousands of additional visitors to the area, providing an estimated $5.5 million\* worth of extra expenditure in local businesses each year.

It will also prepare the Sunshine Coast for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympics world stage.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the new parkland would ensure Mooloolaba remained an attractive and competitive destination.

“The Northern Parkland offers a space for our community and I’m proud council has delivered this important first stage for everyone to enjoy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“From family barbecues to golden days at the beach, children’s parties at the adventure playground, sunsets on the viewing deck – maybe even a marriage proposal or two – Mooloolaba will create lifelong memories.

“The pristine foreshore is one of Mooloolaba’s most important community assets and is surrounded by the popular shopping, dining and accommodation precinct recognised as the region’s tourism heart.

“The area provides a significant opportunity to drive renewed visitation and investment into the precinct, and indeed, the whole Sunshine Coast region.

“Throughout the community engagement process for the Placemaking Mooloolaba Masterplan in 2015, the community told us to retain and enhance Mooloolaba’s natural beauty, renew spaces along the beachfront, and provide more exciting parks.

“The community also stressed a need to reinvigorate Mooloolaba as a place for locals and to attract more permanent residents to the area.

“The Northern Parkland ticks all of these boxes.

“Drawing inspiration from the coastal town’s character and community values, the Northern Parkland is now a distinctive destination that celebrates the natural beauty and diversity of Mooloolaba.

“A key focus for the parkland is prioritising accessibility and inclusivity so all members of our community can enjoy and access the boardwalk, playground and public amenities,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The expansive boardwalk and coastal pathways enable people with disabilities, including wheelchair users, to enjoy the views and sit alongside family and friends.

“Inclusive play elements have also been incorporated into the playground – features which foster the physical, cognitive, sensory and social skills in children of all abilities.”

Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said the Palaszczuk Government was delivering for the Sunshine Coast through the Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package and the South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.

“Queensland’s plan for economic recovery is underway and is delivering for the Sunshine Coast, creating jobs and bringing additional investment into the region,” Assistant Minister Boyd said.

“Projects like the Mooloolaba foreshore upgrade bring communities together and make tourists more likely to pick Mooloolaba for their next holiday.

“The upgrades will make the foreshore one of the best places to check out the stunning coastal views in Mooloolaba.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli echoed the excitement, saying he was thrilled to welcome the community into the new parkland.

“Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland is now open and ready to be enjoyed over the school holidays,” Cr Natoli said.

“The new Northern Parkland is yet another reason to visit stunning Mooloolaba, and I’d like to thank local residents and businesses for their cooperation during the construction period.”

A renewed seawall, bordered by trailing vegetation, protects the foreshore from the impact of intense storms and erosion.

Revegetation, weed removal and landscaping was a vital component of the project which was [recently recognised](https://oursc.com.au/community/green-thumbs-up-for-mooloolabas-northern-parkland)
&#x20;by the Australian Institute of Horticulture Inc for its excellence and environmentally responsible design.

The $16 million Stage One Northern Parkland was developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package in association with Sunshine Coast Council.  

Council is proud to have local firms design and deliver this new community precinct including main contractor Murphy’s Builders supported by Place Design Group, Barlow Shelley Engineers, The Jetty Specialists, Fleetwood and Urban Play among the many project contributors.
