Sunshine Coast Council today endorsed its 2020/21 Annual Report, demonstrating council’s strong commitment to creating a safer, secure future for our community and supporting recovery from the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 

The annual report is an important communication tool for council to inform our Sunshine Coast community on council’s delivery of the operational plan over the 2020/21 financial year and our progress towards the delivery of the Sunshine Coast Corporate Plan 2020-2024.

The report is structured to capture major highlights achieved by council over the last financial year and shows the commitment to achieving our vision for the region through reporting on specific corporate plan goal measures. It includes council’s annual disclosures, the community financial report and audited financial statements - and proudly, Council received its 13th consecutive unmodified audit opinion the external auditors, the Queensland Audit Office for our financial statements.

This year, the annual report has captured council’s ongoing agility and adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic - to respond to uncertainty, short notice and new and emerging risks – in the interests of helping to keep our community safe and well-supported.

Importantly, the annual report showcases the Sunshine Coast community’s resilience by working together, supporting each other, and partnering for success.

For more on the annual report, visit council’s website [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)

Printed copies will be available for viewing at council libraries and customer service centres from the week commencing 6 December 2021.
