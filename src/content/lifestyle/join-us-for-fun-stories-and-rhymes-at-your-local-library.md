Nurture your child’s love of language by reading and singing together at Sunshine Coast Council’s free weekly early literacy sessions at library branches across the region.

Storytime and Rhymetime are back on at your local Sunshine Coast Libraries from Tuesday, October 5.

Did you know that up to 90 per cent of a child’s brain development happens in the first five years of the child’s life? And that the more you read and talk with your child, the more their brain responds.

This makes Council’s Libraries a great place for families to visit and the storytime and rhymetime sessions a great way to encourage enthusiastic young learners.  

The Storytime sessions are aimed at children aged two to five and are the perfect, fun activity for parents and caregivers to give their children the best start to life.

The sessions include stories, rhymes and songs to encourage language and listening skills, which also promote attention and curiosity.

The Rhymetime sessions are designed for ages six months to two years and aim to help your baby develop pre-literacy and language skills.

To meet COVID-19 safety requirements, attendance at Storytime and Rhymetime sessions is by registration only. Every person attending the session (including parents, caregivers, children and babies) must book a space.

The community is reminded to stay COVID alert and stay at home if unwell.

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in to the Library using the Queensland Government QR code and follow Queensland Health directions including mandatory mask wearing, unless under 12 years or exempt for other reasons.

Registration opens each Monday for the following week’s programs.

Sunshine Coast Libraries also offer a range of online early literacy sessions and resources to aid your child's development during their first five years.

For more information and to register head to the Library website: library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

Please note Storytime and Rhymetime sessions are not held on public holidays or during school holidays.
