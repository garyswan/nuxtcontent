Want to get into growing food at home? Residents have the chance to get their hands on free heirloom seeds and learn from TV gardening celebrity Costa Georgiadis as he shares the patch-to-plate secrets of his great-grandmother’s famous spanakopita, back by popular demand.

The Grow It Local initiative is about to launch its autumn edition of the Seed Service, aimed at beginners and seasoned growers alike, as part of a nationwide mission to get more people growing, sharing and eating locally grown food.

Through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council’s Living Smart program and Grow It Local, the first 100 Sunshine Coast residents to register for the Seed Service at [Grow It Local](http://www.growitlocal.com/free-seed-service)
&#x20;will receive heirloom seed varieties including kale (black Toscana), rainbow chard and spinach (Bloomsdale).

Participants will learn to grow with Costa alongside a national community of backyard, balcony, window-sill and community gardeners.

This edition is a Greek-inspired, seed-to-spanakopita adventure and celebration of Australia’s favourite gardening guru, Costa Georgiadis, back for a second season after last year’s popularity: great news for anyone who missed out, or return growers hoping to fine-tune their gardening and cooking skills for a next-level feast.

All participants will have access to expert videos and how-to articles to guide their growing journey and can ask questions for personalised troubleshooting from the Grow It Local team.

Grow It Local co-founder Paul West said the initiative had a mission to bring fun and creativity to food growing.

“Grow it Local was born of the belief that if everyone grew their own food, we’d be happier and healthier, our nails would be dirtier, and our smiles would be bigger,” Paul said.  

“We’d compost more and waste less, and life, in general would be juicier and more delicious.”

Residents, businesses, schools and community groups across are invited to register for the Grow It Local Seed Service [online](http://www.growitlocal.com/free-seed-service)
&#x20;from February 27.

If you miss this year’s free seed service, you can still access all the expert advice and grow-along resources.

Why not BYO seeds and source locally from [Green Harvest](https://greenharvest.com.au/SeedOrganic/OrganicSeedIndex.html)
&#x20;– look for the following varieties so you can still join the fun:

*   Spinach English 'Bloomsdale Long Standing'
*   Silverbeet 'Colour Mix'
*   Kale 'Cavolo Nero' 

You can even grab seeds through your local garden supplies store. Better still, share your seeds with a friend or two.

Growing food at home, schools or community gardens helps to foster a connection to nature and healthy lifestyles, and is an accessible way to live more sustainably within our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.
