With this rampant weedy vine’s flowers on full show, now is the time to defend our region’s natives from its smothering embrace.

Coastal morning glory (also known as mile-a-minute) and its hinterland cousin, blue morning glory, are now in full bloom: perfect targets for identification and management.

Both vines grow rapidly to smother our native trees, shrubs and groundcovers, depriving them of sunlight and nutrients.

The distinctive funnel-shaped flowers make both species easy to identify as they overrun trees across the region.

Both vines can be spread by plant parts and seeds.

To manage these vines in your area that are growing up trees and not along the ground, cut the stem at the base and remove all roots.

If they are growing along the ground, pull them out at the roots and remove the whole plant from the ground so it doesn’t regrow from broken stem fragments.
