Sunshine Coast residents and visitors are invited to join in a community event on Wednesday, November 30, to unite and show support for victims of domestic and family violence. 

The event, hosted by Sunshine Coast Council and supported by the Make It Stop committee, will take place as part of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, which starts on November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until Friday, December 10 – Human Rights Day.

The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is a global initiative to address gender inequalities and eradicate violence against women and girls around the world.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was proud to partner with Make It Stop for a third year, and help plant 200 native seedlings as an act of solidarity and support for victims of domestic and family violence.

“Domestic and family violence has no place in our community and we have zero tolerance for it,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This year the United Nations global theme for 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is ‘UNITE! Activism to end violence against women and girls.

“Help us UNITE! for global actions to increase awareness and share knowledge. 

“The initiative aims to increase awareness of gender-based violence to promote prevention and give hope to the belief that a world without violence is possible.

“We encourage the community to help raise public awareness of domestic and family violence in our community at the Seeds of Hope Tree Planting morning.

“The native trees and shrubs planted will be a lasting legacy to acknowledge victims of domestic and family violence on the Sunshine Coast as well as rehabilitating and building resilience in our coastal dunes.”

Make It Stop Chairman Mark Kratzmann encouraged anyone who may need help to know they were not alone.

“Make It Stop continues to raise awareness and educate people about the impacts, signs and types of domestic and family violence as well as ways to seek help and provide support,” Mr Kratzmann said.

“There are many support services available for people experiencing domestic and family violence and I encourage you to please reach out for help.”
