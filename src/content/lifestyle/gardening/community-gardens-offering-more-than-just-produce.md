The popularity of community gardens has blossomed over the past couple of years and it’s a trend we’re absolutely digging.

Community gardens offer a place where people can come together to share gardening skills, grow food and meet new people. These gardens play a key role in our neighbourhoods by helping build a sense of community, a connection with the environment and provide an opportunity to learn about sustainable living.

There are currently nine active community gardens in our region and each space is unique depending on the size, environment and how it is managed.

The Buddina Community Garden was established in 2011 and is tucked away next to the Kawana Library and Buddina State School.

Stroll through the gardens and enjoy the range of vegetables, herbs, flowers, fruit as well as housing chickens, insect motels, composting and a worm garden.

President of the Buddina Community Garden Heather Pavitt said the garden was popular with people of all ages and gardening interests.

“While many of our members and visitors come here with gardening as the focus, they soon find our community garden is a place for connecting, education, creativity, events and so much more,” Ms Pavitt said.

“Our garden is open to the public and visitors are welcome to pick and collect vegetables, herbs, bush tucker and flowers or participate in our monthly working bee.

“The garden also offers raised garden beds for members to plant and grow their own produce of their choosing.”

The Buddina Community Garden recently hosted a ‘thank you’ morning tea acknowledging the contribution from local sponsors and supporters.

“We have our committed members and contributions from the wider community to thank for the success of our community garden,” Ms Pavitt said.

Sunshine Coast Council Manager, Parks and Gardens, Nicholas Coluccio said the region’s community gardens offered a unique space for people to connect with the environment and like-minded people.  

“Community gardens are the perfect place to learn more about sustainable living as well as providing a wider range of environmental, social and educational benefits,” Mr Coluccio said.

“Council acts as a key stakeholder in the regions community gardens providing advice and support on governance, structure and role responsibilities. Council officers will often facilitate workshops such as waste and recycling, plant education and more.”

Research confirms community gardens can play a significant role in enhancing the physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being necessary to build healthy and socially sustainable communities.
