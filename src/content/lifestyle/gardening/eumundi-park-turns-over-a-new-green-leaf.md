Allan Templeton Park in Eumundi has received an upgrade providing a fresh, new look for visitors.

Works started at the end of July giving the green heart a welcoming look.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was glad to see the ageing steel and timber shelter replaced.

“The shelter was well passed its use-by-date and we have also removed the shelter furniture and associated water tank,” Cr Law said.

“The dead tree behind the shelter and the timber bollards along the park access way have also been taken away.

“Council has installed a new picnic setting on the existing, refurbished concrete slab, which was pressure cleaned and modified in size.

“I think the new setting is more inviting and I hope families, friends and locals will get better use out of it.

“As the park name suggests, we have taken on former Maroochy Shire Councillor Allan Templeton’s green thumb approach by increasing the grassed area where items were removed and have planted new trees to help act as vehicle barriers.

“I’ve been told that it was Allan who put the green into Eumundi by planting shrubs and gardens down Eumundi’s Memorial Drive.

“Now the bustling town is bursting with shady nooks and green parks for generations to enjoy.

“It’s amazing to see how a small difference can go a long way, especially when you view the before and after pictures.

“I hope the community enjoys the new look as much as I do.”
