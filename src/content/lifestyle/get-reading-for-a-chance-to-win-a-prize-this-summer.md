Sunshine Coast Council Libraries’ annual Summer Reading Club is back this year.

From Wednesday December 1, children, teens and families are invited to register and read for the chance to win great prizes including book, game or toy vouchers.

Summer reading is a wonderful opportunity for young people to discover the joy of recreational reading, something that is also critical to helping them retain knowledge and skills learned during the school year.

The time young people spend choosing a book, reading graphic novels or listening to audiobooks at their local library is so valuable because it’s helping to expand their vocabulary, literacy development and opening up new worlds of characters and stories to discover.

It’s super easy to join:

Step 1. Visit the Sunshine Coast Libraries website ([library.sunshinecoastlqld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
)

Step 2: Go to the Summer Reading Club page in the What’s On section

Step 3: Register online

Step 4. Get reading!

Step 5. Uncover and discover more by registering on the Beanstack Summer Reading platform through the libraries website. Once registered you can complete activities and submit reviews of any great books you have read. There are prizes to be won including book, game or toy vouchers!

All Summer Reading Club entries close 5pm Monday January 31, 2021.

Winners will be announced Wednesday February 2, 2021. 

For more information and to register head to the Library [website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Summer-Reading-Club-2021)
