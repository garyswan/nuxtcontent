As the days get longer many residents will be getting out and about to enjoy the great outdoors using our Coastal Pathway and its access to the Sunshine Coast’s coastline.

The Coastal Pathway is unique to the Sunshine Coast and offers residents a safe, off-road, connected pathway from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

Sunshine Coast Council will run ‘pop up’ stalls along the pathway during November and December to showcase pathway features and share tips to ensure everyone enjoys their coastal pathway experience.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Coastal Pathway was a terrific recreational asset for locals and visitors and also served a valuable transport function.

“We have some of the most scenic coastline in Queensland right on our doorstep, and the Coastal Pathway provides free and easy access for all,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“With many people using the pathway, it’s vital that we’re considerate of others while we’re out and about.”

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the Coastal Pathway would also be showcased to local, domestic and overseas audiences with the release of a video series on council’s YouTube channel showing the beauty and diversity of the pathway.

“Locals, visitors and potential visitors can take in the scenery, enjoying the view from various locations along the way and planning where they’d like to take their next ride,” Cr Cox said.

The videos feature the full length of the Coastal Pathway in easy to watch segments will be available on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
&#x20;by searching ‘[Coastal Pathway](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
’ or on council’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN6q_1UaRZU5Lu_wqC_e6vNmZYGox9Y0-)
.

The Coastal Pathway-showcasing initiative is proudly supported by the Queensland Government’s Cycle Network Local Government Grants program.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said investing in bike-riding projects delivered positive benefits for local communities.

“We know that, on average, every dollar we invest in bike-riding infrastructure will return nearly five dollars in economic benefit to Queensland with improved health outcomes, reduced traffic congestion and lower transport costs.

"That’s why the Queensland Government has committed $252 million in funding over the next four years to support and encourage bike riding across the state, including projects across the Coastal Pathway, to improve facilities for locals and tourists alike.

“Investments like this will help get more people riding more often around the Sunshine Coast community."

Council reminds everyone to share the path when out and about. All users should have respect for others and slow down, keep left, pass on the right, and don’t block the pathway for others.
