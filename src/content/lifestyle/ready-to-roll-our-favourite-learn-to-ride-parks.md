Learning to ride a bike or scooter creates an amazing sense of achievement for young ones and our region has a great range of family friendly parks to get them started.

Sunshine Coast educational bike tracks offer a fun way for kids to gain key skills and build confidence on two wheels.

We’ve compiled a list of some of the region’s favourite learn-to-ride parks:

## Skippy Park, Landborough

![](https://preview-assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c631baf8-1b46-001f-580c-d0001b68b4a8/eafd4e41-b85f-414d-bd99-d14b87921f91/PXL_20220331_065543016-012-1-1024x771.jpeg)

The ideal park for kids to gain confidence on the purpose-built cycle circuit for both beginners and experienced cyclists positioned around a wonderful playground.

This is a great place for beginners to learn to cycle or ride a scooter on an even bitumen path around a green oval and playground area set against a backdrop of native bush.

Experienced cyclists will also enjoy this circuit for honing their skills and speed on the curves.

Once the kids have had enough of cycling, they can play ball on the oval or head to playground.

As you might well expect, the park was named after kangaroos that regularly visit the area.

**Amenities:** picnic tables, barbecues, drinking fountain and toilets.\
