A special morning tea event at Sunshine Coast Council’s Nambour and Heritage Library today (November 23) celebrated the venue’s contemporary and vibrant new look.

Division 10 and Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Nambour and Heritage Libraries formed an integral part of our hinterland community, with more than 87,000 people coming through their doors during the past 12 months.

“There has been a library, of some form, in the main street of Nambour since 1913 – that’s 108 years that our local community has been coming together to feed their love of reading, and make valuable connections with others,” Cr Law said.

“The Nambour Library where it stands today, was opened in 1986 and throughout the past 37 years has been extending outwards and upwards to continue accommodating our growing community.

“It has grown to be one of the largest branches in our Sunshine Coast Library network, welcoming 1142 new members during the 2021/2020 financial year – contributing to Nambour’s total of 11,411 members.

“The recent refurbishment includes a number of striking wall murals, and ties together other library improvements, such as new furniture, shelving and layout modifications, that were completed in June 2021.

“We’ve also increased BYO device spaces, which includes tables with built in USB points and power points so you’ll never run out of battery.

“The new layout maximises space, functionality and flow throughout the Nambour library, and is designed to draw people in and encourage you to explore the collections.

“These upgrades celebrate our local landscape and hinterland lifestyle, through the colour scheme, and local imagery. 

“I’m really pleased to say some of our captivating heritage images from the Picture Sunshine Coast catalogue are now showcased on the walls within the library.

“Picture Sunshine Coast is a fantastic resource, which our dedicated staff are continually adding to, and one that should be cherished.

“The Picture Sunshine Coast catalogue, which now contains more than 10,000 images, was started following the amalgamation of the Maroochy, Noosa and Caloundra City council’s in March 2008.

“And, our Heritage Library made its home here in Nambour 2016. It is a critical asset to our community – collecting and preserving valuable historic images and artefacts from across the Sunshine Coast for future generations to enjoy. 

“Sunshine Coast Council’s Libraries are places of imagination, growth and learning – and we hope that this refurbishment will provide customers with a renewed sense of inspiration.

“Through the Sunshine Coast Community Strategy council wants to see a strong community that is connected, engaged and inclusive – a place where we can thrive together. Our Sunshine Coast Libraries tick those boxes.

“The Nambour and Heritage Library upgrades demonstrate council’s continued commitment to investing in library operations – and infrastructure – to ensure they remain relevant and responsive to new and existing audiences.”
