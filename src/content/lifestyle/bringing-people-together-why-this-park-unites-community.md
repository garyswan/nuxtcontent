A popular Sunshine Coast park is ready to be enjoyed over the busy holiday period after the completion of a series of exciting enhancements.

Beerwah’s Turner Park has received many new trimmings, including new shade sails, pathway improvements, and lighting upgrades.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said he was thrilled to see how the vital community facility had evolved.

“Beerwah is the civic heart of our country townships and features the remarkable backdrop of the Glass House Mountains,” Cr Baberowski said.

“People from near and far converge at Turner Park.

“Perhaps this is because of its wonderful wetlands, lake, and adjacent \_Heart\_ precinct, which is becoming an incredible meeting and event space for our local communities.

“When works began on the Turner Park Master Plan in 2015, the goal was to support and increase the profile of Beerwah as a stronger destination, by highlighting the town’s layers of history and rural character.

“We started by increasing the open space to allow for a new entry off Turner Street with a local stonework plaza and arbour, custom-design seating walls, park furniture and expanded gardens.

“This really helped improve the connectivity between the parkland and our town centre.

“We then worked with members of the old Beerwah-Peachester RSL Club to upgrade and relocate the sandstone cenotaph into a new Garden of Remembrance setting and it now has a proud new home in Turner Park.

“The revitalised precinct is proving to be a wonderful community meeting place – bringing people together in what is now a vibrant, shaded and attractive country town.’’

Cr Baberowski said the addition of an extraordinary multi-level children’s playground had really helped transform the park into an exciting family destination.

“Families from across the region now travel to Beerwah to experience the Turner Park playground, with its impressive climbing tower, spiral slide, flying fox, and lots more for little ones of all ages,’’ he said.

“I’m grateful to the Queensland Government for the recent investment into Beerwah through the South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.  

“This extra funding has enabled us to provide improved pathways, electrical upgrades, renewed park furniture, and landscaping for Turner Park this year,” Cr Baberowski said.

Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the Palaszczuk Government was delivering for the Sunshine Coast.

“Investments in our public spaces like Turner Park further enhance our wonderful lifestyle here on the coast,” Mr Hunt said.

“These upgrades will deliver an even better community park, bringing more locals and tourists to enjoy it.”

Council is now preparing to bring a unique art installation to life at Turner Park, to be unveiled next year, with several local artists shortlisted for the opportunity.

“There’s so much more to discover in our fabulous country towns,” Cr Baberowski said. 

“We are a friendly lot, so I know you will receive a warm welcome.

“Come and connect with nature, relax, walk or play with family and friends in the civic heart of the Glass House country townships.”
