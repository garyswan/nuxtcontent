Serenity Bridge has now reopened, so everyone can enjoy the picturesque waterfalls and cool cascades from above, while nestled in a hidden tropical oasis less than a kilometre from Buderim Village.

**SUITABILITY**\
This stunning walk is suitable for all fitness levels. 

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Buderim Forest Park is a 45 hectare rainforest haven tucked into the heart of Buderim – both geographically and sentimentally.

The Forest Loop Circuit – described by one reviewer as “a truly gorgeous, natural experience” – is from the upper entry point (which is closest to the waterfalls) via Quorn Close.

The relatively steep sloping track will lead you to the high arching Serenity Bridge, spanning across the falls and creek.

With the completion strengthening works to Serenity Bridge, you can take your time while crossing over to admire the falls and bubbling crystal cascades, capture an image of the lush surrounds of the rainforest and enjoy the sounds of nature.

You will quickly understand where the bridge got its name from.

The water hole is particularly spectacular after significant rainfall!

You can continue on from the Forest Circuit Loop, joining the River Walk which includes a 700m elevated wooden section of boardwalk and short trail.

The entire loop, taking time to stop, photograph and soak up the surrounds is approximately 45 minutes.

**AFTERWARDS**\
There are picnic grounds, BBQ facilities and tables available at both ends of the reserve.

From the top end, Buderim township is less than 1 km away with an array of cafes. At the bottom end is Harry’s Restaurant which overlooks a large open reserve.

Please preserve the area’s beauty and take your rubbish with you.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The upper entry point is via Quorn Close, which runs off Lindsay Road at the top of Buderim. This takes you directly on to the Forest Loop Circuit. At Serenity Bridge you can join the lower track if you like. There is ample parking at this entry point.
