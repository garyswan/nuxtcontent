While popular with locals, this stunning conservation park circuit, taking in the shoreline of Currimundi Lake, the ocean and coastal bushland is largely unknown to those from further afield.

**SUITABILITY**

Easy grade, flat trail - perfect for a family walk or solo trail run.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

Named after a local conservationist and botanical artist – and one of four founding members of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland in 1962 – Kathleen McArthur Conservation Park is a small parcel of wallum heath between the lake and the sea. The bright heath wildflowers that bloom in late winter and spring were widely featured in her illustrations and books.

Look for white tea tree, orange and yellow banksias and other small flowers – and the birds that come to drink their nectar.

The marked trail is a short sandy single track that winds through beautiful coastal heath. It offers glimpses of Currimundi Lake before bringing you out on the beach. To make a loop look for the northern beach access and after a brief paved stretch it’s back into the bush. Brilliant!

**AFTERWARDS**\
Do the Currimundi Lake "Loop the Lake" Walk which goes along both sides of the lake, crossing over via the bridge. Swimming is also popular in the lake’s end if you can brave the winter cold.

And why not enjoy a pit stop at one of the coffee shops and eateries at Currimundi.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Head to Wurtulla on Nicklin Way. At the IGA intersection turn into Anuna Street towards the coast. Turn left into Mandara Drive and the first right into Bareki Street. Follow this road to the end where it joins Coongarra Esplanade and look for a car park here. The walk starts here in the park.
