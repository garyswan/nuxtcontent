A delightful 1.5km walk through dense, cool rainforest in the lower section of this 45 hectare reserve on the northern side of Buderim.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for all ages. Prams and wheelchair accessible.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is a breathtaking, very accessible adventure the whole family can enjoy.\
The boardwalk takes you on a journey through a lush, dense rainforest of ferns, trees, vines forest, crisscrossing Martins Creek at several spots.

The sounds of the tinkling creek and the birds singing will instantly calm the mind.\
There are also picnic grounds, BBQ facilities and tables available.

**AFTERWARDS**\
For the more energetic, the river walk track links (via a rough trail) into the Buderim Forest Falls, which is a truly gorgeous, natural experience.

Please note, at this time, the Serenity Bridge is closed for maintenance so you cannot use this to continue on to do the Forest Loop circuit. Instead, simply retrace your steps back to your starting point where you can enjoy a feed at Harry’s Restaurant, or head over to the local shops out on Jones Road.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Make your way to Buderim as the walk is close by and only 5km from Maroochydore. There are two entry points to this reserve, both off Lindsay Road.\
The River Walk is the lower entry and is located off Harry’s Lane which is off Lindsay Road (off the lower end of Jones Road).
