If there’s a break in the wet conditions forecast today, this 4km path linking Mudjimba Beach to Marcoola Beach – a stunning section of the iconic Coastal Walk – is well worth checking out. As well as multiple opportunities to stop, rest and refresh along the way, it includes arguably the BEST views of Old Woman Island on the Sunshine Coast!

**SUITABLILITY**\
Suitable for older walkers or active families – younger children will need bikes or scooters if completing the full 4km (one-way).

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Sunrises and sunsets along this stretch of the coastline are beautiful, as views over Old Woman Island are spectacular.

Popular with surfers, this section is usually less crowded than Alexandra Headland and Noosa.

On Saturdays, Mudjimba Beach Surf Life Saving Club and park area is the starting point for Park Run members so avoid the early morning congestion between 6:30am – 7:30am.

Enjoy the beautiful swarms of butterflies that harbour in the trees along the pathway during the autumn months.

Both Mudjimba Beach and Marcoola Beach have excellent park facilities for children to enjoy and amenities. Local shops at each location are perfect for refreshments or a coffee stop.

**AFTERWARDS**\
It’s coming to that time of year where you may be keen to take a dip in the ocean to cool off, especially deserved if you’ve done the path on foot.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Mudjimba Beach is easily accessible form David Low Way along Mudjimba Beach Road. There is plenty of parking along the esplanade or in the beachside park and Life Saving area. Alternatively, you can start the walk at Marcoola – parking on the esplanade here is ample.
