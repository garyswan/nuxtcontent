High intensity training circuit through stunning bushland, along flowing creek surrounded by a huge variety of local wildlife.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers, runners and riders of intermediate fitness levels.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Rocky Creek circuit is a 5.4km track through the Parklands Conservation Park, which provides a valuable wildlife habitat through pen eucalypt forest, rainforest gullies and gorges.

The circuit begins from the base of car park, so be sure to take some time to read the information board and familiarise yourself with the Rocky Creek circuit track! As noted on the board, the circuit is slippery when wet, and has sections with steep grades.

First up is an inclined track to the skills area, which is a purpose-built activity circuit for mountain bikers. As you pass the skills area, continue the journey up hill and follow the directional boards through the Rocky Creek circuit (get ready for the steep sections).

On the higher ridges, the grassy forest floor is characterised with tallowwood, bloodwood and casuarina. While the lower areas are typical of scribbly gum, bracken fern and palm groves.

The circuit will take you down to the creek (a nice rest spot), where you cross over a rocky section. Be careful this can be slippery after rainfall. (Some of the photos featured are after heavy rainfall, hence the puddles and higher water level in the creek.)

For more information visit the Dept. Of Environment Science.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Walkers, runners, horse riders and mountain-bike riders can explore the park on 15km of shared trails. Alternatively, head into Nambour and grab a coffee or meal from one of the many local establishments. Or head towards Yandina and make a stop at Wappa Dam and Falls!

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Take Nambour Connection Road/Parkland Exit 210 off the Bruce Highway and turn into Radar Hill Road. There is a car park with ample parking available.

\*Note there is no drinking water or amenities at this location.
