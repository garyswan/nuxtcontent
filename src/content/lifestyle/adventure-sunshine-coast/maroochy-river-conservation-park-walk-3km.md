A shaded walk through the marvellous Maroochy River Conservation Park from Twin Waters to Mudjimba Beach.

**SUITABLILITY**\
Suitable for all ages, including older walkers.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Leave the noise of the traffic behind and enjoy the melodies of the Eucalypt forest birds, as you take this shady alternative walk to Mudjimba Beach from Novotel Twin Waters Resort.

Enjoy the light that gently filters through the open canopy to the bracken ferns below. There are also many opportunities to photograph the abundant birdlife in the park.

A track winds through the woods with an alternative smaller circuit, that loops back to the main track and continues over timber boardwalks in the swampy sections of the trail. The entire path is flat but narrow in places with some fallen timbers to traverse.

There is a section of track that can become very boggy and impassable after decent rainfall, located approximately 120m from the exit on the Mudjimba Beach side of the park, but if your car is parked back on the Twin Waters side, the walk to this point is still worth the effort.

For a change of scenery on your way back to the car, take the cleared road that follows the creek. This path can be accessed easily from the Mudjimba side of the park and is less boggy. If you’re lucky, you may see some canoeists paddling along the canal at high tide. The exit from this point is a little further along Ocean Road where the canal stops at the roadside.

Be sure to take the mosquito repellent.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Mudjimba Esplanade, with its shops and playground is only 30m from the exit point on Cottonwood Street for refreshments, amenities, and a dip in the ocean. Twin Waters Village or the Novotel Resort also have coffee shops and restaurants.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The trail starts directly off Ocean Road opposite Novotel Twin Waters Resort. Limited parking is available at the side of the road. Alternatively, you can park at Mudjimba Beach Esplanade and head down Cottonwood Street. Access to the trail is clearly marked.
