This gorgeous hidden gem is the perfect opportunity to enjoy the flora and fauna of Buderim as you walk any of the four trails in the nine-hectare Foote Sanctuary on the eastern slopes.

**SUITABILITY**

Suitable for walkers of varying fitness levels as there are a choice of trails. People in wheelchairs or prams can enjoy the paved section of this loop. Dogs are allowed on leash.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

This reserve is rich in bird and plant life with a variety of walk options. At the Park Lane entrance, you will find a map of the walking paths, as well as information on how this Sanctuary was donated by a local farming family in honour of their son who was killed during WWI.

There’s also a stunning new timber stairway leading down from the carpark entrance to the picnic area.

Throughout the park are information signs identifying the various trees such as the pink bloodwood and Bunya pine and other woodland and eucalyptus species.

The most popular walk is the Botanic Track (608 m Easy to Moderate). This sealed loop path meanders through the rainforest with three bridge crossings over creeks. If you’re with littlies or oldies, this is the easiest little loop in this quiet reserve, with benches to sit and relax along the way. Approx 20 mins return.

Other walks in the Sanctuary include:

*   Cascade Circuit. (Moderate) A side circuit and steep descent off Botanic Track, to the flowing cascades. Approx 40 minutes.
*   Eucalyptus Track. (Moderate)
*   Boundary Track (Moderate - Difficult)

There are over 80 recorded species of birds in the Foote Sanctuary including Red chested King Parrot Male, Noisy Pittas, Fan Tails and Green Catbirds. Plus, you can often see swamp wallabies.

**AFTERWARDS**

Do one of the sidewalks – they are not too long – or relax in the park where there are picnic shelters, playground, BBQ, and toilet facilities. The Buderim township with its many cafes is also close by.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Make your way to the Buderim main shopping precinct (Main Street). Continue along Main Street (which turns in Kings Street) and continue through the roundabout towards Mooloolaba Road. Travel a short distance before turning left into Foote Avenue. Proceed through the first roundabout to Fountain Road and take the first left into Park Lane. Travel to the end of Park Lane and have reached the official Sanctuary entrance.

There is plenty of parking and facilities to enjoy – walk under the beautiful entrance archway and begin your journey!
