A beautiful, easy walk through the lower section of a varied rainforest, with butterflies and birds on show.

### Suitability

Suitable for walkers – a short, easy route, but being a bush path is not suitable for wheelchairs.

### Highlights

Kawana Forest is a large conservation reserve in Meridan Plains that lies to the west of Kawana Way.

The Kawana Forest Walking Trail is a short walk that loops into remnant paperbark and eucalypt forest – part of what is called a littoral (threatened) rainforest on Australia’s east coast.

The trail itself is 957m long and full of variety. You’ll see white trunks of towering gums, vibrant green fan palms, vines, orchids, ferns and figs. Also calling this area home are many different butterfly species, along with Pale-headed Rosellas, Brown Cuckoo-Doves and Scarlet Honeyeaters.

The trail re-joins the path a little further along from the start. Follow the paved path back to the start point.

Of note, the eastern section stays flooded /wet for some time if it's rained recently, with mosquitos being prevalent.

### Afterwards

You can extend the walk by taking the pathway east to Kawana Wetlands.

### How to get there

Head to Woodlands Blvd off Kawana Way Link Road. Turn right at the roundabout into White Cedar Drive and look to park near the park that adjoins Lacebark St or Lillypilly Ct. Alternatively, you can access this walk from the end of nearby Tulipwood Ct, where there is signage.
