A coastal path that starts in the bushland at the end of Dicky Beach and takes you through a shaded pathway to the eastern end of Currimundi Lake.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers, runners and recreational cyclists and is an easy grade.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is an easy 1.7-kilometre one-way walk or cycle that is suitable for the whole family.

Walkers have the option to walk along the path through beautiful coastal bushland, with pockets of views onto the local beaches. Otherwise, head down onto the beach, and enjoy a swim along the way!

The path option will take you across the picturesque Coondibah Creek bridge, with expansive views over the creek (beautiful any time of day).

Once you reach Currimundi Lake you won’t want to leave in a hurry. The calm waters and endless sand make it an aquatic playground for the whole family.

This largely shaded section of the coastal pathway is a great option for hotter days.

**TAKE CARE**\
Bikes on pathway can come through quite quickly so dogs must be on leash for everyone's safety. Give dogs free time at Coondibah Creek, half-way through the walk where the bridge crosses the creek.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Be sure spend some time enjoying the stunning surrounds in Cliff Hargreaves Park. This popular park overlooks Currimundi Lake and has a playground, barbecue and picnic tables, natural shade, beach showers as well as public amenities. Alternatively, you can purchase food and drinks from the beach front cafes.

Feeling energetic, continue north along the coastal pathway to Warana!

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Park your car at Dicky Beach and then head towards the surf club and you’ll see the pathway continue past the club.
