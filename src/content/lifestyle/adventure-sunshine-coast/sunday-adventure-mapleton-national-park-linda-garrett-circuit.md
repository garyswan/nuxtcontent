Enjoy a small 1km section of stunning Mapleton National Park with all the family or go solo and use the opportunity to reinvigorate yourself with the sights and sounds of nature.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers of all ages as it’s a short, pleasant, easy walk and links into a number of other gorgeous trails for those wanting to extend the adventure.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This section of Mapleton Park is named after its benefactor Linda Garrett, who donated the $500,000 parcel of land for conservation.

At the start of the walk is a large information board and shelter marking the starting point of many walks, including a section of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland Great Walk.

This short circuit leads through rainforest, a Piccabeen Palm grove, and a tall wet Eucalypt forest featuring blackbutt, brushbox, turpentine and flooded gum. There is a seat overlooking Gheerrulla Creek close to the halfway point with a pleasant outlook.

This small world heritage park protects a rainforest remnant on the Blackall Range and is home to the Great Barred Frog. On this walk you may also hear and see the Bell Birds!

If you want to, make your walk longer by following the Great Walk signage for some distance, or simply return to the starting point.

**AFTERWARDS**\
There are several other walks to enjoy nearby at the Mapleton Day Use Area including Piccabeen Circuit (6.7km) and the Kureelpa Falls Circuit (8.5km). Be sure to jump onto the Adventure Sunshine Coast [website](https://adventure.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;for more details of what they offer.

Otherwise, head back into Mapleton and support one of the local establishments. Why not grab a coffee and take a walk around the beautiful lily ponds? The lily ponds are surrounded by serene parkland, in the centre of the village.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Head to Mapleton and take the Obi Obi Road out of town and take the first right onto Delicia Road. After about 2kms you will come to the Mapleton National Park on your right. The walk’s entrance is on the right, just after the Mapleton Recycle Centre.
