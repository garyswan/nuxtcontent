Enjoy a more challenging - but absolutely stunning - part of the Sunshine Coastal Pathway as it winds above cliffs and round Caloundra Head.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers, runners and recreational cyclists.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is a 3 km kilometre one-way walk or cycle around cliff tops and along Caloundra’s popular Shelley Beach. This section of the coastal pathway represents a more challenging adventure, as it adapts to the different cliffs heights, making it ideal for fit training.

Walk, jog or ride along the shoreline, pausing at times to enjoy the views. Behind you to the north is Mt Coolum in the distance. At all times the ocean is close, as are the trees – she-oaks and Norfolk Pines.

At most times of the day you can count on an ocean breeze and there are plenty of places to stop and rest, such as Shelly Beach located half-way. There you will find public toilets, sheltered picnic areas and, on weekends, a coffee van.

As you round Wickham Point (Caloundra Head), you’ll enjoy expansive views south to Bribie Island and the Glass House Mountains.

**AFTERWARDS**\
The Moffat to Kings Beach journey is part of Caloundra’s Coastal Pathway, a breathtaking nine-kilometre stretch of paths, meandering along Caloundra’s beaches from Bells Creek in the south to Point Cartwright in the north. There’s more to explore in both directions and – as in any Sunshine Coast seaside destination – cafes, eateries and picnic places abound.

\*\*HOW TO GET THERE\
\*\*To the starting point: Head towards Moffat Beach and find a car park near the start, which is in Eleanor Shipley Park, near Bryce Street (closest corner is Seaview Terrace).

To the end point: The walks ends at Caloundra Surf Life Saving Club / Kings Beach Park at the Northern end of Kings Beach. To get back to your vehicle it's more enjoyable to return via the coast, however you could get there faster by walking down Edmund St. Buses also run along this route.
