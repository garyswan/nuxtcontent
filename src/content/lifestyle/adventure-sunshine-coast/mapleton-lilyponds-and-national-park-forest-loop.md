A serene park and pond, full of water lilies, in the centre of this gorgeous little town.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for all ages and families.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This parkland has a country feel, located in the heart of Mapleton.

The lilyponds and surrounding landscape offer a tranquil experience, with beautiful gardens and natural shade.

The lilyponds are circled by a paved 500m walking path, perfect for a morning or afternoon stroll.

The extensive parkland includes wide open spaces, seating areas, a gazebo, barbecue facilities, outdoor gym equipment and a playground.

The parkland also houses the Mapleton Skate Park, incorporating a balanced mix of ramp and street elements, which is ideal for beginners and intermediates.

With so much space and facilities on offer, this is an ideal place for the next family catch up!

**AFTERWARDS**\
Take a short stroll into town and enjoy this quaint hinterland village, or for adventure lovers, there are many walks to enjoy in this area including Piccabeen Circuit (6.7km) and the Kureelpa Falls Circuit (8.5km) at the nearby Mapleton Day Use Area.

While you're in the region admiring parks and ponds, pop by the Maleny Botanic Gardens and Bird World, three hectares of beautiful, privately-owned gardens, with Glass House Mountains and coastal views and a café.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Head to Mapleton at the northern end of the Blackall range, accessible via the Nambour Mapleton Road or the Montville Mapleton Road. From Mapleton township take the Obi Obi Road and turn right into Delicia Road and then turn right almost straight away into the Mapleton Lilyponds carpark.
