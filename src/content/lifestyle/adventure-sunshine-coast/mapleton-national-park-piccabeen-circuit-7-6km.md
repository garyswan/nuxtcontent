A shady, peaceful trail through lush green Piccabeen palms, tall Blackbutt trees, rainforest and high-range creek beds with stepping stones.

**SUITABILITY**\
This is a shared path for walkers, runners, horse riders and mountain bikers. (At the starting point there are dedicated parks for horse floats.)

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Mapleton National Park is a dream setting for nature lovers and adventurers, and this circuit does not disappoint. Described as a beautiful, well-cared-for, even and quiet track, that is very easy to follow due to clear signs at each junction.  

Along the way you’ll get to enjoy some creek crossings – wet after the rain – and you might hear one of the 32 different species of frogs that live in the park! Plus, there is the abundant bird life. Keep your eye out for the Australasian figbird, which can often be seen feeding on the red dangling piccabeen seeds.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Why not head back to the Day Use Area, enjoy a relaxed lunch then head off on the Kureelpa Falls Circuit (which we can’t help but feature in some of the photos). See boulders, cascading waters, large lizards – the list goes on.  

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
From Mapleton township take the Obi Obi Road and turn right into Delicia Road. Shortly thereafter turn right into Mapleton Forest Road, which is a dirt road but generally ok for 2WD vehicles.. Follow this road for about 2 km and you will come to Lookout Road on your left and then the Mapleton Day Use area, set amongst towering blackbutts. The Piccabeen Circuit starts from here, near the Leafy Lane Trail Head.
