Active fun for all the family to kick-off the school holidays – an easy 4.2km walk that connects the Bells Reach community and visitors to the different levels of playgrounds and a café to rest up or watch the kids play.

**SUITABILITY**\
Perfect for walking, jogging, prams and bicycles. Dogs-on-leash allowed. 60mins walking pace return.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Start out at the path along Active Park – a great space for all ages with plenty of room to kick a ball and a younger children’s playground, plus outdoor exercise equipment.

The path begins to loop around the park where you can show the kids the community herb garden.

Continuing along the path, be sure to pay close attention when crossing the road that links the paths, especially along Indigo Road and Bell Vista Blvd.

The journey will take you around to Quinn Park, with a larger playground which has lots of climbing and rope activities as well a cafe where you can take your dog.

Continue south past the entrance to Arbour Estate and follow the path around to a right bend where you follow along the edge of a nature reserve.

You will connect up with a smaller playground which features a flying fox swing and another spot to relax with the family, plenty of drinking fountains, tables and shade sails.

The journey loops back past the café and will soon return you to your starting point.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The best place to park is at the parking bays on your left on Indigo Road. The path starts just metres from there.
