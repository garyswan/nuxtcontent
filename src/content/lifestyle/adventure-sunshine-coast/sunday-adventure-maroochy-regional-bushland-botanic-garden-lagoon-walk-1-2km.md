The stunning Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden, including the Arts and Ecology Centre, is set amongst 82 hectares of eucalypt and riparian forest, with creeks, lagoons and walking tracks. Truly a must-see for all ages and abilities.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers out to see a range of native bush in a small area with great supporting facilities and information. Great place to take young kids for an exploration of the natural world.

**LAGOON WALK HIGHLIGHTS**\
This popular natural terrain bush track follows the banks of the lagoon. The open forest ecosystem has remnant Bloodwood, Blue Gum and Tallowwood in the canopy while Piccabeen Palm and Tree Fern fringe the rocky gullies and bridges along the track.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Spend time enjoying the beauty and botanical heritage of the gardens. The gardens include a variety of attractions along the walks, that can be enjoyed by visitors of all ages. Art exhibitions, educational workshops and events are held in the garden and the purpose-built Arts and Ecology Centre throughout the year.

Grab a coffee or bite to eat at the café, or BYO picnic and enjoy one of the many fabulous spots to have lunch!
