Want a change of scenery for a fun Father’s Day adventure, but don’t want to travel too far afield and keen to avoid the crowds? Check out this 7.6km return (3.8km one-way) part elevated boardwalk/ part unsealed road/ part grassy track through wetlands and open areas – right here in Kawana!

**SUITABILITY**

Suitable for walkers, runners and recreational cyclists and is accessible for wheelchairs for some distance.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

Kawana Forest is a large conservation reserve on the western side of Kawana Way.

The extensive elevated walkway meanders by a bend in the river before it shares an unsealed road and passes through a more open area which is eventually stopped by a fence and gate. At this point the track veers to the left and follows the fence line on the right before arriving at the Kawana Forest suburb a few hundred metres later.

This grassy part of the walk can be boggy in places after rain, but certainly not insurmountable – walk on the grass at the very edge.

If you walk or cycle quietly and don’t startle the birdlife you may spot Royal Spoonbills, purple Swamphens and Great Egrets. You could also come across kangaroos, skinks, lizards, butterflies and dragonflies as well as a variety of small crabs including the red-fingered marsh crab.

At this end of the walk, you can turn left on the path to join the Kawana Forest Nature Walk or return back the way you came.

**AFTERWARDS**

The nearby Homemaker Centre offers all amenities – toilets, cafes and other distractions for entertaining and celebrating dad this Father’s Day.

There are also more walks to be had along the river just north of here, access from Technology Drive.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

From Kawana Way, turn into Premier Circuit and then turn left. Follow the circuit around and take the first left (Milieu Pl) - this brings you to the Kawana Football Club and the Information Board regarding the walk is clearly visible.

Oh yes, don’t forget the insect repellent!
