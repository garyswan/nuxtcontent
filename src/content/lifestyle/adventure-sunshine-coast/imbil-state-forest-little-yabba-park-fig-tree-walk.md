A surprising gem tucked just off the highway with both forest and creek views.

SUITABILITY\
Suitable for all age groups and abilities. The Fig Tree component of the walk is wheelchair accessible.

HIGHLIGHTS\
Just south of Kenilworth, Little Yabba Park straddles both sides of Maleny Kenilworth Road with an underpass connecting them so there’s no need to cross the highway.

The Sunshine Coast Hinterland Poetry Trail has a spectacular ‘Buttress Root’ sculpture located in the park which is worth a look. Take a moment to read the beautiful poetry inscribed on the surface while listening to the creek ramble over rocks and the birds sing in the trees of this lush, green park.

Amenities and a picnic area are available and access to Little Yabba Creek can be found along sections of the bank.

A short walk across the bridge takes you to Fig Tree Walk, a wheelchair accessible, 1km circuit through the rainforest. In here you’ll find all manner of forest wildlife and an impressive number of Fig Trees with enormous buttress roots securing them to the forest floor.

AFTERWARDS\
Head into Kenilworth and sample some of the local cheese or a famous donut from the bakery. This quaint, hinterland town is worth taking a stroll around too as there are many gift shops and cafes to spend some time in.

HOW TO GET THERE\
Take the Bruce Highway and turn off onto the Eumundi Kenilworth Road. Follow the signs to Kenilworth and drive through the town for 6km towards Cambroon on the Maleny Kenilworth Road to Little Yabba Park. Parking is available on either side of the road.
