Check out the Pump Track, open now at Sugar Bag Road Mountain Bike Trails!

Grab your bike and helmet and give it a go. It’s easy and fun for all ages.

Designed to be raced head to head, pumping is riding without pedalling.

You generate momentum by up and down body movements, instead of pedalling or pushing.

**HOW TO PUMP**

*   Pull and push with arms and legs
*   Start slowly and increase your speed
