Discover stunning Lake Baroon (aka Baroon Pocket Dam), tucked away in the Obi Obi Valley, between Maleny and Montville in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland.

**SUITABILITY**\
A mostly grassy trail suitable for walkers, recreational cyclists and mountain bikers.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Accessible from 5:30am to 5:30pm seven days, this is a great little mowed lawn loop from the park.

The circuit is named after the first ranger of Lake Baroon, Martin Williams.

If you have a mountain bike, go clockwise around for the sweet swooping top section. There is no view at the top, but the lakeside section is picturesque.

There’s a shortcut halfway along if you want to miss the slightly hillier section.

Along the track, you will see many bird and possum nesting boxes high in the trees, which include Hoop and Bunya Pines.

In warmer weather, don’t forget to bring your swimmers, and if you have a paddlecraft – yes the lake is awesome for that too!

Note the grass can be slippery when wet.

**AFTERWARDS**\
The large open park has picnic shelters, BBQs, a big playground, natural history panel, and is perfect for swimming (in summer) and fishing. There are other walks to be enjoyed on the northern side of Lake Baroon including part of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland Great Walk.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
From downtown Maleny take Teak St out of town which turns into North Maleny Road. Stay on this road. It eventually turns into Baroon Pocket Road (after Eden Road). Follow the road to the very end down to the dam’s edge.

The short loop track starts and ends here at the lake’s southern recreation area.
