This 2.4km walk, waterfall and rock pools are iconic and a must for anyone living on or visiting the Sunshine Coast.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers with reasonable fitness as there are over 300 steps down to the falls.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Kondalilla National Park is a cool and very popular mountain retreat nearly all year round. The park is named after the spectacular Kondalilla Falls, where Skene Creek drops 90m into a rainforest valley. Kondalilla, an Aboriginal word meaning 'rushing waters', describes this park's waterfall during the summer wet season.

The Kondalilla Falls walk is part of the first section of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland Great Walk. The pathway is beautifully built for an accessible yet exciting experience. The manicured path means you can really enjoy the surrounding scenery on this short walk without watching your feet, and be mesmerised by the sound of the creek and birdlife in the virgin forest.

There are high and low paths that make a loop called Picnic Creek Circuit, with a diversion to the 100m high falls and swimming hole below (bring your togs). The water is cold, invigorating and inviting.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Enjoy a picnic or barbecue lunch in the park above the falls. Alternatively, the bustling tourist town of Montville is but a minute’s drive away for sweet treats and souvenirs.

\*\*HOW TO GET THERE\
\*\*Travel north on Main Street from Montville for about 2.6km. Turn left onto Kondalilla Falls Rd and travel another 700m to the park entrance.
