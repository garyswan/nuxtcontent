This gorgeous little hidden gem is a surprisingly quiet and varied bushland reserve just metres from the surf at Alexandra Beach.

**SUITABILITY**\
The trail is suitable for walkers – it is gravel/dirt, rises gently and has some well-spaced steps so it is not suitable for wheelchairs or prams. Dogs are permitted on a leash.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Tucked away 250m from the beach and busy Aerodrome Road, this small area provides a cool walking track through 5.7 hectares of revegetated forest, offering 1.5km of trails.

There is a great diversity of habitat, including Wet Eucalypt, open forest, and Lowland Rainforest, featuring Flooded Gum, Bushbox and Tallowood, as well as Cabbage and Palm Trees.

The Reserve is an important suburban wildlife preserve for Ringtail Possums and Microbats, as well as a home to bush Turkeys.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Enjoy strolling through nearby Nelson Park and the Alex Community Garden or walk back down the road to the beach and enjoy a cool drink at one of the coffee shops or restaurants.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Access is from Alexandra Parade, turning east into Mari Street near the Alex Surf Club. The start of the walk is at the top of Mari Street before turning right to a gated community and is clearly signposted. Parking is on-street. Access is also available from Tranquil Place or Woyin.
