You may have climbed up these amazing mountains, but have you ever been around them? 

**SUITABILITY**\
This 5.7km circuit is suitable for walkers, not much elevation, only distance where you’ll experience must-see views of the gorgeous Glasshouse Mountains National Park.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
The circuit gets its name from Trachyte Ridge and the type of rock which forms the volcanic peaks of the Glass House Mountains.

A firm favourite for the variety, and also the 100m stretch to the Jack Ferris Lookout on Trachyte Ridge, which provides an awesome angle to see Tibrogargan’s head along with views of other mountains.

The circuit leads through countryside linking Mount Tibrogargan and Mount Tibberoowuccum. The loop complements Tibrogargan’s base circuit and crosses several landscapes, from pine forestry to riparian rainforest, open woodland, and heathland. Watch for Grey Fantails and Red-browed Finches.

Recently the carpark has been upgraded with great facilities and interpretive materials.

It is also easily possible to shortcut to just the lookout from Caves Road, a dirt road that is generally navigable by 2WD if its dry.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Enjoy a picnic in the presence of these solemn mountains.

You might like to add onto this walk by doing the 3km circuit loop around the base of Mount Tibrogargan. Or you can head to the information centre in the town of Glass House Mountains where there are facilities in the park and eating places in town.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Mount Tibrogargan is located between Beerburrum and Glass House Mountains townships, off Marshs and Barrs Roads. Head to the township of Glass House Mountains off Steve Irwin Way (off M1). Continue driving south and turn right into into Barrs Road, which meets the car park entrance at Marshs Road (opposite a dragon fruit farm).

Driving from the south, take the Beerburrum Road off Steve Irwin Way, turn right into Beerburrum Woodford Road and right into Old Gympie Road. Turn right into Marshs Road and the car park will be about 1km along this road on your right. The walk starts from the car park.
