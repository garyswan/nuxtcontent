A beautifully maintained park and purpose-built cycle circuit for both beginners and experienced cyclists around a fabulous play area – perfect for school holiday fun!

\*\*SUITABILITY\
\*\*Suitable for riders of all abilities.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is a great place for beginners to learn to cycle or ride a scooter on an even bitumen path around a green oval and playground area set against a backdrop of native bush.

Experienced cyclists will also enjoy this circuit for honing their skills and speed on the curves.

Once your kids have had enough of cycling they can play ball on the oval or head to the playground.

It’s a wonderful facility in a natural setting of shrubs, bridges and sandstone blocks. There’s a flying fox and slippery slide that offers various ascent routes as well as a wooden xylophone, adventure sandpit and large climbing frame. This impressive playground was the site of the launch of Nature Play Queensland a few years back.

Skippy Park has shaded gazebos that are ideal for birthday parties and family gatherings. The amenities include electric BBQs, drinking taps and clean toilets on site.

Dogs are also allowed on leash on the track, however not within the playground.

As you might well expect, the park was named after kangaroos that regularly visit the area.

**AFTERWARDS**\
If you would like to do another flat easy ride, there is the old North Coast Road at Beerburrum on the east of the rail line that goes all the way to Glass House Mountains township. But if coffee or refreshments is more your style, Landsborough offers plenty of choice.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Skippy Park is located just south of Landsborough township and north of Beerwah. From Landsborough take the old Landsborough Road south of and after approx. 2 km along on your right you will pass Plover Drive. The turn off to Skippy Park Criterium is just past here on your right (before Thompson Road). If you are heading north on Old Landsborough Road from Beerwah, turn left after Thompson Road.
