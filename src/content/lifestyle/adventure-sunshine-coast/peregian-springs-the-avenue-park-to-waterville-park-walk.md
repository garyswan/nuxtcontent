For a bit of a change from the hinterland or the coastline trails we’ve highlighted lately… why not try this easy 1.2km walk (circuit) amongst beautiful parklands along the fringe of gorgeous Peregian Springs?

SUITABILITY\
This walk is perfect for families including toddlers in prams.

HIGHLIGHTS\
The Avenue Park is a great spot to begin this walk and features a range of amenities including toilets, BBQ facilities and drinking water.

Pack a picnic and let the kids run around the open green spaces or test their skills on the updated playground equipment.

The park also features a range of beautiful birdlife amongst the water lily covered pond. Several bridges complete the path surrounding the duck pond.

If you have brought your four-legged friend along, there is also a dog park directly across the road.

The walk takes you along the fringe of Peregian Springs, past another lake and the Waterville Way Park is the turning point. This quiet suburban green wedge includes picnic benches or plenty of green, shaded spaces to relax prior to the return leg.

AFTERWARDS\
Afterwards, Peregian Springs Shopping Centre is perfect to swing by for a post walk coffee or bite to eat at one of the many cafes or restaurants or if you are keen on going for a dip in the ocean, Peregian Beach and Coolum Beach are close-by.

HOW TO GET THERE\
When arriving via Emu Mountain Rd or Sunshine Coast Motorway, take the Peregian Springs Drv turnoff. Then turn left at The Avenue – the starting point is approximately 1km on your right.
