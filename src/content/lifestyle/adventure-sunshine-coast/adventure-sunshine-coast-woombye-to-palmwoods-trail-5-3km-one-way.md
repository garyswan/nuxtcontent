This is a little gem connecting hinterland townships, providing a fun adventure for riders and walkers of intermediate fitness levels.

**SUITABILITY**\
A 5.3km ride, walk or run from Woombye to Palmwoods town centres – it's rated as an easy, safe and sealed track.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is a popular recreational trail for many locals. The hilly hinterland stretch makes this a perfect workout for those wishing to increase their fitness levels or maximise their time exercising.

The journey begins and ends in the heart of both towns, providing ample parking, and access to amenities, water and shade.

Don’t forget to take in the views of the Blackall Range, which is particularly beautiful late afternoon as the sun is setting.

For those who wish to extend the journey, continue following the pathways through Palmwoods and around the township.

\*N.B - It's a good idea to print the map: [Map for Woombye to Palmwoods trail](https://bit.ly/3yA9E3B)
&#x20;or have it available on your phone as this neighbourhood trail is not marked in the way a bush trail would be.
