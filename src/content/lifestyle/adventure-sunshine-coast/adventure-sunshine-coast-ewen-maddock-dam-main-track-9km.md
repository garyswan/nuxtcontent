A gorgeous and varied one-way-walk lakeside through a scenic landscape, starting from a recently upgraded recreation area.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers of all ages, horse riders and mountain bikers. Dogs also allowed on leash.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This is one for everyone’s bucket list. Called the Main Track, the multi-use trail goes from Maddock Park on the northern side of the lake to Gympie Street North, near Landsborough.

Maddock Park has only been reopened for a year since its extensive improvements including new shelters, a new vessel launch pad and wash bay facility, BBQ facilities and a playground.

This very scenic trail offers lots of photo opportunities along the lake’s edge, including distant Glass House Mountains, waterlilies and other aqua plants. You pass through tall stands of Eucalypts and other forest trees as well as groves of palms and paperbark trees in wetlands that are buzzing with vibrant blue and burnt red dragonflies.

The trail is enhanced by a variety of birdlife throughout: willy wagtails, finches, whip birds, parrots, kingfishers, grey herons, ducks and pukekos, even pelicans in the distance. Along the way, near the lakes edge, you'll pass a big burnt out stump, once a giant a tree.

An undulating path, Main Track borders some horse properties in parts. There are some occasional trip hazards and a few minor muddy sections, but by and large, it's a very straight forward and accessible path.

At times, parts of the Main Track may be closed due to undergoing revegetation or required repair work. You can take other trail options as you go, which link back up with the Main Track, such as the Walking Track, including the boardwalk, and Pink and Brown Loops, if you want to hug the lake the whole way. Note – these alternative trails may not allow bikes or horses.

**AFTERWARDS**\
The beauty of this trail is at the end you can easily follow the road into Landsborough, a short distance away. The first turn on your left will take you back into the main street to bakeries and CJs Patisseries. Nom nom!

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
To the starting point: Turn onto Mooloolah Connection Road from Steve Irwin Way. Follow this road approx 1.5 km until you get to an SEQ Water sign for Ewen Maddock Dam Maddock Park. Turn left and drive down this road till you get to the car park.

To the end point: The end point is the park gate entry at Gympie Street North. From the main shopping street in Landsborough (Cribb Street) head north and at the first T-junction you will hit Gympie Street North. Turn right and follow this road for about 550 metres. It will turn a corner into Tunnel Ridge Road, however continue straight ahead on Gympie Street N till the end where there is ample car parking, including for horsefloats.

Alternatively, you might like to make this a there and back adventure starting from either end of the marked trail. Otherwise - consider organising car shuttlers. Amenities are only available at the start on north side.
