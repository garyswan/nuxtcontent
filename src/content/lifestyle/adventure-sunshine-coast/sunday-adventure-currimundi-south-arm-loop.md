A fabulous 3.8 km circuit that takes you to one of the back arms of the Currimundi Lake.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for a walk or ride with the kids (though the track along the water may not be ideal for bikes or prams). The footpath runs parallel with the track. Some of the walk is on neighbourhood roads without pathways, but plenty of wide grassed areas.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
The main highlight of this experience is the bush track along Currimundi Lake where the more adventurous kids can ride in the dirt. A terrific place for a rest break, a spot to go fishing or to just sit on one of the many benches and enjoy the lake environment.

There are also multiple parks along the route for the kids to stop and have a play.

The walk is dog friendly, on a leash, and there is a fenced Dog Park area, providing a safe place to let Fido have a run.

The great thing about this the walk is you can extend the river section all the way to the river mouth by continuing east along the riverside pathway to the end and crossing Nicklin Way.

Note - Mosquitoes can be a problem, so be prepared with insect repellent.

**AFTERWARDS**\
When you are finished, play in a local park, or wander up to the Currimundi Marketplace for coffee or maybe lunch.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Beginning at Ridgehaven Park on Kalana Road (off Nicklin Way) The park is near the roundabout. Plenty of on street parking in front of the park.
