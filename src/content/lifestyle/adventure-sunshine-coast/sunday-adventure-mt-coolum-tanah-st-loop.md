You might have climbed Mt Coolum (and if you haven’t then you’re missing out!), but have you checked out the circuit walk around the base, packed full of fun family-friendly features?

**SUITABILITY**\
This 2.1 km walk is suitable for families and all ages.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
The walk commences at beach access No 94, Tanah St in Mt Coolum at the beginning of the boardwalk to Marcoola.

Once underway the beautiful base aspect of Mt Coolum is evident and it lingers over this trail for the duration. The path tracks alongside not only the mountain but also a premier local golf course.

Those wishing to peek through the trees will be unlucky not to see a plethora of local birdlife including kookaburras and rosellas or even a group of kangaroos enjoying the evening sun.

The turnaround point is the Warrack St Park, a fabulous place for families to enjoy a morning or afternoon pit stop. This area features not only a playground for the younger members, but a basketball hoop and flying fox for the more adventurous. A selection of picnic tables and a BBQ round out the features available.

**AFTERWARDS**\
You will be hard pressed not to want to enjoy a dip in the ocean and or a walk along the beach or the boardwalk.

Hungry? A short 5 minute walk away is the recently renovated Mt Coolum shopping complex featuring cafes, restaurants and further convenience options.

\*\*HOW TO GET THERE\
\*\*Via David Low Way, turn onto Tanah St East and park at the end of the street.
