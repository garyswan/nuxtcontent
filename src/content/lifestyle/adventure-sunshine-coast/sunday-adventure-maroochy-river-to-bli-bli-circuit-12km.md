A 12km cycle, run or long walk that takes you over the David Low Way Bridge, past sugar cane fields, parks and the glorious Maroochy River.

**SUITABILITY**\
Best for experienced bike riders if committing to the full 12km loop as there are sections of busy road. Children on bikes can enjoy sections of the circuit near parks.

The loop makes for a great long walk or run also, but you may need to take advantage of the wide grassed or gravelled areas running alongside the Bli Bli – David Low Way road section from Godfreys Road/ John Lantry Park, as there is only a bike lane until you reach the Bli Bli Bridge.  

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Nothing beats the broad, sweeping views of the Maroochy River from the motorway bridge – a definite stopping point for photos if you haven’t already snapped a few from along the river pathway leading to the bridge. A popular fishing spot called The Cod Hole is sure to have a few keen fishermen moored up just underneath.

Once off the bridge take a sharp right-hand U turn and follow the road under the motorway bridge along Godfreys Road (not Godfreys Ave). Exit this road left onto the David Low Way – Bli Bli road, past the cane fields until you reach Muller Park. This sprawling park area is perfect for a break or a stroll along the banks of the Maroochy River.

After crossing the Bli Bli Bridge you’ll head uphill towards the spectacular Bli Bli Castle then a downward slope leads you to the second of three bridges in this circuit. This homeward section takes you over the last but most architecturally impressive foot bridge back to your starting point at Fishermans Road.

**AFTERWARDS**\
If completing the circuit on a Sunday you can enjoy a stroll through Fishermans Market stalls. There’s an off-leash dog park at the start of the river pathway if you only want to stick to the south side of the river with BBQ facilities, water and toilets. These amenities are also available in the Fishermans Road parking area.

And why not extend your adventure further and head back along the Coastal Pathway running all the way to Alexandra Headland Surf Club and back? Combined with the Maroochy River to Bli Bli Circuit, this makes a 23km journey in total.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Park at Fishermans Road and cross David Low Way at the lights and begin the circuit anti clockwise as this route keeps you on the river footpath and off the road. You’ll have to cross over David Low Way at the lights on Diura Street to access the pathway over the Motorway Bridge.
