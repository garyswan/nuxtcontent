A beautiful, tree-covered short walk or ride along Marcoola Beach. This 1.4km section of the iconic 73km Coastal Pathway links Mudjimba Beach to Mt Coolum Beach with multiple access points to the sandy beach.

**SUITABLILITY**\
Suitable for all walkers and is wheelchair, pram and bike accessible.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
A tranquil and easy walk, this part of the greater Coastal Pathway can be enjoyed even on the hottest of days as almost the entire length of the path is covered by shady trees.

Bird lovers can enjoy the sounds of the many species occupying the coastal heath and surfers can take advantage of the multiple access paths onto Marcoola Beach.

There’s an impressive boardwalk leading up to the lifesaving tower that is worth the detour off the path.

Enjoy the views of the beach, particularly spectacular at sunrise and sunset. A backwards glance from this vantage point allows you to see majestic Mt Coolum in the distance.

There are exits on the residential side of the path that lead you over the wetland zones via boardwalks to parks and amenities. Access 98 has an amenity block and Access 95 – Boardrider Crescent Park, has BBQ facilities if you’d like to make a day of it.

Be sure to take mosquito repellent as the lush, wet surroundings are ideal for mossies and sandflies.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Take a stroll up Mt Coolum and view the coastline from a higher vantage point or enjoy a coffee at one of the many boutique cafes near Mt. Coolum and Marcoola.

Or head back along Marcoola Esplanade and check out the Marcoola North Foreshore and the Lorraine Avenue precinct. Council is undertaking a masterplanning process for these areas which has been extended to 21 January.  The online feedback survey can be found here: <https://bit.ly/3HVdiXO>


**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Take the airport turnoff and stay on David Low Way. Turn onto North Shore Connection Road and follow it before turning right onto Petrie Avenue. Turn off Petrie Avenue and drive along Marcoola Esplanade until you see the parking area at the start of the pathway. Parking anywhere along the esplanade is usually easy except on busy weekends.
