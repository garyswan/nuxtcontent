Picture this… A lovely 1km timber boardwalk, alongside Obi Obi Creek, leading you through a stunning subtropical rainforest with many viewing platforms to behold a number of enchanting creatures, including platypuses and turtles. What are you waiting for?!

SUITABILITY

Suitable for walkers, prams and wheelchairs – a flat boardwalk all the way.

HIGHLIGHTS

The boardwalk is fully shaded by trees and if you go early, around 7am, or late in the day, you should be lucky enough to catch sight of a platypus or two from one of the viewing platforms. At times you can also see turtles, water dragons and bright azure kingfishers. These captivating creatures make this place a delight for people of all ages.

The Obi Obi Boardwalk is part of the Maleny Trail Circuit established as part of the Maleny Community Precinct. The full circuit is 6.7km starting at the Maleny Showgrounds.

AFTERWARDS

Head back down to Tesch Park and enjoy the park facilities including a fenced playground, shelters with picnic and barbecue facilities, as well as public amenities. The parkland extends past the Maleny Library and along the Obi Obi Creek. You can enjoy picturesque views along a short walking trail and spend time relaxing in the open parkland (known as Pecan Park).

Or if you're feeling energetic, do the whole 6.7kms Maleny Trail Circuit! Because of the cooler mountain air and deciduous trees, this a beautiful trail to do in Autumn and Winter months.

HOW TO GET THERE

Head to the roundabout at the junction of Maple, Coral and Bunya Streets and find a car park close by (look for Tesch Park or the library building).

Follow the shared path up Coral Street, until you reach the intersection of Bicentenary Lane. There is a large green sign identifying the official entrance to the boardwalk.
