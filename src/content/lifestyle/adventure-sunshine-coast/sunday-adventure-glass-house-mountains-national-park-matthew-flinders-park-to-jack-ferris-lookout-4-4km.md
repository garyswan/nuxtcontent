A great way to experience view stunning Tibrogargan without the crowds.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for most walkers, trail runners and mountain bikers.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This 4.4km trail from Matthew Flinders Park to Jack Ferris Lookout is a neat, mostly level, trail that puts you right in the midst of the Glass House Mountains. It starts at Matthew Flinders Park, where it can be easier to park on weekends. Head west under the rail bridge and along the quiet Caves Road with macadamia orchards on your left and tall gums and other trees on your right.

Along this section of the road – at the right time of day – you can encounter large flocks of black cockatoos. Back at Matthew Flinders Park there are some interesting information boards to round out this experience, including a cairn that commemorates the site nearby where Matthew Flinders camped in July 1799. There are toilets here and sheltered picnic tables and water.

**AFTERWARDS**\
To continue a connection with Matthew Flinders, why not climb Mount Beerburrum, which Flinders summitted in 1799. The climb, accessible from Beerburrum (just south of Matthew Flinders Park) is the quickest way to get some heights and 360 degree views of the area.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Matthew Flinders Park is located just off Steve Irwin Way, approximately 2.5 km north of Beerburrum and 6 km south of the township of Glass House Mountains.
