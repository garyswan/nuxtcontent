Discover the hidden gem of the hinterland with this delightful 3.6km circuit through the charming town.

**SUITABILITY**\
This walk (or ride) is suitable for all ages and abilities.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Woombye is a rural township in the eastern foothills of the Blackall Range, established in the early 1870s as ‘Cobb’s Camp’.

Cobb’s Camp was established by Cobb & Co, which ran a coach service between Brisbane and the Gympie goldfields in late 1867.

The walk will take you right through the centre of town, before embarking on a journey through the residential township.

You will note the history of the ‘Cobbs Camp’ is still very much present in the town, with several buildings, including the amenities a mural backdrop and reminder of the town's early beginnings.

The main street is picture perfect with its sweeping mountain views and quaint old shops, yet behind this sleepy façade is every convenience you could possibly need.

There are plenty of iconic buildings, from the local pub (that celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2000), the beautiful School of Arts (including a library) and the War Memorial located in the centre of town. Keep an eye out for charming old properties and beautifully restored homes.

If you're taking the family on the adventure, there are plenty of local parks to enjoy along the way.
