Gorgeous paddle around Goat Island near the mouth of the Maroochy River where you will see clear water, sandy banks and perhaps stingrays and a pelican or several.

**SUITABLILITY**\
Perfect for beginner kayakers.\
\*\*\
HIGHLIGHTS\*\*\
A pretty 4.3km lap that can be the clearest water of all the Maroochy river paddles. You may see stingrays, fish of various sizes and of course seabirds.

Choose your paddle by watching the weather and tides as that can severely affect your mileage, including currents. Look out for the wreck of the "Gneering", a steamer that serviced the river and was wrecked on the Maroochy River bar and later towed to Goat Island and left there.

If it’s an adventure with your canine friend you’re after, then launch your paddle from the leash free dog section of North Shore and paddle down to the Twin Waters boat ramp and back. This area is perfect for training your dog to paddle with you.
