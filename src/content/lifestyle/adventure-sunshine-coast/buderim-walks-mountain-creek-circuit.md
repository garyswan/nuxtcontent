Enjoy two looped bush and water trails (3.9km in length) in this hidden little gem tucked just behind Kawana and Mooloolaba.

**SUITABILITY**

Suitable for walkers and recreational cyclists. It’s an easy grade trail. Dogs on lead (or in a pram) are also allowed.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

This gorgeous little circuit in Mountain Creek (sometimes called Mountain Creek Recreation Trail) takes in a range of settings – creekside, wetlands and forest trails. You can see Black butt and Bottle brush, blue wrens and rainbow lorikeets, bush turkeys as well as swamp wallabies and lace monitor lizard.

This is a great option with kids as it’s roughly a figure 8 circuit so you need only do part.

It’s also the perfect way to get the kids on a bike for the first time as it's relatively flat. There are spots with seating to stop and rest and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Some areas even loop close enough to the creek banks for a watery view.

Access points abound but with limited parking at each one. A great starting point is off Parklea Esplanade, which has a nice park and playground.

There are links through the bushland to adjoining residential streets. Other entrance points are Coho Court or Felicia Court.

**AFTERWARDS**

Pop over to Kawana and have a surf or go to Brightwater (Freshwater St) and do the lake circuit there on foot or bikes before enjoying refreshments at the Brightwater Hotel.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Heading north on the Sunshine Motorway take the Mountain Creek exit, turn left into Glenfields Boulevard and right into Parklea Esplanade. Park opposite the park. Heading south on the Sunshine Motorway, take the Mountain Creek exit, turn right on to Karawatha Drive and then left onto Prelude Drive which joins Glenfields Boulevard.
