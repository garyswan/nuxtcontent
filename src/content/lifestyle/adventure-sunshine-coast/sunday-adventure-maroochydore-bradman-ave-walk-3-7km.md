Have you been to this beloved stretch of coastal pathway since its huge facelift was completed at the end of 2020? Locals and visitors alike agree, this stunning riverside spot, jam-packed with highlights, has never looked better… Definitely an adventure not to be missed!

#### **SUITABILITY**

This walk (or ride) is accessible and suitable for families and all ages, including pram and wheelchair friendly - and dogs are allowed on-lead.

#### **HIGHLIGHTS**

The walk begins at the Maroochydore Sports Complex where there is plenty of parking available.

The area is perfect for families and features a playground, toilet facilities and green space beside the river.

Those looking to pick up some goodies for the walk should time their adventure with the local Sunday farmers markets, an excellent addition to the adventure!

The walk continues along the Maroochy River, with several scenic bench seats, and jetties dotted along the way.

The views of the river are spectacular with a range of watercraft, islands and birdlife visible for the keen-eyed walker. There is also a new undercover viewing deck on the bank of the river, with an all abilities viewing node.

As well as new contemporary furniture, updated landscaping providing more shade for picnics, a new amenity block at Cod Hole Park and a refurbished kayak ramp, the recent upgrade saw the pathways along Bradman Ave widened, providing heaps more room for pedestrians and cyclists alike.

For those wanting to add to the experience, why not bring the fishing rod and take advantage of the many fishing spots? Or get out onto the water with a hired boat?

The turnaround point is Adolph Blanck Park.

#### **AFTERWARDS**

If you haven’t filled your bag with treats from the markets, there are a number of cafes and fish’n’chip shops along the way to grab a bite to eat and enjoy by the water.

#### **HOW TO GET THERE**

Via Sunshine Coast Motorway, take the Bradman Ave exit and turn left onto Fishermans Rd. The park is on your right.
