A family and pet friendly 2.5km return walk with lots of greenery and water views along the way.

**SUITABILITY**\
All ages. Great for walking, running or bike riding. Wide and flat pathways, perfect for prams and wheelchairs. Dogs on a leash are allowed.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Lots of shady trees, with the bush to one side of the path.

The walk passes the very well-maintained dog park, a great opportunity for the dog to have a run, with covered seating to watch from.

The large open sports fields can be a hive of activity at the weekend, but otherwise a large grassy oval to relax on.

Further on, pass by the Brightwater State School.

The walk can finish soon after at Kawana Way, returning past the school and sports oval. However, if there is an urge for coffee, turn right onto the Kawana Way footpath and in about 50m turn right for a pleasant stroll along Brightwater Boulevard, continuing straight ahead. At the second roundabout, and on your left, is the Brightwater Shopping Centre, while straight ahead is the Brightwater Tavern.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Stroll on over to the Brightwater shops for coffee or a snack - which is off to the left of the starting point along the pathway around the lake. If the little ones haven't had enough exercise, there is a big playground there. (If you have completed the circuit, you will have already found the shops and the Tavern, ready to enjoy refreshments.)

**GETTING THERE**\
Access by car is from the end of Lamatia Drive in Brightwater (as highlighted in blue on the map).
