Tucked away in the centre of Nambour, explore this tropical rainforest and secluded waterfall. A true hinterland hidden gem.

**SUITABILITY**

This is a pathway suitable for walkers, however, it can be slippery and involves crossing a small section of rocks to complete the loop. Children should be accompanied by an adult, as the falls are not cordoned off.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

The short bush walk to the waterfall can be found at the Cilento Bushland Conservation Reserve.

Upon arrival you will be greeted by a large open parkland, picnic tables, BBQ facilities, play equipment for the kids and amenities.

The entrance to the trail can be found behind the picnic tables, which guides you on a short bush track to the bottom of the waterfall.

Walking through the tropical rainforest you can hear the birds chirping and the relaxing sounds of water falling.

Be careful as you approach the falls, as the waterfall is not fenced off and can be very slippery. This gorgeous view is a popular location for local photographers and swimmers on a hot summer day!

As you commence your walk back to the reserve, the bush track inclines with sections of graded steps.

As you get close to the finish, you will need to cross a section of rocks. Be careful as the rocks are slippery, and you need to do a small jump to continue the loop back to the reserve.

Be careful if there has been significant rainfall, as sections of the track may be flooded.

**AFTERWARDS**

Spend some time soaking up the tranquil nature of the reserve, let the kids play in the park, enjoy a family picnic or BBQ in the shelters provided.

Forgot to bring lunch? No problem. Head into town and explore a thriving regional hub and unique cafes.

Visiting a loved one in the nearby hospital? Grab a coffee and take a short walk to the reserve.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

The short circuit bushwalk to the waterfall can be found at The Cilento Bushland Conservation Reserve in Waterfall Road, Nambour, off Mapleton Road, across from the Nambour Hospital.

On-street parking is available at the end of the road (no dedicated car park).
