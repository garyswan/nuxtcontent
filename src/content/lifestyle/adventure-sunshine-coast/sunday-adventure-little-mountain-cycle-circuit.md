An easy, family-friendly 1.7km cycle or walk around the park and lake area off Parklands Boulevard, Little Mountain.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for all age groups and abilities – cyclists and walkers. Playground stops for families. Wheelchair accessible if you stick to the concrete pathway and boardwalks, but sections through the forest are uneven dirt paths.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This circuit has surprising tranquil spots to stop and enjoy the views of the local lake. Wide boardwalks and paved walkways make it easy to navigate your way around the parklands area.

If you’re lucky, you’ll even see a family of swans or other nesting birds enjoying the lake as well.

There are parks and playgrounds along the route and the starting point off High Park Crescent has barbecue facilities.

If you stay on the pathway, the circuit is easy to navigate around the residential area.

There are tracks suitable for mountain bikes through the parkland bush areas, but these can be a little muddy after rain.

Some sections of the circuit cross over roads, so be mindful of local traffic.

**AFTERWARDS**\
You are not far from some local shops on Parklands Boulevard if you need some refreshments after your journey.

Dicky Beach and Currimundi Lake are a short drive away should you wish to follow up with a swim.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The circuit can be accessed from multiple locations depending on where you want to park. Turn into the residential area off Parklands into Little Mountain Drive then take a left turn onto High Park Crescent. There is off street parking here but plenty of other street parking available along this road.
