A fabulous, mostly flat circuit taking in the old Beerburrum Cemetery, views of Tibrogargan and native birdlife.

**SUITABILITY**

Suitable for walkers and mountain bikers.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

This is a wonderful, predominately flat circuit that offers good views of Glass House Mountain peaks above, with usually a lot less people along the way and an easier access route. If you do this walk late in the afternoon or early in the morning, you are likely to come across large flocks of Black cockatoos. Plus, these are the best times to go to avoid the summer heat!

Make sure to pop up to Jack Ferris Lookout as the views of the local mountains are well worth it and it is a sight well earned by the journey here. Drop down off the lookout and you will leave the park along Caves Road to Mathew Flinders Park and the return path heads south along Steve Irwin Way back to Beerburrum and your train or car.

**AFTERWARDS**

While you are in this area, the Dularcha Tunnel is worth an explore. It runs between Landsborough and Mooloolah. Ewen Maddock Dam Main Track is also a great walk and mountain bike as well. Or check out the other trail options right there in the Glass House Mountains National Park.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Heading South (or north) on Steve Irwin Way turn west into Beerburrum Road. You will immediately cross over the railway line and find Parrot Park on the right. You can park your car here or continue on a short way and turn right into the schoolâ€™s carpark, where you see a blue cemetery sign.

This walk effectively starts and ends in Beerburrum, (either at Parrot Park or the School car park).

There are toilets in Beerburrum at Parrot Park and at Matthew Flinders Park on Steve Irwin Way. Take drinking water with you.
