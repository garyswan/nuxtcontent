Have you visited Eumundi lately? Whether from out-of-town or a local Sunshine Coaster, this beautiful, historic, small town is well worth exploring with much to see and do along the way for all the family.

**SUITABILITY**\
This 1.9km accessible walk is suitable for families and all ages.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
The feature packed walk commences at the Eumundi Train Station car park and makes its way up Memorial Drive.

The local amphitheatre on the right-hand side, features lush open green space, local sculpture works as well as public amenities.

The main street is a definite highlight and showcases a range of local goods, cafes, restaurants, and boutique shops.

The famous Eumundi Markets are located on the main street and if you are lucky to time your walk with market day, you will be met with an astonishing array of local food, souvenirs, and artisanal producers.

Amongst the market footprint is one of the Sunshine Coast’s best playgrounds, the perfect place to stop with a lunch or a coffee while the kids run wild!

Once past the main street quaint local homes and a sweeping view of Mt Ninderry come into view.

The turnaround spot is the historic Eumundi Showgrounds.
