This 2.4km walk, waterfall and rock pools are iconic and a must for anyone growing up on the Sunshine Coast.

SUITABILITY

Suitable for walkers with reasonable fitness as there are over 300 steps down to the falls.

HIGHLIGHTS

Kondalilla National Park is a cool and very popular mountain retreat nearly all year round.

The park is named after the spectacular Kondalilla Falls, where Skene Creek drops 90m into a rainforest valley.

Kondalilla, an Aboriginal word meaning 'rushing waters', describes this park's waterfall during the summer wet season.

WHAT YOU'LL SEE

The Kondalilla Falls walk is part of the first section of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland Great Walk.

The pathway is beautifully built for an accessible yet exciting experience.

The manicured path means you can really enjoy the surrounding scenery on this short walk without having to watch your feet, and be mesmerised by the sound of the creek and birdlife in the virgin forest.

There are high and low paths that make a loop called Picnic Creek Circuit, with a diversion to the 100m high falls and swimming hole below (bring your togs).

Make this adventure high on your list, it’s well worth it. Don't be put off by all the steps!

AFTERWARDS

Enjoy a picnic or BBQ lunch in the park above the falls.

Alternatively, the charming, historic town of Montville is but a minute's drive away for sweet treats and souveniers.

HOW TO GET THERE

Travel north on Main Street from Montville for about 2.6km. Turn left onto Kondalilla Falls Rd and travel another 700m to the park entrance.
