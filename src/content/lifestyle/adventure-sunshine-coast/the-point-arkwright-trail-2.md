A 1km bush and coastline walk to one of the Sunshine Coast’s most spectacular headlands. Part of the Sunshine Coast Coastal Pathway, this trail is a classic, must-do for anyone who considers themselves a ‘local’, and high on your agenda, even if just here for a short stay.

**SUITABILITY**

A spectacular scenic experience in all weather and for walkers of all abilities - the pathway from Coolum Beach to Point Arkwright is relatively easy.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

This trail takes you through bushland and also gives you views over secluded bays popular with experienced surfers and a quieter stretch of the scenic coastline.

At Point Arkwright there is car park, public toilets, picnic shelter and expansive coastal views north up to the Noosa Headland and south to Moreton Island.

Point Arkwright is a great place to view migrating whales heading south during Spring. There could even be dolphin and turtle sightings if you’re in luck.

**DIRECTIONS**

Start in the carpark near the bus stop approximately 1.2 km south of the Coolum Surf Club. The pathway leads south from the carpark. Take this coastal path that winds its way above the beaches to Point Arkwright, rather than walk alongside the main road as this is often busy.

**AFTERWARDS**

On your return, you may want to duck down to the hidden Arkwright beach below the carpark and enjoy some sand between your toes. Remember don’t swim outside the flags!

For longer walk options you can continue walking south along the beach to Yaroomba.

Alternatively, head to Coolum Beach where you can enjoy an icecream, coffee or drink at the Coolum Beach shops or pop into the Surf Life Saving Club where visitors are welcome.
