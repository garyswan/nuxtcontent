A family-friendly 1.6km (one way) walk around one of the few remaining patches of coastal forest in Mooloolaba.

**SUITABILITY**\
This flat, well shaded walk is suitable for all ages and family members – including Fido on a leash. Also jogging, cycling, wheelchair and pram friendly. There is limited seating around the walk. Great for a family outing on a weekend afternoon.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This 20 min walk leads through a patch of coastal rain forest with towering paperbark trees and palms providing ample shade and valuable habitat for local wildlife.

Keep an eye out for the flying fox roost on the western section of the walk and the odd water dragon sunning itself on the edge of the path.

Families can stop at the play area halfway on the walk, located 100m off the path towards the north.

To complete the loop, walk along Goonawarra Drive and up Amarina Avenue or back.

For a longer walk or bike ride this path connects to bike ways to Mooloolaba Esplanade and to Buderim.
