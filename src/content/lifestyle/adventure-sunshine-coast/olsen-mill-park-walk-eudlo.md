Far from the crowds, take a lovely drive through the countryside and enjoy this peaceful, picturesque walk in charming Eudlo.     

**SUITABILITY**\
Perfect for walkers and families. Wheelchair, pram and bike friendly. 

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This large parkland is located on the banks of Eudlo Creek and is named after the Olsen Mill, which was destroyed by fire in 2013 – a significant piece of Sunshine Coast history.

The timber industry was the means of livelihood for the early settlers, who either treated or railed large quantities of timber from the Blackall Range.

The large grassed area is circled by a 500m pathway with remnant cattle holding yards located near the centre, along with a picnic shelter and park seating.

The peace and quiet of the parkland will certainly see you coming back again.

**AFTERWARDS**\
It is very easy to spend some time in this quaint, rural village.

Enjoy the facilities of the Eudlo Skate Park, located opposite the local shop and post office, and adjacent to the tennis courts and railway station. The park not only provides skaters, bladers and bikers with plenty of challenges, but has a playground, picnic shelter, BBQ and amenities for the whole family to enjoy.

There are also a couple of cute little cafes nearby where you can grab a coffee or a bite to eat.

Nestled in the countryside, this truly is a hidden gem of the Sunshine Coast.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The entrance to Olsen Mill Park is just near the post office in the main street of Eudlo, Rosebed Street. Travelling north or south on the Bruce Highway, take the exit to Tanawha Tourist Drive, then turn onto Ilkley Road and continue along this stretch of road (turns into Anzac Road) until you reach Rosebed Street. Turn right and park anywhere along the street.
