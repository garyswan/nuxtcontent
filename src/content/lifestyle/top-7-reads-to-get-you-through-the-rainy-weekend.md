**4. [It Ends With Us](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=844363)
&#x20;by Colleen Hoover** - Sometimes the one who loves you is the one who hurts you the most. With this bold and deeply personal novel, *It Ends With Us* is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

**5. [Fix the system, not the women](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=878648)
&#x20;by Laura Bates** - Too often, we blame women. For walking home alone at night. For not demanding a seat at the table. For not overcoming the odds that are stacked against them. This distracts us from the real problem: the failings and biases of a society that was not built for women. In this explosive book, feminist writer and activist Laura Bates exposes the systemic prejudice at the heart of five of our key institutions.

**6. [The Tilt](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=884921)
&#x20;by Chris Hammer** - The latest stunning thriller from the bestselling author of *Scrublands* and *Treasure & Dirt*. Newly-minted homicide detective Nell Buchanan returns to her home town, annoyed at being assigned a decades-old murder - a 'file and forget'. But this is no ordinary cold case, as the discovery of more bodies triggers a chain of escalating events in the present day. As Nell starts to join the pieces together, she begins to question how well she truly knows those closest to her. Could her own family be implicated in the crimes?

**7. [The Mother](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=867488)
&#x20;by Jane Caro** - From the Walkley Award winning journalist, social commentator and author comes a gripping domestic thriller with a moral dilemma at its core. A timely, tense and important story that takes you to the heart of a toxic relationship, fighting to get free.
