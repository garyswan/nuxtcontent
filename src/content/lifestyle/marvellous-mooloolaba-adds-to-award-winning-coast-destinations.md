A swell of five-star reviews has seen Mooloolaba sail into the [Top 10 beaches in the South Pacific for the 2022 TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards.](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TravelersChoice-Beaches-cTop-g255104)
&#x20; 

According to the global website, Mooloolaba rated seventh in the highly regarded awards, which are based on [traveller reviews](https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g261638-d5565847-Reviews-Mooloolaba_Beach-Mooloolaba_Sunshine_Coast_Queensland.html)
. *“Best swimming beach in Australia”* & “*one of my favourite spots in the world”* were among the 1416 five-star reviews for Mooloolaba Beach posted on TripAdvisor.  

It’s the latest in a string of recent awards for Mooloolaba Beach, which [was rated number four in TripAdvisor’s Top 25 Australian beaches in 2019.](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Mooloolaba-Better-than-Bondi-280219)


A stunning new vantage point was recently opened to the public at the picturesque location, with the first section of the Northern Park.

Our community and visitors love the new boardwalk which takes in the sensational views of Mooloolaba Beach down to Point Cartwright.

Mooloolaba has been a hive of activity of late, with works now underway to install a one-of-a-kind children’s adventure playground in the heart of Mooloolaba as part of Sunshine Coast Council’s Stage 1, Northern Parkland works.

This exciting new family-friendly play space is the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere, especially designed for children of all ages and abilities.

But the Sunshine Coast region’s top gongs don’t stop there, with Caloundra being named the second-best town in Australia, thanks to Wotif's 2022 Aussie Town of the Year Awards.

The family friendly region, cheekily referred to as “not Noosa” in a recent marketing campaign, is quickly becoming a hotspot for families and visitors to the region.

Further inland to the lush hinterland, booking.com recently crowned Maleny as the most welcoming town in Australia.
