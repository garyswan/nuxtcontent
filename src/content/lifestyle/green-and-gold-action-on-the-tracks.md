On Sunday 7 August, more than 200 Olympic mountain biking hopefuls hit the tracks at the Sugar Bag Road Mountain Bike Trails as part of the Green and Gold runway program.

These events are being held across Queensland demonstrating we don’t need to wait until 2032 to enjoy the benefits of the Olympic and Paralympic Games coming to Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast in 2032.

Aspiring Olympians got on their bikes and rubbed shoulders with world-class mountain biking champions to help celebrate 10 years until the Sunshine Coast delivers key events for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said it was fantastic to witness the thrill-seekers having a go and getting back to nature during this action-packed event.

“Mountain biking sessions, pumping and cornering activities, and other skill-based demos were all part of the outdoor fun and, who knows, our next future Olympic or Paralympic athlete may have been inspired to take up the sport professionally at this special event,” he said.

“Mountain biking will be an integral part of the 2032 Games and we have a great array of mountain bike facilities in our region.

“The proposed venue for the 2032 competition is an upgraded and expanded Parklands Mountain Biking Trails which, once developed, will be a great asset for our region for many years to come."
