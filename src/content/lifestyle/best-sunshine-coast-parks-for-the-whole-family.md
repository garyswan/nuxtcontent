The school holidays are here and it’s time to pack a picnic and head out and discover some of the Sunshine Coast’s best family parks.

There will be something for everyone with our region’s parks offering beautiful, shaded areas to kick a ball around, playgrounds that spark kids’ imaginations, BBQ and picnic areas to enjoy lunch out in nature and even dog friendly locations.

We’ve compiled a list of some of the region’s best family parks that are worth travelling for:

### Glass House Mountains District Park

Combining a mix of open space, bushland and wetlands this district park is home to the much-loved treetop suspension playground.

This hinterland park has something for dog lovers, exercise enthusiasts and fun-seeking kids.

The treetop playground includes rope bridges suspended high above the ground, multiple slippery-slides designed for maximum speed and enough swings, merry-go-rounds, climbing gyms and cubby-houses to entertain kids young and old.

With plenty of space for dogs to run and rummage, park-goers can access the fully fenced [dog-off-leash](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Beaches-and-Parks/Beaches-and-Parks-Directory/Glass-House-Mountains-Dog-Park)
&#x20;area via Page Street.
