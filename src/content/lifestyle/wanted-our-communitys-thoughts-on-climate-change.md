A collaborative approach to respond to climate change on the Sunshine Coast is the focus of a new pilot project which plans for current and emerging climate risks.

Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with Noosa Shire Council, has received a Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) grant to pilot the first phase of the ‘Queensland Climate Resilient Councils (QCRC) Climate Risk Management Framework’ – an approach to assist local governments address climate risk now and into the future.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said this project would see both councils working with industry, community leaders and state government agencies to identify climate risks and ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt and identify opportunities.

“To get started on this important project, Council is seeking input through a survey to establish a baseline understanding of the community’s collective thoughts on climate change,” Cr Suarez said.

“The survey results will inform the creation of a toolkit to inform our community on ways to mitigate and adapt to projected climate risks in the future.”

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the funding would build on the substantial work both councils were already undertaking to prepare our regions and communities for the impacts of a changing climate.

“The project encourages a collaborative approach to this important issue and working on a regional scale provides opportunities to manage climate risk holistically across the two local government areas,” Cr Cox said.

“It will help our communities be better prepared and ultimately stronger.”

Noosa Shire Council’s Climate Change Spokesperson Councillor Brian Stockwell said timely action would put our region in the best possible position to respond to the growing threats to our lifestyle, economy and environment.

“We want to hear from the community to make sure we’re delivering a toolkit that works for you, so I’d encourage everyone to complete the survey so your input is captured,” Cr Stockwell said

“By the end of this pilot project, we will have laid an important foundation to develop a broader roadmap and climate response plan for our region into the future.”    

The QCRC program is a partnership between the Department of Environment and Science and the Local Government Association of Queensland which is delivering services and products to Queensland local governments to increase their capability to take actions to mitigate and adapt to climate risk.

To complete the survey head to council’s website ([sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Sustainability-and-Climate-Change/Climate-Change)
) by Sunday, October 24, 2021.
