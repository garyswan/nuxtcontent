Join nutritionist and dietitian, Jody Pollard for a fun and interactive workshop with healthy recipe demonstrations.

Workshop facilitator, Jody Pollard said the sessions discussed and demonstrated ways to make healthy food that is easy to prepare and tastes delicious.  

“It’s about meeting your own specific nutritional requirements, taste preferences, kitchen skills and time limitations,” Ms Pollard said.

“As a food lover and a dietitian my passion is to make delicious healthy eating easy and achievable for everyone. We all know how good we feel when we fuel our body well, but time, money, motivation, skills and ideas can get in the way and trip us up when it comes to meal planning, preparations and food choices.

“Everyone has their own experience with food, and we share ideas and experiences creating a nice community experience during each session.”

Three Nutrition Presentation and Recipe Demonstration sessions with Jody are available for bookings.

#### **When:**

*   Thursday 20 April (Nutrition and Healthy Ageing)
*   Thursday 11 May (Eating for Heart Health)
*   Thursday 8 June (Healthy Eating in the Winter Months)

#### **Where:** Resolve Fitness, Mind and Body Studio, 19 West Terrace, Caloundra (near the back carpark of Caloundra RSL)

#### **Time:** 11am

#### Classes cost $10/Adult or $5 with a Health Care/Pensioner card.
