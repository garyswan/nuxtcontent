On the Sunshine Coast, summer holidays means everyone is on the move.

Why not take advantage of the sustainable travel options available and reduce your environmental footprint.

**Walking & Cycling**

Breathe in the fresh air, get your steps in and avoid car parking hassles.

![](https://preview-assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c631baf8-1b46-001f-580c-d0001b68b4a8/5050bbe5-866a-4c9e-852d-2e2722f4d8df/Coastal-Pathway-couple-bike-boardwalk-landscape-COOLUM-WEB-1024x683.jpg)

Coolum is a hilly but scenic section of the coastal pathway and is a tourist hotspot with beachside fun right across the road from shopping and dining.

There are plenty of accessible pathways across the region, including the iconic Coastal Pathway, which stretches 73km from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north and offers sections for all levels of fitness just metres from the ocean.

Everything you need to know about the Coastal Pathway can be found [here](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
.

You will also find bike parking available in the heart of Mooloolaba at the ParknGo Mooloolaba Central facility. Park your bike and go enjoy the beach or grab a coffee or a bite to eat with friends. [More information](https://www.parkngo.com.au/)
.  

For a full list of bike friendly pathways, tracks and trails on offer [visit](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Cycling/Routes)

**Share with care**

Remember to share the path when walking, riding and scootering these holidays.

**Simple rules and tips to follow:**

*   don’t obstruct the path, keep left and give way to pedestrians
*   warn when approaching - cyclists and scooter users please use a bell, skateboarders politely call out
*   stop and look before leaving the path or when crossing the road
*   Be kind and care for others when sharing pathways over the holidays
*   Keep dogs on a short leash, to your left
*   slow down when passing others on the pathway

.

**Public Transport**

Leave the car at home and catch the bus instead!

Skip the traffic queues, sit back, and relax while TransLink take you in airconditioned comfort to where you want to go.

Ensure you pack a pre-loaded *go* card for 30% off your fee or pre-purchase your ticket as the network is currently cashless.

You can buy or top-up *go* cards [online](http://www.translink.com.au/)
, at local retailers or by calling TransLink on 13 12 30.

You can even set up auto top-up - so you always have money to travel!

Grab a *go* explore card and for just $10 (adult) and $5 (child) per day, enjoy unlimited travel on TransLink Sunbus services throughout the coast.

Effortlessly plan your trip using the [online journey planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner)
&#x20;to find the best travel option for you.

Download the MyTransLink app (available for free from the App Store or Google Play) or visit the TransLink website: <https://translink.com.au/travel-with-us/around-queensland/sunshine-coast>


Get out and about these holidays, sustainably.
