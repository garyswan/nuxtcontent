The wait is almost over for Sunshine Coast residents and visitors to enjoy the new splash pad at the Nambour Aquatic Centre.

The zero-depth and fully accessible splash pad play area will open on Saturday 22 January 2022, and forms part of the much-anticipated splash park being developed with the support of Sunshine Coast Council, the Queensland Government’s Works for Queensland program, and pool lessee Belgravia Leisure.

The $3.26 million investment includes the recent addition of 44 new car parking spaces and two adventures slides which are set to open later in the year.

Councillor David Law said the project would deliver a water wonderland in the heart of the hinterland and be a drawcard to the town.

Together with the Centre’s existing 50 metre lap pool and 25 metre indoor pool, which also has a mechanical chair that lowers into the pool for disability access, the new water play facilities will allow people of all ages to enjoy hours of healthy and active fun.

“It has been a challenging project, and like many construction projects across Australia, we’ve experienced material and supply delays caused by the global pandemic,” Cr Law said.

“I’m thrilled our community will now be able to enjoy early access to the splash pad, prior to the official opening of the splash park later this year.”

The splash pad features 385 square metres of waterplay with two toddler slides, 20 water jet features and tipping buckets.

As well as providing hours of family fun, the splash pad will encourage children’s physical and sensory development through interaction with water play elements.

Entry to the splash pad will be included in the standard pool admission price.

Visitors can enjoy advance access to the splash pad play area from 22 January 2022.

The complete splash park will be officially unveiled with an exciting community event later this year when two new adventure slides, measuring 60 and 67 metres in length are open.

The splash park will be officially unveiled later this year when the adventure slides open.

The Nambour Aquatic Centre is one of nine council-run aquatic centres across our region, the others are located at Beerwah, Buderim, Caloundra, Coolum-Peregian, Cotton Tree, Eumundi, Kawana, and Palmwoods.
