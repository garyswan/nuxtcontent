Sunshine Coast residents are being urged to brace for what could be a summer of wild weather this Get Ready Queensland Week (October 10-16).

With a La Niña weather system back for another year, Sunshine Coast Council is partnering with the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to encourage the community to be prepared.

The Bureau of Meteorology said the La Niña typically increased the chance of above-average rainfall for northern and eastern Australia during spring and summer.

Local Disaster Management Group (LDMG) Chair and Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said that, living on the Sunshine Coast, we knew disasters could strike quickly.

“It’s not a matter of if, but when, so that’s why it’s important to prepare now so you are best placed to handle whatever Mother Nature throws at us,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Though council and the LDMG continue preparations all year round, each of us has a role to play and being prepared is everyone’s responsibility.”

Mayor Jamieson said there were a few simple steps people could take to help safeguard their family and home.

Step one: [Understand your risk](https://www.getready.qld.gov.au/get-prepared/3-steps-get-ready/step-1-understand-your-risk)
.

Step two: [Prepare a household emergency plan](https://www.getready.qld.gov.au/plan)
.

Step three: [Pack an emergency kit](https://www.getready.qld.gov.au/get-prepared/3-steps-get-ready/step-3-pack-emergency-kit)
.

“An emergency kit should have enough supplies to last three days in case your home loses access to power, water and gas or you become cut off from the supermarket or pharmacy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It should be kept in a strong waterproof storage container and contain items like a first aid kit, important medication, a torch, spare batteries, hand sanitiser, enough food and water for three days and a battery powered radio.

“For a full list, check out the Get Ready Queensland website: [getready.qld.gov.au](http://getready.qld.gov.au)


“I encourage everyone to save a copy of the list and stock up on essentials next time you’re grocery shopping.

“Parts of the Sunshine Coast are still recovering from the heavy rain that hit the region between February and May this year, which caused flooding, fallen trees and major landslips.

“The largest total in our region was in Maleny with Council recording 2200mm of rain during that period.

“Keep safe on our roads and remember – if it’s flooded, forget it.”
