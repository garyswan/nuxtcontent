Shorebirds are shy birds that are easily frightened by people, dogs, and watercraft. Itâ€™s important to keep your distance from shorebirds to avoid disturbing them. To get a good look at shorebirds, sit quietly at a distance and study them through binoculars or a spotting scope.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
