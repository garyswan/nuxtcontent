Need support for a community project, event or activity?

Funding is now available for community organisations through Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Grants Program.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said not-for-profit groups could apply for a Minor Grant to support one-off projects and programs.

“Groups can apply for a Minor Grant of up to $2000 to help fund projects with broad community benefit,” Cr Law said.

“The program aims to acknowledge and strengthen the valuable contribution community groups and their volunteers make towards achieving our shared goal: a strong community.

“Applications are now open and close on May 2.”

One of last year’s minor grants supported hall hire costs, marketing and resource printing for a senior LGBTI community forum at Buderim Memorial Hall. 

The Sunshine Coast LGBTI Community Ageing Network planned the event, which informed, educated and empowered their community on the importance of keeping healthy, maintaining social connection and planning for the senior stage of life.

Sunshine Coast LGBTI Community Ageing Network Co-Chairperson Jennifer Sargent said the group was extremely thankful for the Minor Grant which helped them bring the forum to the community.

“We were able to present practical information and advice to attendees about planning for the future and ageing well with the day hosted by Mardi Gras Miss Fair Day, Vanessa Wagner,” Ms Sargent said.

“I encourage other community groups to apply for funding to help bring your events to life!”

### Minor Grant applications can be submitted in one of six categories:
