Maleny local Natalie Gauci is among 11 Sunshine Coast region creative arts workers to share in more than $65,000 in [Regional Arts Development Funding](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Regional-Arts-Development-Fund)
&#x20;(RADF).

The 2007 Australian Idol winner received $5,000 for the development of her new album, ‘Pictures of Mars’.

Other successful applications included music and theatre development as well as a diverse range of screen and interdisciplinary projects.

Podcasting was a popular area with two projects netting more than $14,000 in funding.

Natalie who was also a contestant in The Voice in 2020 said the album was in the early development stages and would comprise nine songs for release over a four-month period alongside an online TV show and launch event in Caloundra on 28 February.

“I will be writing, producing, arranging and recording these new songs at my home studio in Maleny, where I hope to create music that brings joy and lifts people’s spirits,” Ms Gauci said.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said The Regional Arts Development Fund was a great way to support our thriving local arts industry.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said The Regional Arts Development Fund remained a remarkably successful partnership program, with the state Government, to support our growing local arts industry.

"The range of applicants and project ideas showcases the depth of arts practice and creative endeavours in our region and the many ways these activities can enrich our lives.
