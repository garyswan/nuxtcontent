Following the outstanding success of Horizon Festival’s opening weekend, the 10-day multi-arts festival continues for seven more days and nights, with plenty more to come, right across the Sunshine Coast.

Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold said festival goers were enjoying the stunning Wonderland Spiegeltent festival hub at Cotton Tree.

“If people haven’t had a chance to book tickets, they’re still enjoying the free daily kids’ program and live DJs, enjoying the atmosphere and then booking shows or they’re wandering past and doing the same,” Ms Clissold said.

“It’s great to see so much community support for the arts.

“Tickets to all Speigeltent shows are available on our website [www.horizonfestival.com.au](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/)
&#x20;or there’s also a box office on site during certain times.

“We’ve got some amazing shows still to come including Circa’s Peepshow which, if the gasps, smiles and wows from the first three shows are anything to go by, has been a massive hit since it opened on Friday.

“And with just three more shows to go on August 31, September 1 and 2, I’d encourage booking soon — our box office has been running hot.”

Sunshine Coast Council’s Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said he was thrilled with the reactions the 2022 Horizon Festival had generated so far.

“Our region’s arts ecology is booming at this time,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The Horizon Festival is a huge engine pumping out great content and it’s an absolute highlight on the national arts stage right now.

“We’re only a few days in, and we couldn’t have hoped for a bigger release of pent up demand or a better turn out. It’s testament to the choice of events, quality of the programming and thirst for the arts right here on the Sunshine Coast.”

Another huge name still to come on the Spiegeltent billing is Justine Clarke who’s been dazzling kids all over Australia with her show ‘Everybody Roar’.

“Anyone who likes to sing and dance will love the show,” Ms Clarke said. “It’s a celebration of all the best and most popular music I’ve made over the past 15 years.

“I love sharing my love of music and getting kids to discover the joy of hearing musicians play.”

Catch performances from Justine on August 30 and 31 at 10am. Tickets cost $20 and kids under two are free.

The performance is recommended for children under 10.

Another hilarious highlight is Steven Oliver who’s Bigger and Blacker show will have them rolling out of the tent.

Steven described his event as ‘a bit of rap, a bit of a sing, a bit of a tap and a lot of shaking his ring’.

“People can expect my original songs and lots of laughs,” Mr Oliver said. “There’s showtunes, funky tunes, rap tunes and sexy dancing.

“I’ll have something for everybody and while there might be a couple of cheeky words here and there, my show is for the whole family.”

Steven’s shows are on at the Spiegeltent September 2 at 8.30pm and September 3 at 6.30pm. Tickets cost from $29.

Opening ceremony for Horizon Festival, by Alain Bouvier.

Kids and families have lots to look forward to with comedy performances from Holy Bin Amoley! on September 3 at 10am and 1.30pm and September 4 at 10am.

The show is recommended for kids under 10 and tickets cost $10 with kids under 2 free.

Slowing down a gear, anyone who loves the ethos of getting back to nature, will already know and love the Wildlings Forest School.

Through the festival, they’re offering a range of workshops at the Spiegeltent gardens including painting, flower pressing, clay play and mini boat making.

Workshop tickets are just $20 for a three-hour session and kick off at 9am each day from September 1.

And the highlight, the memory maker, the clincher, is Dawn Awakening.

As the first light rises on the banks for Stumers Creek in Coolum, this moving performance will shift something inside those lucky enough to set their alarm.

Dawn Awakening is at 5am on Sunday September 4 and signals the close of the festival. Register for this free event and plan your festival experience at [www.horizonfestival.com.au](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/)
