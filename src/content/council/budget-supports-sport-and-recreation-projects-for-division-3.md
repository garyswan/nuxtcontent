More than $4.25 million towards the Honeyfarm Road Sport and Recreation Precinct, $200,000 to prepare for the future expansion of the Sunshine Coast Stadium and more than $913,000 towards parks and gardens upgrades are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 3. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said another $4.2 million would be injected into the Kawana Regional Aquatic Centre at Bokarina to implement the centre’s master plan report.\
“This will lift its capacity to a regional level facility and form part of the Kawana Regional Sport and Wellness Precinct,” Cr Cox said.\
“Council is also committing $200,000 towards the adjacent Sunshine Coast Stadium.\
“It is growing in popularity each year and we’ve seen high-level sport and music events hosted at this venue over the past year.

“To keep up with its use, the $200,000 investment will finalise design for future construction of new grandstands and refurbishing and expanding the current western stand.\
“I’m also very pleased with council’s continued investment in the Honeyfarm Road Sport and Recreation Precinct at Meridan Plains.\
“The $4.25 million contribution will go towards undertaking civil works and wetlands area construction in the sports and recreation park precincts.\
“Another $913,000 will be invested in improving our parks and gardens which are well loved and used across Division 3. “These works vary from refurbishing picnic areas, renewing playgrounds and installing drinking fountains.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
