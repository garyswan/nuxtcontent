Spaces that bring the community together are front and centre in the Sunshine Coast Council 2023-24 Budget for the active Division 6 community.

This division includes the suburbs of Buderim Pines, Buderim Meadows, Mountain Creek (Glenfields, Brightwater), Palmview (Harmony, Village Green) and Sippy Downs (Chancellor Park).

Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said this year’s Council budget included a range of projects across the division that would have a positive impact on the community to make our area an even better place to live.  

“This is a budget of the people, with projects that began as requests and ideas from community members,” Cr Dickson said.

“These projects are about getting outdoors, enjoying physical activity, and spending time connecting with family and friends.

“Council has responded to a community petition to expand the Sippy Downs Dog Park at Lakehead Drive and I am excited to announce we’ve secured $100,000 to make this a reality.

“This budget also equips Council to consult with residents at Buderim Meadows and Glenfields on building new dog parks for locals, a great opportunity for residents to help plan and shape their local areas.”

Cr Dickson said he was thrilled to announce $100,000 would support the Mooloolaba Tennis Club in Mountain Creek to build new pickleball courts.

“Pickleball is a rapidly growing sport combining elements of tennis, badminton and ping-pong for a game that is incredibly accessible to all skill and fitness levels.

“It is so important to continue establishing new sporting facilities on the Sunshine Coast and assist grassroots clubs in doing what they do best: keeping people active and healthy.”

The Budget provides funding for a new amenities block in Mountain Creek’s Glenfields Neighbourhood Park and creating a landscaping plan with community input.

“We’ve heard the voices of locals loud and clear and have secured $130,000 towards fulfilling requests for a new toilet block and planning further improvements to this park, which will provide locals with higher quality amenities like those available in newer estates,” Cr Dickson said.

Detailed design work for the Sippy Downs Library and Community Venue will receive a further $705,000 in funding.

“This will ultimately progress us towards being shovel-ready so we can make this facility a reality,” Cr Dickson said.

“The master planning of this important community hub is a top priority among Council’s library projects.”

Cr Dickson said the Budget would fund works that improved safety for pedestrians in the division, especially students.

“We’ve committed $700,000 to improving safety and road crossings for school students at Chancellor Secondary Campus in Sippy Downs.

“This year we will see works begin on a footpath upgrade to improve pedestrian safety along Jingellic Drive, Buderim, a major project that will be funded over multiple Budget years.”

Council handed down its 2023-24 Budget on June 22.
