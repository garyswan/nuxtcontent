The Buderim Mountain State School P\&C Association and school have invited Sunshine Coast Council to help promote safe parking behaviour in the area.

The school and Council will work together to regulate parking along Buderim Main Street, Clithero Avenue and Elizabeth Street, using the ParkSmart program.

The program will be introduced to the area through static cameras that will monitor parking near the school. Cameras will be fixed to poles in key parking locations and use number plate recognition technology to spot unlawful parking.

This program aims to alleviate parking problems at the school by encouraging vehicle turnover, creating parking opportunities and allowing equitable and safe access to the area.

The trial will take place during Term 2 and Term 3, beginning in April and finishing in September 2023, excluding the school holiday period.

There will be a two-week education period during which Council will issue caution notices rather than infringements, so residents have time to get used to the change in parking regulations around the school.

Once the education period is over, infringement notices will be issued by post.

Buderim Mtn Primary P\&C Association President Rachel O’Brien said she hoped the program would contribute to making the school community a safer place.

“As many of the school community will have experienced, parking around the area is congested and can be dangerous,” Mrs O’Brien said.

“The safety of our students, staff and their families, is our top priority. This is why the school community has partnered with Council to help improve parking behaviour.”

### ParkSmart Fast Facts:

1.  The camera captures images of parked vehicles and records the vehicle location (GPS coordinates), number plate and time.
2.  It allows council to monitor regulated parking areas to ensure motorists are adhering to parking regulations.
3.  ParkSmart operates in all weather conditions and identifies regulated parking conditions on the street.
4.  This technology is already being used to regulate parking in Birtinya, Point Cartwright, Nicklin Way, Caloundra, Maroochydore, Nambour and Eumundi via a ParkSmart vehicle to increase safety for all and increase turnover and subsequent business patronage.
