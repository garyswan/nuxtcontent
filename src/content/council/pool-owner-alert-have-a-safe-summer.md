Summer is here and your swimming pool is looking increasingly inviting – but is your swimming pool safe?

Pools capable of holding more than 300mm in depth, which includes all swimming pools, spas, portable and inflatable pools must comply with the Queensland pool safety standard.

Pool owners should be doing regular checks to ensure their swimming pool barriers are compliant.

Be sure your swimming pool is summer ready by visiting council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Building-and-Plumbing/Swimming-Pools)
 or the [Queensland Building and Construction Commission](http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/home-building-owners/pool-safety/overview)
 website for more information about pool safety compliance.
