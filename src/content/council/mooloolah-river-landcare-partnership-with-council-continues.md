Mooloolah River Landcare have secured another three-year grant of $59,000 per year from Sunshine Coast Council through the Environment Levy Partnership Program, helping them to continue caring for their local environment.

This renewal comes as the previous three-year partnership agreement draws to a close, bringing with it a long list of achievements for the group’s 167 volunteers.

Coordinator of Mooloolah River Landcare Karen Schmidt said the Environment Levy grant from council gave the group the freedom to consider and take on new opportunities, as they cared for the Mooloolah River – an important social, economic, and environmental asset to the Sunshine Coast.

“Being part of the headwaters gives us a great opportunity to provide affordable native plants to the community, assist in controlling weeds and manage erosion risks, and educate our community on environmental matters,” Ms Schmidt said.

“We also pride ourselves on the community support and social opportunities we provide to our volunteers and our members.

“Our hub provides a lively social outlet for like-minded people to come together and help the environment.

“We have a healthy core group of regular volunteers who enjoy the interaction with one-another while being able to learn and contribute to helping the environment.

“In the past year, Covid-19 threw a curveball into our standard operations but having the Environment Levy Partnership funding allowed us breathing room to adapt.

“Even though we had to either close or change our native plant nursery opening hours, we still welcomed a boom in volunteers including students, Certificate I and III trainees, retirees and high-needs participants.

“We became an affiliate of the Cane Toad Challenge (CTC) and rolled this program out to Sunshine Coast residents, and established a plant pot recycling program which is free for the public to use and will see skip bins full of pots destined for landfill being recycled into new products.

“We created a relationship with University of the Sunshine Coast, becoming a host organisation for career placement students and our events – such as CTC workshops, Open Day with tours and environmental information, a farm dams’ workshop, a members Christmas party, volunteers Christmas party, and a Koala detection dog demonstration – were sold out.

“And importantly the Environment Levy funding allowed us to establish and operate a biocontrol facility to breed biocontrol beetles to help eradicate madeira vine and cat’s claw creeper - both Weeds of National Significance.

“Both these weeds are significant weeds in our threatened Lowland Subtropical Rainforest.”

Sunshine Coast Division One Councillor and deputy mayor Rick Baberowski said the achievements of the Mooloolah River Landcare were a credit to their vision and dedication of the volunteers; it also helped demonstrate the support provided through the Environment Levy, which was collected across all ratepayers.

“The group is clear about their convictions and going from strength to strength, which means we can better appreciate how their actions help support our regions natural environment and preserve the biodiversity of our region,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Through the delivery of environmental improvements through on-ground activities and their community education programs, Mooloolah River Landcare are protecting our environment and partnering with council to deliver the Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability strategy objectives.

“I’d also like to take this opportunity to recognise all the division one recipients of the Environment Levy Partnership Grants and sincerely thank them for their continued important work, particularly during these challenging and difficult times when the normal patterns of operations simply don’t work.”
