The launch of The Refinery 5.0 signals a major positive change for the arts and creative industry on the Sunshine Coast.

The Refinery is an annual creative business incubator program designed to support independent artists and creative industry practitioners establish and grow viable and sustainable businesses. 

The program was launched in 2019 through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council, SunCentral and the MET, and the Sunshine Coast Creative Alliance (SCCA).

Having already supported 58 creative businesses across four successful years, Refinery 5.0 will be delivered by SCCA, marking an important milestone in the growth of the arts sector on the Coast.

SCCA President Liz Burcham said taking responsibility for The Refinery will see SCCA continue to play a pivotal role in enabling and strengthening the Sunshine Coast’s creative sector.

“Importantly, this opportunity is also a platform to grow the SCCA business model and position it to play a more dynamic leadership role in the region’s creative future.”

Megan Rowland, Team Leader of Creative Development for Council, and Bronwyn Adams, Project Manager City Activation, Maroochydore City Centre for SunCentral were both instrumental in founding The Refinery and are enthusiastic about its future under SCCA’s leadership.

"Council is immensely proud of what has been achieved through The Refinery over the last four years," Megan said.

“As the peak industry body of our region, SCCA is best placed to continue building on the growth.

"Council will be the Refinery 5.0's major investment partner through the new Arts & Heritage Levy and will work closely with SCCA, and The Refinery participants to continue to strengthen the creative ecology of our region and success of the program.”

SCCA will run The Refinery in its proven format of a 10-week intensive program.

This year’s learning curriculum has a renewed focus on personal growth and leadership, designed to build participants’ capacity to grow their practice, gain visibility, understand their value and the context in which they operate.

It will also identify new markets and help foster the region’s next creative leaders.

The Refinery 5.0 will support a total of 20 artists, creative practitioners and entrepreneurs, with five identified First Nations positions, who will also participate in a dedicated First Nations led series, curated and facilitated by leading Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mentors and creatives. 

Expressions of interest are sought from creative practitioners nation-wide. Shortlisted applicants will be invited to a one-day bootcamp on 25 March as part of the selection process. Applications close 1 March.
