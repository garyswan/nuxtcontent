Ashwood Place Wetland, Currimundi has undergone a big transformation recently.

The wetland helps to filter the stormwater before it reaches Currimundi Lake and was full of years of built up sediment and litter.

Now it's looking fresh after extensive work by Sunshine Coast Council over the past few months.

**To restore the wetland, council's team:**

*   removed over 1000 tonnes of black sludge
*   removed 30 wheelie bin size bags of rubbish like bottles, balls, plastic and other litter
*   rebuilt the wetland to best practice industry standards for brackish wetlands - which was a challenge as most wetlands are freshwater
*   planted 6000 new plants along the intertidal zone to allow better nutrient removal
*   installed a new trash rack to stop rubbish going into the lake
*   kept some area as open water to allow for midge control and to quickly remove water during storms.

As you can see in these before and after pictures, the transformation really has been amazing.
