Sunshine Coast Council has taken on board community feedback and will make lane changes at a busy Moffat Beach intersection.

The dedicated right turn southbound lane at the intersection of Buccleugh and Roderick streets will change to a through lane in the coming weeks and, once works are completed, it is expected the current queue lengths will be reduced.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said council would implement the advice provided by independent traffic engineers to improve traffic flow on Buccleugh and surrounding streets.

“The traffic engineers recommended that we remove the right turn only lane into Roderick Street west and, for safety reasons, remove the ability to turn right into that street,” Cr Landsberg said.

“As a result, the right turn lane will be changed to a through-lane only, and the left lane will allow both left turns and through-traffic for Buccleugh Street’s southbound motorists.

“This will make the intersection more efficient and is anticipated to reduce queue lengths on all approaches.

“To minimise inconvenience, these works are scheduled to be completed before the Easter break, weather and site conditions permitting.

“We thank everyone for their patience while we undertake these works and thank the community for raising their concerns.

“We also apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result of traffic delays since changes were made in November.

“Council will continue to keep the community informed as we progress scheduling.”

Cr Landsberg said the surrounding residents and businesses had been informed of the upcoming improvements.
