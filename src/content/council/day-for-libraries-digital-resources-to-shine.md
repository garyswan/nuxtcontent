Libraries’ digital resources will stand front and centre on Wednesday, November 16, when Sunshine Coast Council Libraries close their branches for a one-day staff development session.

During this time the community can still access books, movies music, magazines and so much more, via the library [website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said it was the perfect time for library members to become familiar with the world of free digital library resources available from their phone, tablet or computer.

“With the myLibrary app, libraries are always open with easy access to your member account, loans, reservations and the ever-growing catalogue of thousands of digital resources,” Cr Law said.

“As libraries enter a growth phase with new service delivery opportunities and models, it is essential all staff understand the roadmap ahead.

“The staff development program would give a holistic view of this much-loved community service, what’s important in our service delivery, key services for our community, shared values, and planning for the future.”

Library return chutes will remain open during this time. Libraries will reopen on Thursday, November 17, 2022.

**Sunshine Coast Council Libraries Closed**

**When:** Wednesday, November 16, 2022

**Affected services:** Beerwah Library, Caloundra Library, Coolum Library, Heritage Library, Kawana Library, Kenilworth Library, Maleny Library, Maroochydore Library, Nambour Library and both mobile libraries.
