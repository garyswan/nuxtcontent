This September Sunshine Coast locals should be hugging the rail on our precision-built skate park in the heart of Caloundra.

Skaters, BMXers and scooter riders will soon see their skate park design become reality with Sunshine Coast Council churning through construction since March on a new Dicky Beach concrete playscape.

Stage 1 July and August works will focus on:\
• Completing the finishing touches to the new amenities building.\
• Continuing construction of the new boardwalks and retaining walls.\
• Continuing construction of the new skate park.\
• Landscaping including new plants and trees.

Construction hours will be mainly Monday to Friday, 6am–6pm. Occasional Saturday works will be required.

The majority of the Dicky Beach Park car park remains open to vehicles. Beach access points 266 and 267 remain open to pedestrians however may be intermittently closed for safety reasons associated with nearby construction.
