The Sunshine Coast is set to celebrate our vibrant and diverse region with Harmony Week beginning March 15.

The program will feature important conversations and reflections, along with colourful array of food, dance, sport, culture and workshops exhibiting the beautiful kaleidoscope of faith, linguistic and ethnic diversity we all share on the Sunshine Coast.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said Harmony Week continued to be a highlight of the yearly calendar.

“This year’s theme is ‘Everyone Belongs,’ which is a wonderful fit for our region,” Cr Law said.

“I trust this year’s events will be a great success, and I encourage everyone to don their favourite orange outfits and enjoy the many great activities and experiences on offer across the region.

“Harmony Week continues to be a fantastic opportunity to showcase the Sunshine Coast’s understanding, respect and compassion for our multicultural and multi-faith communities.”

Nambour Community Centre Community Development Coordinator Ana Greenfield said this year’s Harmony Week was shaping up to be another wonderful celebration of the Sunshine Coast community.  

“I am very excited by the diversity of offerings in this year’s program,” Ms Greenfield said.

“The community has made a wonderful contribution.

“I am especially looking forward to the multicultural cricket and soccer activities and the Nambour Forecourt Live show because they are fresh offerings that really celebrate the cultural diversity that is alive here and they demonstrate that everyone belongs on the Sunshine Coast.”

Harmony Week Football Carnival Coordinator and Sunshine Coast Multicultural Advisory Group member Walter Nkemfack said the Sunshine Coast Harmony Cup, to be hosted at the USC Sport Precinct, would be an unmissable event.

“For me, Harmony Week provides an opportunity to connect and celebrate cultures in an effort to reduce the struggles around diversity and inclusion, while creating awareness around multiculturalism by showcasing the strength of a diverse community,” Mr Nkemfack said.

“Football is a globally loved and celebrated sport especially in multicultural communities.

“We are putting on a public display with mini team matches.

“That, combined with food and music, will be a positive public display for everyone to come together and celebrate each other just as much as the game.”
