Walking, cycling and scooting along Alfriston Drive in Buderim is a much-improved experience thanks to a $280,000 upgrade funded by Sunshine Coast Council and the Australian Government.

A new two-metre wide, 1.2 kilometre-longconcrete pathway has been built on the southern side of Alfriston Drive from Karawatha Street through to Golf Links Road.

Divisional Councillor Christian Dickson said locals were loving the new pathway.

“Safety is always council’s top priority and having a wide, smooth pathway to travel along makes for a much easier journey,” Cr Dickson said.

“It’s great to see so many people already taking advantage of the upgrade. Getting out and about on pathways can provide both a physical and mental boost to your health.

“If you haven’t already checked it out, I encourage you to do so. It’s a welcome addition to our Division 6 infrastructure.

“This project is another great example of council working in partnership with other levels of government to benefit our community.”

The upgrade was made possible thanks to $100,000 from Sunshine Coast Council and $180,000 from the Australian Government’s Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program.

Federal Member for Fairfax, Ted O’Brien MP recently inspected the pathway with Councillor Dickson.

“I’m proud that the Federal Government is able to allocate money for these types of projects that really help people where it counts, in their own neighbourhoods,” Mr O’Brien said.

“While my focus is usually on big infrastructure projects like upgrades to the Bruce Highway, the North Coast Rail and the Airport, smaller projects like this hold a special significance for local communities.

“When you see the pathway being used by a mum pushing a pram, a senior with a walker or little kids riding their bikes, it’s a reminder about the importance of goof local infrastructure.”

Mr O’Brien said he was glad to assist the Sunshine Coast Council to secure almost $15 million worth of Federal funding (phase 1 and 2) through the local Roads and Infrastructure Program.

Council encourages everyone to ‘share the path’ when out and about, act responsibly and be aware of others.

**SHARE THE PATH TIPS**

*   Keep Left – Pass Right (to educate pedestrians which side to pass on)
*   Give Way with a Smile (to encourage politeness)
*   Slow Down and Cruise (to slow down riders when passing walkers)
*   Lead by Example (to reinforce that dogs should be on a tight lead)
*   Make the Right Call (to encourage bike riders to call out or ring their bell)
