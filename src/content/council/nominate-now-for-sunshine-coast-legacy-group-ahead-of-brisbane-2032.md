Expressions of Interest are now open for Sunshine Coast residents to be part of one of our region’s most important groups in the lead-up to the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Sunshine Coast Council recently announced the establishment of the [Sunshine Coast Legacy Plan Community Reference Group](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Community-to-guide-Sunshine-Coast-legacy-from-the-Brisbane-2032-Olympic-and-Paralympic-Games)
&#x20;which will help shape the region’s legacy plan arising from council being a key delivery partner in the 2032 Games.

The Community Reference Group – to be chaired by two-time Paralympian and USC Public Health Lecturer Dr Bridie Kean – will work with council to identify key opportunities the region should pursue before, during and after the Games.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged the community to [apply now](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Events/Olympics2032/Olympic-reference-group)
&#x20;for a community-based voluntary position on the Community Reference Group, as applications will close on Thursday, February 10.

“The Sunshine Coast has an incredible opportunity to create a lasting legacy that will benefit our community, our children and our children’s children for decades to come,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This will be a collaborative partnership to develop a clear plan from which our community – our residents now and those who will live here in the future – will be the clear beneficiaries.

“Behind the excitement and cheers for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games will lie a legacy-driven focus anchored in sustainability, connectivity and liveability for our region.”

Community Reference Group Chair Dr Bridie Kean urged people not to delay and submit an EOI today.

“The Sunshine Coast is made up of some incredibly talented people who have a lot to offer, especially when it comes to influencing the outcomes from the greatest sporting event on Earth,” Dr Kean said.

“This is an amazing opportunity where collectively, the Community Reference Group can provide a powerful voice for our Sunshine Coast that captures ideas, hopes and aspirations from a variety of backgrounds, industries and sectors.”

• Tourism\
• Community sector\
