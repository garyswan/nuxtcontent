Local community groups with project ideas to make the Sunshine Coast more active, vibrant, creative, inclusive or resilient are invited to register for a free 90-minute grant writing online webinar or in person workshop between July 26 – August 4.

Participants will have the opportunity to meet council’s grants officers and learn their top 10 tips for grant writing success.

Each session will explore how to plan and communicate projects, what supporting documentation to include, and provide guidance on how to complete project budgets.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged community groups to book in via council’s website to secure their spot.

“Participation in the funding workshops can build the capacity of community groups to develop projects which will make a difference and increase their chance of application success,” Cr Law said.

“The sessions have been designed to be as interactive as possible. There is opportunity to participate in activities and ask council's grants officers questions.”

More than $500,000 in funding is up for grabs in the latest Major Grants round, which is now open and closes on August 29.

Eligible not-for-profit organisations can receive up to $15,000 for one-off projects, events and activities that meet community need and provide community benefit.

Grants of up to $30,000 are also available for infrastructure projects that involve developing, maintaining or improving buildings or land that contribute to providing a safe, accessible and inclusive community facility.  

Major Grant applications can be submitted in one of six categories: 

*   Community Development
*   Community Facilities
*   Creative Development
*   Cultural Heritage
*   Economic Development
*   Sports and Recreation.

**Key dates:**

*   Round open: July 18, 2022

*   Round close: August 29, 2022

*   Grant writing workshops and webinars: 26 July – 4 August, 2022 –
