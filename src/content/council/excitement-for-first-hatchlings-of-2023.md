EGGciting times!!! Our Sunshine Coast hatchlings have begun emerging from their nest under the sand and making their way to the ocean!

The first little heads poked through their nest under the sand at Buddina beach on Thursday (February 2, 2023) evening!

This video is from a clutch that hatched on Saturday (February 4, 2023) morning.

Thank-you to our expert TurtleCare volunteers for sending it to us! We share your excitement.

Our TurtleCare volunteers are highly trained citizen scientists who make an incredible contribution to the ongoing survival of critically endangered turtles by monitoring nesting mothers, relocating nests if necessary for hatchling survival, and providing essential data to support the protection of habitat of these majestic animals.

#### **HOW YOU CAN HELP DURING TURTLE SEASON**

Report turtle tracks, new nests and emerging hatchlings to our Turtle Care hotline or Coolum and North Shore Coast Care.

For sightings on the southern end of the coast call 0437 559 067 and for sightings from Mooloolaba north call Coolum and North Shore Coast Care on 0478 435 377.

Switch off your outside lights from 8pm as light pollution is distracting for turtles and hatchlings.

Make sure you take your rubbish with you from the beach so the turtles have a clean environment to lay their eggs in.

All TurtleCare activities are conducted under Queensland Turtle Conservation Project permits.
