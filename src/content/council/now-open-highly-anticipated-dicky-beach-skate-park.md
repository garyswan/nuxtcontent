Calling all skaters, BMXers and scooter riders, the new Dicky Beach Skate Park has been completed ahead of schedule and open for community use from Friday 20 August.

Construction will continue over the next few weeks on the ‘finishing touches’ to the new public amenities building and landscaping works.

The public amenities and full car park is expected to be reopen by mid September as originally planned. The Stage 1 area will be officially opened by council in mid-September.

Council would like to thank the community, with special mention to adjacent businesses and residents, for your cooperation and patience during construction.

A big thank you to the community members who participated in community engagement activities to inform the skate park design and overall precinct plan.
