Our region’s plan for protecting our environment and delivering a liveable Sunshine Coast has been recognised as a finalist in the world’s longest running sustainability awards.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS) will compete for the 2020 Banksia Government Awards on March 24, 2021

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was delighted to see council’s integrated and proactive approach to regional planning and sustainability acknowledged at this level.

“Our Environment and Liveability Strategy is a long-term plan to maintain the liveability of our region and build on our outstanding environmental credentials,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This nomination is on the back of Sunshine Coast Council winning the Banksia Government Awards in 2019 for the Mary Cairncross BioBlitz.

“Our strategy exemplifies our region’s forward thinking and real actions to plan for and manage growth as we respond to the impacts of a changing climate.

“What our ELS also seeks to do is take advantage of opportunities today, while looking ahead to 2041 and beyond, to create a legacy that will benefit our community for many years.

“It focuses on preserving and enhancing the Sunshine Coast’s natural environment and enabling a good quality of life for all residents in an accessible and well-connected built environment.

“Our ELS has already played an important role in guiding the achievement of a number of significant outcomes for our community.

“These include launching our Australian-first Blue Heart partnership to protect and manage the most critical areas of the Maroochy River floodplain; progressing a UNESCO Biosphere nomination to recognise our region’s sustainability internationally; developing a Coastal Hazard Adaptation Strategy to proactively manage emerging risks; and expanding our green spaces by securing more land for conservation and recreation, just to name a few.

“The ELS and the actions that come out of it, support our council’s vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative, and also strongly aligns with the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are key criteria in judging the Banksia Sustainability Awards.

“By planning ahead, understanding the emerging risks, and making sustainable choices at the right time, our region can look forward to a healthy, resilient and sustainable future.”

Together with our Regional Economic Development Strategy and our Community Strategy, the ELS provides a comprehensive policy framework to guide and shape the future of the Sunshine Coast.

The key objectives of the Environment and Liveability Strategy are to:

*   maintain and nurture our natural environment
*   effectively manage and cater for population growth
*   build resilience against the potential impacts of climate change
*   create liveable spaces and places to live, work and play
*   drive renewable energy, efficiency and technical know-how
*   live up to the expectations of future generations.
