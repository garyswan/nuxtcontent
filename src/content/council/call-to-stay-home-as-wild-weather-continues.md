This morning’s severe storms have significantly impacted Landsborough and Beerwah on the Sunshine Coast, causing extensive damage.

Energex is attending to at least 80 fallen powerlines which are on the ground, caught in trees and cutting access.

Authorities are greatly concerned about the danger this poses, telling people to stay in their homes and not to drive through the area.

Large hail has also caused damage to homes, heavy rain has caused flash flooding and high winds have caused trees to fall.

Council crews and arborists, Energex, Queensland Police Service, Queensland Fire and Rescue, SES and Rural Fire Service are onsite to manage traffic, clear debris, clear and restore powerlines, and assist residents and make the area safe until the storms have passed. 

Impacted roads include Steve Irwin Way, Old Landsborough Rd, Old Gympie Rd, Pinelands Rd and Whites Rd. With several roads closed and powerlines down, council and emergency services are encouraging residents to stay off the roads, where possible.

Telstra towers are affected and is working to restore communications.

Sunshine Coast Council has urged residents to stay safe and remain vigilant as flood warnings have again been issued for the Maroochy River, Mooloolah River and Coochin Creek.

The Conondale community should remain on high alert, as flash flooding in the upper Mary River is possible.

It comes as much of south east Queensland was battered by severe weather again this morning, with thunderstorms set to continue across the Sunshine Coast today.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson said with the ground already soaked and waterways still swollen after last week’s deluge, the continued heavy rainfall was dangerous and had the potential to cause flash flooding.

“There is a lot of water on the roads so if you don’t need to be driving, please don’t,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“An emergency alert has been issued and I ask people to follow its messaging, primarily about staying off the roads.

“It is not worth the risk and, remember, if it’s flooded, forget it.

“The Bureau of Meteorology has advised more severe weather may be on the way so we need to be prepared and know where we can get help.

“Please monitor the information being put out by emergency services.

“I encourage everyone to download the Bureau of Meteorology app on your phone or mobile device. You can view the radar and receiving flood and severe thunderstorm warnings, flood watch and hazardous surf warnings.

“Council crews and emergency service personnel are doing a terrific job assisting the community and keeping us safe.

“I thank them for their hard work and dedication as this prolonged weather event continues.”

A Hazardous Surf Warning has been issued for Sunshine Coast waters with surf and swell conditions expected to be hazardous along the Coast from early Friday morning through to Saturday.

Surf Life Saving Queensland advise that people should stay out of the water.
