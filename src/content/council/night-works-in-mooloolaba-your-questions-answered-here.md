Council is committed to providing and maintaining infrastructure to service the needs of our region, which includes keeping our communities connected.

As part of this, some road resurfacing works will be undertaken along bustling Mooloolaba Esplanade, Mooloolaba, to replace the pavement and asphalt wearing surface.

The works will be taking place at night, but don’t worry they aren’t scheduled to interrupt your evening weekend plans!

This renewal is essential to improve safety for road users and allow residents, visitors and businesses a smoother and safer transit along this section of the iconic precinct.

For more information about this project and how it benefits you, please read our Frequently Asked Questions below relating to parking, detours, bus stops and noise.

### Where are the works occurring?

Works will occur in the northbound and southbound lanes of Mooloolaba Esplanade, Mooloolaba, along the section of road between Venning Street and Buderim Avenue.

Refer to the light blue section highlighted on the aerial map below.

### What are the construction timelines for the project?

*   **Duration:** Works will occur from Sunday, July 16, to Friday, July 28, 2023 (weather and site conditions permitting).
*   **Night works:** Works will occur at night from Sunday through to Thursday during each of the two weeks. There will be **no** works planned on Friday and Saturday evenings.
*   **Shift window:** Works will occur within the shift window from 6pm through to 6am.
*   **Possible extension:** Potential wet weather conditions may extend the duration of the works program.

Council will aim to deliver the noisiest components of the work prior to midnight (12am).

Council apologises for any inconvenience, and we assure the community that every attempt will be made to minimise disruption where possible.

Works will be scheduled in an attempt to ensure the road can be reopened at the conclusion of each night shift, to allow regular traffic access during the day.

### What can residents and motorists expect during the works?

Works will include profiling and asphalt works, incorporating heavy plant and considerable truck movements. Profiling includes the use of a milling machine, bobcats, jack hammering and trucks to remove deteriorated or aged pavement which will occur at night, to facilitate day use of carparking area.

Council will make every effort to minimise impacts, however, this is a major rehabilitation project and some disturbance is unavoidable.  The noisiest components of the night works will occur in the early part of the evening in an attempt to minimise disruption to nearby residents and visitors.  

Throughout the project there will be changes to traffic conditions (temporary lane closures, traffic and pedestrian pathway changes and stop-go traffic control), increased heavy vehicle movements, construction noise, signage and road barriers will be in place to help redirect motorists and pedestrians.

Dust mitigation measures will be in place. Signage will help to communicate information about alternative car parking.

### What access restrictions will be in place?

Road users are asked to follow traffic controllers and roadside signage when temporary road closure detours are in place.

Residents and visitors will be able to access businesses and side streets, however short delays may occur while machinery is in operation; drivers are encouraged to allow extra travel time for transit through the area.

Douglas Street and Goonawarra Drive are expected to be used as detour access roads, as well as several other close connecting streets.

Residents and visitors are asked to inform traffic controllers if access is required for special health and welfare services.

Electronic multi-message boards are in place at various locations approaching the works area, advising and redirecting vehicles and pedestrian traffic while works are underway.

### What changes will be made to bus stop locations?

Changes will be made to some local bus stops for safety reasons, to relocate passenger pick-up and drop-off locations between the work hours of 6pm to 5am.

Stops that will be affected include Mooloolaba Esplanade at Meta Street (North and South).  The nearest alternative stop is Alexandra Parade at Alexandra Headland (five-minute walk to the north along Mooloolaba Esplanade).

Check for notices and updates at bus stop points or contact Translink on 13 12 30.

### What is Council doing to minimise the impact of noise?

Council will aim to deliver the noisiest components of the work prior to 12am (midnight). Other noise mitigation measures will be in place to minimise impacts to neighbouring properties.

Safety legislation requires Council and contractors to use machinery with reversing beepers and other warning systems that produce noise.

Council recognises the noise and repetitive sounds from machinery may cause frustration and annoyance among residents, particularly during the evenings.

Council appreciates the community’s patience and understanding as this beneficial project is advanced.

### Why weren’t these works scheduled to be delivered during the day?

These works require a roads permit from the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) since the project is occurring near or adjacent to a main road. The conditions of the permit prevent Council from delivering this project during the day because of the potential impact to traffic on other nearby roads.

### Why are the works scheduled over a two-week timeframe?

The decision was made to deliver the works in July to coincide with typically drier weather conditions which are more favourable to on-time delivery of uninterrupted road works schedules.

Council identified it was necessary to schedule these works outside of school holidays to minimise disruption to visitors, local businesses and planned major events.

Council acknowledges these works are coinciding with other ongoing infrastructure upgrades occurring concurrently in the Mooloolaba area, and we appreciate temporary disruption or inconvenience may be experienced by residents, businesses and visitors to the precinct.

### Where else can I park?

On-street parking near the works area on Mooloolaba Esplanade, Mooloolaba, will not be available from 6pm to 6am while works are in progress. Property access will be reinstated at the end of each night shift.

Road users and residents should seek to park vehicles on another street or in off-street car parks. Please note that parking on a bicycle path, footpath, shared path or dividing strip, or nature strip may result in a parking infringement being issued in accordance with the council’s Local Laws. Council has control of the roads in its region under section 60 of the Local Government Act. If a vehicle is found in the road works area during the times outlined in this notification, the vehicle will be towed away in accordance with the council’s Local Laws. Council has control of the roads in its region under section 60 of the Local Government Act.

### How has Council informed the community of the project?

Kerb and channel preparation works for this project were delivered in May 2023. Prior to these preparation works, a public notification was delivered to local residents and properties which also informed the community about additional road resurfacing works that would be taking place in July 2023.

In June, Council engaged with emergency services and transport providers to inform them about the works at Mooloolaba Esplanade, which is part of Council business operations to announce temporary changes to road access or detours.

On June 12, 2023, Council issued the works notification via email to businesses, accommodation providers, property managers, service operators, and major organisations with a presence in the Mooloolaba area.

One week prior to the works commencing, hard-copy printed notifications were delivered to properties around the works area.

Five days prior to works commencing, email correspondence was issued to 3,500 property owners in the Mooloolaba area.
