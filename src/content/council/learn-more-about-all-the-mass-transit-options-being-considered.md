So many have already made their way to one of the [Mass Transit pop-up displays](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Have-Your-Say)
 to learn more about the [mass transit options](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Mass-Transit-Options)
 being considered as a possible solution to move people around our region.

Until 22 June 2021, Sunshine Coast residents and visitors can provide their feedback on a range of options being considered in the [draft Mass Transit Options Analysis report](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Document-Library)
.

There are several options being considered to help meet the transport needs along one of the busiest stretches of the Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore to Caloundra.

The [mass transit options](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Mass-Transit-Options)
 include:

*   **Business as usual** – no changes to be made
*   **Road network upgrades** – road upgrades in the coastal corridor which would benefit all users including buses
*   **Region-wide bus service enhancements** – new and existing routes with improved frequency, more direct routes and better connections
*   **Region-wide bus network** **upgrades** – supported by key bus infrastructure such as improved shelters, sections of bus priority lanes and park ‘n’ ride facilities
*   **Quality bus corridor** – a high-frequency bus service running in dedicated kerbside bus priority lanes with features such as high-quality vehicles, pre-paid boarding and quality bus stops
*   **Bus rapid transit** – 25 metre-long battery-powered, rubber tyred vehicles running at high frequency in a dedicated busway corridor mostly in the centre of the road with high-quality stations, pre-paid boarding and priority signalling
*   **Light rail transit** - 45 metre long modern rail vehicles running at high frequency on a dedicated trackway mostly in the centre of the road with high-quality stations, pre-paid boarding and priority signalling
*   **Trackless tram** - 32 metre long battery powered rubber tyred 'tram like' vehicles running at high frequency in a dedicated busway corridor mostly in the centre of the road with high-quality stations, pre-paid boarding and priority signalling
*   **Wire-free light rail system (wLRT)** - identical to the light rail option, without the overhead wires, with on-board batteries and charging equipment at select stations.

Deputy Mayor and Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said community input was so important in determining the best mass transit options for our region.

“Community feedback received about the draft report and the survey will help to refine the options that will be most suited to our local area and Sunshine Coast character,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Then these recommendations will be assessed further during the final phase of the business case process – the Detailed Business Case. 

“The detailed business case will then decide the best option for the local area and whether the project can viably proceed or not.

“At this options stage, we do not have a preferred transport type, which is why we are asking you to think about how you will make your way around the region, not just today but critically well into the future.

“I’m pleased with the interest the community has shown with many people attending the pop-ups to share their ideas on the draft report so far.

“I encourage everyone of us to get involved, either online or by attending the wide range of community engagement events at local markets, libraries and shopping centres.”

The outcomes of the community and stakeholder feedback about the mass transit options will inform the finalised Mass Transit Options Analysis report, which will be considered by council later this year. Subject to council’s agreement, the finalised report will be sent to the State Government for consideration and further assessment as the basis for the next phase of the business case process – the Detailed Business Case.

     on public transport options before June 22, 2021.

Mass transit is a convenient and easy-to-access public transport system which moves people efficiently.

A well-designed system reduces car use, especially at peak times, and may include:

*   buses, including articulated and double decker buses
*   trams or light rail vehicles
*   passenger trains.
