Sunshine Coast Council residents must continue to keep COVID-19 front of mind and continue to comply with amended public health directions announced by the Queensland Chief Health Officer on Sunday, 8 August 2021.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said although lockdown had lifted, everyone had a shared responsibility to do their part to help stop the spread.

“I thank those members of our community who have been doing such a great job throughout the latest lockdown to help to keep our community safe,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Doing the right thing and looking out for each other has helped bring this lockdown to an end.

“But the virus remains an ever-present threat and none of us can afford to be complacent.

“It remains absolutely critical to observe the requirements so we can lessen the likelihood of a further outbreak of the Delta Variant of the COVID-19 virus.

“So, please, if you haven’t done so already, make arrangements to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

“Continue to wear a mask when required, practise good hygiene and remember to socially distance 1.5 metres.

“Critically, if you have any symptoms – no matter how minor – get tested immediately and stay at home until you receive your results and at all times, follow the Queensland Health directions.

“Do not wait if you have any symptoms – get tested straight away.  If you are unsure if you have symptoms of COVID-19, err on the side of caution and get tested.

“Everyone is also being asked to consider if any travel is essential and limit travel outside the 11 Local Government Areas of south east Queensland in line with the Queensland Health directive.

“And don’t forget, when you’re out and about, it’s vital to check-in when visiting premises using the Check-in app.

“By following these requirements and working together, we are all doing our bit to keep our community safe.”
