Horizon Festival, one of the most anticipated events on the Sunshine Coast calendar, is back in 2022 and presenting in person for the first time since 2019.

The 10-day multi-arts festival will be held across the Sunshine Coast from August 26 to September 4.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the 10-day festival was a highlight of Council’s cultural, arts and events calendar and a key Council deliverable to achieve the vision of the Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018 – 2038.

“For 10 days and nights, the rich and diverse program will provide hundreds of unique arts experiences,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Festival-goers can look forward to visual art, cultural connection, theatre, dance, words and ideas alongside a variety of performing arts right across the Sunshine Coast.

“Horizon Festival celebrates local artists, alongside global artists, to bring us creative experiences that showcase the stories and beauty of our region.”

While the full festival program is under wraps until June 16, Sunshine Coast Council’s Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold said she was excited to announce the ‘Homegrown’ artists a little earlier this year.

“’Homegrown’ is an initiative we present in partnership with the Regional Arts Development Fund and has grown since its first iteration in 2020,” Ms Clissold said.

“The program is a platform for local artists to extend and develop their practice, ultimately presenting the work in the festival.

“The quality of applications this year was stronger than ever before, which is so exciting as it speaks volumes to the talent here in the region.

“We are thrilled to formally announce the following three successful artists, with their work featured as part of the official festival program:

*   Dr Hope O’Chin (Aunty Hope) will present ‘Guyu and My friend Mr Pelican’. Aunty Hope will read her beautiful story ‘Guyu and friend Mr Pelican’ to students followed by a participatory workshop, exploring Kabi-Kabi language.
*   Courtney Scheu and Itamar Freed  will present the premier performance of ‘Sand’. Sand is a study of the relationship between body and landscape and the impacts each has on the other.
*   Kerbside Collective present ‘Eddie Ray - Silence of the Jams’, an epic independent comic film accompanied by live band exploring a visual manifestation of the artist's journey when all is lost. 

“These three works are not to be missed, and we encourage people to save the festival dates in their calendars now – and keep an eye out for the full program launch next month.”

Homegrown is supported by the Queensland Government through Arts Queensland’s Open Air program, Queensland Arts Showcase Program, and the Regional Arts Development Fund, a partnership between the Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council to support local arts and culture in regional Queensland.
