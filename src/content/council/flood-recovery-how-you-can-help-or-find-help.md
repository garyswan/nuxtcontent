WASTE REMINDER - TIP FEES WAIVED: Until close of business Sunday March 13, 2022 we are offering free general and food waste disposal to residents impacted by flooding.

GARDEN WASTE: Unfortunately our garden waste storage areas are full and we are unable to receive large volumes of garden waste at this time.

We are doing our utmost to receive greater volumes and thank you for your patience. We’ll keep our community updated and let you know when we can accept green waste.

In the short-term please store garden waste on your property until we decrease the current stocks at our transfer stations.
