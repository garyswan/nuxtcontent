Sunshine Coast Council today (October 6) partnered with Queensland Health’s Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service to encourage residents to get their COVID-19 vaccination.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said vaccination is our ticket to a safer future, our best defence in the fight against COVID-19.

“The sooner our community is vaccinated, the greater the likelihood that we can start to move on from the impacts of this pandemic on our jobs, our families and many of the things we enjoy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Undoubtedly COVID-19 has turned our lives upside down.

“But now is the time for us to come together as a community and “get the jab done” for our own benefit and for the good of the whole community, especially our most vulnerable.

“Once our community is vaccinated, borders are more likely to stay open, our region is less likely to be exposed to the risk of lockdowns and friends and relatives are more likely to be able to visit from interstate and overseas.

“So please, if you haven’t already done so, now is the time to get your COVID-19 vaccine.

“With Queensland Health opening a clinic at Council’s Caloundra Indoor Stadium from this Friday, October 8, the timing couldn’t be more perfect.

“There are also other options available to get vaccinated, through participating general practitioners and pharmacies”.

Mayor Jamieson said he was deeply appreciative of the Sunshine Coast residents who had already received their vaccinations or registered.

“What could be more important than the health of our community? Please continue to share your vaccination selfies online and talk to your friends and family about getting vaccinated.”

“So come on, Sunshine Coast. Let’s get the jab done.”
