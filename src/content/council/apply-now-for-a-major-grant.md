Sunshine Coast community groups with great project ideas to make the region more active, vibrant, inclusive, resilient or creative are urged to apply for a Major Grant through Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Grants program.

More than $500,000 in funding is up for grabs in the latest Major Grants round, which is now open and applications close on March 14.

In the last council Major Grant round for this financial year, eligible not-for-profit organisations can receive up to $15,000 for projects, events and activities that meet community need and provide community benefit.

Grants up to $30,000 are also available for infrastructure projects that involve developing, maintaining or improving buildings or land that contribute to providing a safe, accessible and inclusive community facility.  

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law called on community groups to apply for a grant in one of the six categories.

“The program acknowledges and strengthens the invaluable contribution community groups and their volunteers make towards achieving our shared vision and goal of being Australia's most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative and fostering a strong community,” Cr Law said.

“Thank you to all of the community groups who provided feedback on the Community Grants Program last year.

“Improvements to simplify the language in the Program Guidelines will be rolled out incrementally, over the coming year.

“Don’t delay, help us support your community group’s important projects, by applying for a Major Grant today.”

*   Major Grant applications can be submitted in one of six categories: 

    *   Community Development
    *   Community Facilities
    *   Creative Development
    *   Cultural Heritage
    *   Economic Development
    *   Sports, Recreation and Healthy Living.

*   Major Grant applicants can apply for up to $15,000 (and $30,000 for infrastructure projects in the Community Facilities category only).

*   Environment Levy Grants up to $5000 are also now open and available to not-for-profit community organisations for projects that make a positive and ongoing contribution to the region's biodiversity and waterways.
