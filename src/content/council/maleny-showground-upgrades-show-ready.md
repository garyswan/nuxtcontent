This year’s Maleny Show on 28 and 29 May has a new show-stopping look following the completion of a $1.4 million upgrade to infrastructure and facilities to cater for the crowds who are expected to flock to the Show once more.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the renewed facilities meant the showgrounds could continue to cater for crowd-favourite events.

“Usually the smells, sounds and sights of country life are the main attractions when you enter the gates, but I think our facility upgrades won’t go unnoticed this year,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“For 84 years, patrons have been rolling through the Maleny Showground gates to celebrate and come together as a community at the Show.

“Our Council has contributed nearly $400,000 to this upgrade in partnership, with contributions from both the Federal Government, Queensland Government and Maleny Show Society, which I think the community will warmly welcome.

“To make it easier for vehicles to access the showgrounds, council has upgraded the gravel roads around the two main fields to asphalt and constructed an exit road from the grounds to ease congestion.

“The Pavilion, which caters for many trade shows, has been fitted out with solar panels producing an estimated 157,352 kWh – that’s equivalent to powering more than 320 medium-sized household fridges for a year!

“It’s sustainable upgrades like this to public facilities, which support our vision of being Australia’s most sustainable region - healthy, smart creative.”

Patrons will also notice the reconstructed amenities building behind the Secretary’s Office, which includes unisex toilets and basins, a change room and cubicle, and an all abilities cubicle and shower.

Maleny Showgrounds new amenities.

A pathway has also been installed from the amenities to the disability parking space and a further two concrete car parks have been provided. 

The Federal Government provided $534,722 to the Maleny Show Society which also provided an additional $325,000 of their own funds for these projects. These contributions supported the upgrade to the amenities and delivered the extension of the Secretary’s Office and construction of a large storage facility.

Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management David Littleproud said he was heartened to see the Maleny Show prospering through the adversity of COVID and the associated economic hardships.

“We want to see the 84-year tradition continuing and the community exhibiting the fruits of their labour at the Show,” Minister Littleproud said.

“Country shows are important lynch pins for country towns and everyone in the community thrives off the back of those shows.”  

Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning Steven Miles said the Queensland Government invested $200,000 to this upgrade through the State’s COVID Works for Queensland program.

“Our COVID Works for Queensland program is delivering 519 projects that will support more than 4,600 jobs across the state,” Mr Miles said.

“It’s projects like the Maleny Showground upgrade that improve local community infrastructure and create local jobs.”

Division 5 Councillor and Maleny Show Society President Winston Johnston said it was really exciting to see the upgrades delivered in time for this year’s show.

“We are expecting a crowd of more than 6000 to support our local traders and to revel in this year’s new attractions.

“In our main ring, we will host not one but two nights of entertainment, with crowd favourite monster trucks and a finale of fireworks.

“I would also like to acknowledge that Agricultural Shows such as Maleny’s would not be successful without the tireless work of local volunteers who provide so much of their time to make the show a success for all who visit and compete.

“I also recommend that everyone make sure they take the opportunity to support one of our renowned heritage events while enjoying a great day out at Maleny Show.”

Council is encouraging the community to keep our community COVID-Safe, limit contact where possible, and make entry quicker by pre-purchasing their tickets online at the [Maleny Show website](https://malenyshowsociety.org.au/2021-show/)
.

The community is encouraged to maintain social distancing, wash hands often and stay home if you’re unwell and get tested if you have any COVID symptoms.

Parking on site will be very limited so visitors are encouraged to make use of free shuttle buses from the Maleny Historical Village and Maleny High School running from 8am until late. Some parking spaces for people with a disability are available on site at the showgrounds.

The Maleny Show is on Friday and Saturday 28-29 May. Tickets to the Maleny Show start from $5 for children and $15 for adults. For more information visit [www.malenyshowsociety.org.au/2021-show](http://www.malenyshowsociety.org.au/2021-show)
