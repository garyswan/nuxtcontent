In the 28 years since Council’s Customer Service counter in Caloundra opened at Omrah Avenue, more than 300 staff have helped over half a million Sunshine Coast residents.

Caloundra’s Customer Service Centre is now moving to a new location, heralding the start of an exciting development.

From Monday March 20, you’ll find the helpful Customer Service crew relocated a short stroll away at 77 Bulcock Street, Caloundra.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the Customer Service counter move and refurbishment was the start of something big for the area.

“Repurposing the Omrah Avenue administration building will allow council to cater for our growing Caloundra population,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Once renovated, levels one and two of the administration building will be home to a [new district library](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Caloundra-CBD-Project/cal-library)
&#x20;a new customer service centre, community meeting spaces and covered outdoor areas.

“The upper level of the building will provide community venue space and staff administration offices.

“This facility will be the first contemporary library for the Sunshine Coast Local Government area in more than 20 years and will meet the highest environment and sustainable standards.

“Upon completion, approximately 150 council staff will continue to work from the new district library and community building.

“This Community and Creative Hub has a strong focus on good quality urban design outcomes, improved park and streetscape spaces that link to Bulcock Beach and connect the new library, The Events Centre and future new regional gallery.

“The precinct will be managed in stages and delivered over the coming years.

“The project will boost investment confidence and establish Caloundra as a leading business employment, cultural and community service hub and act as a catalyst for private investment in the Caloundra centre.

“The refurbishment of the Omrah Avenue administration building is expected to start in mid-2023.

“The new library and community building is scheduled to open its doors to the community and staff in early 2025, weather and site conditions permitting.

“This temporary move of Caloundra’s Customer Service Centre is the first step in seeing this exciting project come to fruition.”

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said the new location would continue to service Sunshine Coast residents.

“It’s important that our customers still get the council support and information they need throughout the move and renovation,’’ Cr Dickson said.

“We appreciate that some people prefer to visit us in person, so we’ve made sure the new Caloundra Customer Service Counter is easy to find and only a short stroll from Omrah Avenue, through Felicity Park, past the Caloundra library, to Bulcock Street.”
