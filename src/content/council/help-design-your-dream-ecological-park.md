Residents are encouraged to have their say on plans for Sunshine Coast Council’s 65 hectare ecological park adjoining Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve before community consultation closes on Friday (May 27).

It follows the project’s [Expert Advisory Panel](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Ecological-Park)
’s recent formation, led by well-known urban designer Cathryn Chatburn and featuring a diverse group of experts and visionaries including John Mainwaring, BJ Murphy, Angela Wright, Alan Hoban, Spencer Shaw, John Wright and Ella Woodborne.

The proposed Sunshine Coast Ecological Park is an exciting and important project, aligning with council’s commitment to grow our green spaces for generations to come.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the ball was well and truly rolling with the project’s three-part community consultation process underway.

“We’re now in an exciting and creative part of planning where we get to imagine what our dream ecological park would look like and hopefully make that come to life,” Cr Suarez said.\
“This will be a park for both Sunshine Coast locals and visitors, so we’d like to hear from everyone.

“We want to know what facilities and aspects of a park are important to you through an [online questionnaire](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sc-eco-park-master-plan)
, with questions relating to the park’s six established values.

“We’d also like to know how important it is to you to have spaces and facilities such as picnic tables and shelters where you can hold celebrations with loved ones or spaces to support performance and interactive creative art activities.

“You’ll be asked to rate how strongly you agree with ensuring the park has more accessible green spaces for our growing population, and corridors to support the movement of wildlife.”

Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said all feedback gathered through the survey would be taken onboard as council moved into Stage 2 of the consultation process to test and refine the ideas.

“Stage 2 is due to kick-off in mid-2022 and we will enter Stage 3 in early 2023 when we will present the Draft Master Plan for public comment,” Cr Johnston said.

To have your say on the proposed park, visit council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sc-eco-park-master-plan)
.

The survey closes 5pm, Friday, May 27.
