Our skate culture has come a long way. Gone are the days in the 1970s when we were dropping into abandoned swimming pools…fast forward to this September and Sunshine Coast locals should be hugging the rail on our precision-built skate park in the heart of Caloundra.

Skaters, BMXers and scooter riders will soon see their skate park design become reality with Sunshine Coast Council beginning construction on a new Dicky Beach concrete playscape in early March.

As part of the Dicky Beach Precinct Plan, stage 1 works will reflect the SS Dicky wreck’s significance to the local area and include open spaces and much needed community facilities to create a welcoming experience for the locals and visitors coming to the area.

Divisional councillor Terry Landsberg said many people in the community provided valuable feedback in 2019 to help shape the Dicky Beach Precinct Plan and new skate park.

“It’s great to reach the construction phase of this project and see that valuable local input become a reality for our community,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Once constructed, the skate park will provide a great facility for people of all ages and skate abilities to enjoy.

“It will include features such as ramps, rails, grind ledges, quarter pipes, stairs, plus more! There will also be shaded seating and spectator areas to watch all the action from.”

The Dicky Beach Precinct Plan will also better connect the park area with local businesses, Holiday Park, beach and surf lifesaving club house – a precinct shaping our region as healthy, smart and creative.

The upgrade includes a new public amenities, picnic shelter and pathways, beach showers, park lighting, furniture such as seating, drinking fountain, bike parking, bins and landscaping.

“As well as the community led skate park, council is also improving disability parking so this soon to be revitalised area can be accessed by everyone in our community,” Cr Landsberg said.

“I’m also really excited that the SS Dicky propeller will be reinstated to highlight our history.

“During the construction period, the existing 20-year-old skate park will be closed while it is demolished to make way for the new one, which is expected to be finished in early

September, dependent on weather and site conditions.

“I thank you for your patience during this time and I look forward to providing progress updates throughout construction, as I’m sure many of us are eager to see the new-look.”
