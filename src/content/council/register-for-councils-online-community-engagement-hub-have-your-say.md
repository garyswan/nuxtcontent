Sunshine Coast residents wanting to have their voice heard on key council projects are being encouraged to [register online](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or update their profile on council’s community engagement hub in order to receive important updates.

Have Your Say is Sunshine Coast Council’s online community engagement hub. It gives our community the opportunity to provide valuable information, feedback and ideas on a range of council projects and activities.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said speaking up on council plans and projects helped to make decisions that benefit our whole community.

“Providing your feedback and ideas helps to build strong and connected communities,” Cr Law said.

“There are a number of projects currently available for your input and there will be more to come.

“By registering, you will be provided updates on the consultation process and be invited to take part in other community consultations – simply add your preferences when registering.”

Council is currently seeking feedback on the [New Planning Scheme Project](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme)
.

People are encouraged to [register online](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
