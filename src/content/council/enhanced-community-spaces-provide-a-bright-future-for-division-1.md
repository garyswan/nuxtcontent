Vibrant streetscapes, enhanced parks and gardens and sustained management of the region’s waste and recycling are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 1. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said the award-winning multi-stage streetscape project at Landsborough would continue to strongly progress along Cribb Street.\
“This is thanks to a further $1.15 million investment, providing enhanced pedestrian access and community spaces while also enhancing the town’s heritage and character,” Cr Baberowski said.\
“This stage of this transformative and community driven project is funded by council, the State Government and the Caloundra South (Stockland’s Aura) Community Development Infrastructure fund.

“Stage two of the master-planned Turner Park project is also expected to be a major drawcard for Beerwah and encourage healthy and active play to benefit our community with works continuing in 2022-23. “The first stage of the $2.52 million Johnston Road upgrade at Glass House Mountains will start this year with a $520,000 budget injection.\
“This will be followed by a further $2 million to complete the project the following financial year.\
“The division’s truly remarkable network of family friendly parks and gardens will be further enhanced and help to activate many of our hinterland towns with numerous projects rolling out across Division 1, including Little Mountain, Caloundra West, Beerwah and Beerburrum.\
“The community also deeply understands how we need to be even smarter and more innovative when managing our future waste.\
“While reducing the amount of daily rubbish we generate is always the best option for our environment and our ratepayers, council will continue to manage and increase the rate of diversion from our region’s landfill sites with multiple projects scheduled for the Caloundra waste and recycling centre.\
“Council will continue solidly progress to upgrade roads and pathways with an investment of more than $1.1 million across Division 1 in 2022–23.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
