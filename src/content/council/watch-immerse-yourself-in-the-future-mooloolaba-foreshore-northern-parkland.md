Sunshine Coast Council is creating more space along the Mooloolaba Foreshore to make treasured memories with family and friends, better pathways for sunrise walks and more places to enjoy the lifestyle we all love. 

Stage 1 Northern Parkland includes a new viewing platform with seating at the Alex Bluff Foreshore Park, a new accessible boardwalk linking Alexandra Headland and Mooloolaba, new open spaces, barbecue sheltered area and more.

Watch the video now to see how council envisage the space will look in seven to ten years. Please note, artist impressions are indicative only and subject to change.
