Whether you’re an early morning coffee enthusiast or enjoy a morning walk, cycle or drive into Mooloolaba, you should expect some slight changes to Brisbane Road next week.

Construction of the highly anticipated upgrade of Brisbane Road between Walan Street and Kyamba Court, which will see the widening of the corridor to four traffic lanes, is underway.

Sunshine Coast Council Group Executive Liveability and Natural Assets Warren Bunker said the construction would deliver the second and third stages of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade – designed to improve the community’s connectivity and travel choice.

“This important transport project is scheduled for completion in late 2022 and will improve safety and traffic flow, reduce delays during peak periods and cater for future traffic growth in Mooloolaba,” Mr Bunker said.

“Hall Contracting, a locally owned and operated business, is constructing the $24.6 million Brisbane Road upgrade, inclusive of the $12 million Australian Government funding through the $4 billion Urban Congestion Fund.

“Power conduits were installed across Mayes Canal Bridge in June and underground infrastructure will continue to be installed along Brisbane Road as the project continues.

“To minimise disruption, sections of Brisbane Road, between Walan Street and Kyamba Court, will be periodically closed at night.

“Closures will take place periodically between 8pm and 6am, weather permitting.

“The first closure will take place between 11 and 15 July, 8pm and 6am, on a section of Brisbane Road near Mayes Canal Bridge and Kyamba Court, Mooloolaba.

“For a smooth drive into Mooloolaba, follow the alternative route via Amarina Avenue and Goonawarra Drive. This alternative route will add about two minutes to your journey, so please allow additional travel time.

“Access along Brisbane Road will remain available to local residents, staff and customers and traffic controllers will be present during these closures.”

Council will continue to keep the community informed and minimise impacts where possible.
