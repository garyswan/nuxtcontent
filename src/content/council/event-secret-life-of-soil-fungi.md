We all marvel at the rainforest above ground, but what is going on below the surface? Soils are the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet and the main terrestrial carbon sink. The underworld is teeming with life - fungi and other soil microbes are busy as plant caregivers and protectors. Dr. Sandra Tuszynska, a soil microbiologist and mycologist (a fungi scientist) will describe the soil ecosystem with a special focus on fungi and their wondrous mycelium. Learn how you can help restore our dying soils back to life and be blown away by the intelligence beneath your feet!
