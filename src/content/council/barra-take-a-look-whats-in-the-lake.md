Plenty of marine life was spotted in Lake Kawana during a recent ecological survey.

Check out these underwater pictures from the BRUVS\* or baited remote underwater video stations.

### What we learnt:

üåø Seagrass beds in Lake Kawana have grown compared with last year and seem very healthy.

üêü Lots of healthy marine life live under the lake's surface.

### What now?

These annual surveys monitor aquatic life in the lake, including fish and plants, as well as overall health of the system.

This information helps us to make informed decisions when managing this constructed waterbody.

\*Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) is¬†a system used in marine biology research. By attracting fish into the field of view of a remotely controlled camera, the technique records fish diversity, abundance and behaviour of species.
