You could be sitting on a fortune, come along this Saturday and find out.

Want to know if you have treasure in your third drawer or gold in your garage?

Lovers of Antiques Roadshow will love this event, which could unearth something really special.

Caloundra Regional Gallery is hosting free ['Show us your art'](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/adult-programs/show-us-your-art-assessing-your-art-collection/)
&#x20;sessions this Saturday, March 4, 10am-2pm, where you can find out if that 'maybe' masterpiece you've inherited or the Clarice Cliff you picked up at a garage sale is the real deal.

Dust off that 2D artwork, small object (items must be no larger than 1.5 sqm or 10kg) or ceramic piece that you would like to know more about and book in for a free assessment with one of the experts to learn something new about its value and history.
