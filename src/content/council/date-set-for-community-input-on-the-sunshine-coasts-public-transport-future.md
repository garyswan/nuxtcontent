Mark a spot in your calendar. Your chance to have a say on the best public transport options for our region kicks off on 28 April 2021.

Over an eight-week period until 22 June 2021, residents and visitors will have the opportunity to provide their valuable feedback on a range of options being considered in a draft Mass Transit Options Analysis report.

The Options Analysis is the second phase in the business case process being undertaken for the mass transit project.

The options considered in the draft report range from bus network upgrades to a quality bus corridor to bus rapid transit, trackless trams, light rail transit and more.

Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said while public transport was a State Government responsibility, council was leading the important planning work to attract state and federal infrastructure funding and needed community feedback and support to achieve that.

“We know we need sustainable and efficient transport options that can move us around quickly as our population grows yet still protect our local lifestyle and environment,” Cr Baberowski said.

“We are considering a range of options, and we are keen to know your thoughts.”

The outcomes of the community and stakeholder feedback about the mass transit options will inform the finalisation of the Mass Transit Options Analysis report, which will then be submitted to council for consideration.

Cr Baberowski said the comprehensive community engagement process would seek community opinion on a wide range of potential options to help council make recommendations to the State Government for further consideration in the final phase of the mass transit business case process, the Detailed Business Case.

“Make sure you have a say on what you and your family and friends want when it comes to getting around the Sunshine Coast so we can protect our environment and the way we live, work and play” he said.

There will also be the opportunity to have a say about the various ways in which the forecast growth in the coastal corridor could be accommodated over the decades ahead, from medium rise development concentrated around stations and centres to lower density development dispersed more widely throughout the corridor.  

Feedback received about the various ways of accommodating growth will help inform the preparation of the new planning scheme, which is proceeding over the next few years.
