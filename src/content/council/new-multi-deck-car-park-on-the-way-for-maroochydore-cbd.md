Motorists and cyclists will welcome the news today that 350 new car and motorcycle parking spaces will be created in the new Maroochydore city centre with Economic Development Queensland providing planning approval to construct the city centre’s first multi-deck car park.

The car park, to be located on Lightning Lane, adjacent to Foundation Place, will feature 294 car spaces, including accessible parking and electric vehicle charging spaces, 56 motorcycle and 28 bicycle spaces as well as end-of-trip facilities.

End-of-trip facilities will include showers, toilets, PWD facilities, lockers, and a drying cupboard.

The car park building will incorporate sustainability principles including connection to Australia’s first, high technology underground automated waste collection system. It will also include ground level retail spaces.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said this car park was the first of a number of multi-deck car parks planned for the new city centre.

“If you’ve taken a drive around the new Maroochydore city centre recently, you would have seen it’s a bustling hub of construction and business activity,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“With offices, residents and restaurants now enjoying the emerging city centre, providing additional car parking will further support the growing activity in the area.”

The construction contract will be awarded in early 2022.

Walker Corporation will project manage delivery of the multi-deck car park as part of the Maroochydore City Centre Development Agreement.

The multi-deck car park is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2023.

Parking fees will be considered by council at a future council meeting.

The Maroochydore City Centre Priority Development Area is being delivered through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council, SunCentral Maroochydore Pty Ltd and Walker Maroochydore Developments Pty Ltd. The agreement will see up to $2.5 billion of private sector investment flow into the project.
