Community feedback is sought on a new public transport strategy that will set the future direction for improved connectivity and accessibility across the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson welcomed the State Government’s new draft public transport strategy for the southern area of the Sunshine Coast and strongly encouraged all residents to have their say.

“Public transport connectivity is critical to the functionality and economic prosperity and liveability of our Sunshine Coast and south east Queensland, now and into the future, especially in providing for a viable alternative to private car travel,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I encourage everyone to provide feedback on the draft Southern Sunshine Coast Public Transport Strategy.

“Sunshine Coast Council’s Integrated Transport Strategy also provides a blueprint for an integrated, safe, efficient and sustainable transport system.

“When it comes to transport, each level of government, working in partnership for our community, is also critical.” 

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey today (16 February) released the draft Southern Sunshine Coast Public Transport Strategy that contains the vision for future public transport options in the region.

“The Sunshine Coast is Queensland’s third biggest city and as the region’s population continues to grow, so to does the need for an efficient and well connected public transport network,” Mr Bailey said.

“The draft South East Queensland Regional Transport Plan and ShapingSEQ strategy both outlined the specific needs of the Southern Sunshine Coast community, which this strategy directly responds to.

“What we now have is a blueprint for short, medium and long-term transport developments in the region – whether that be bus corridors, heavy rail or multi-modal connections.

“Public transport will be developed around key corridors and connections to complement the southern Sunshine Coast’s character as well as keep people moving to and through the area."

The majority of the Sunshine Coast’s 320,000 residents live between Maroochydore and Beerwah, and an additional 190,000 are expected to call the region home over the next 20 years.

“It has never been more important to get transport planning right,” Mr Bailey said.

He said the plan would simplify Sunshine Coast services by building up four key corridors:

Coastal: new mass transit service between Caloundra and Maroochydore providing a reliable and direct high-capacity public transport connection for shorter trips on the coast.

Centre: a link via the protected Caloundra and Maroochydore Corridor Options Study (CAMCOS) that provides for longer distance trips on the coast and to the rest of South East Queensland.

Western: upgraded infrastructure along the existing North Coast rail line.

Key connectors: new and upgraded east-west bus connections, more dedicated bus priority and high frequency routes and local services that spread the benefits of mass transit.

Mr Bailey said an important part in delivering the strategy successfully would be partnering with the Sunshine Coast Council.

“Ensuring that all levels of government are committed to a unified vision for public transport in the future is essential to delivering the best outcomes for locals,” he said.

“As part of our partnership, the Palaszczuk Government have commenced a $15 million, jointly funded detailed business case for the first stage of Sunshine Coast Mass Transit.

“Work is also underway to investigate a heavy rail connection from Beerwah to Maroochydore as part of the CAMCOS corridor and design is underway for the $320 million Mooloolah River Interchange upgrade.”
