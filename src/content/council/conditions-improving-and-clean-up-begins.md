The weather on the Sunshine Coast has improved, but the danger is not over, with roads extensively damaged, flood levels still high and landslides and falling trees a high risk.

Authorities are urging people to stay off the roads while crews urgently assess and prioritise works, ahead of undertaking repairs over the coming week.

They are also clearing debris and landslides across the region.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads has advised the Bruce Highway remains closed in both directions at Six Mile Creek and is likely to remain closed for the rest of today and overnight.

Sunshine Motorway is closed north of the Sunshine Coast Airport.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson thanked the community for staying home yesterday and has urged them to continue to stay safe and stay home as recovery efforts begin.

“The weather has improved, however we’re not out of the woods just yet,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Showers and wind are forecast for today and while river levels will continue to drop over the next 24 hours high tides will still impact neighbouring roads and property.

“Please keep safety your number one priority and stay away from flood waters.

“We’ve experienced minor flooding in some areas, with moderate to major flooding in other areas, including the Mooloolah River which reached 4.7 metres this morning and may peak at 4.8 metres as water continues to move down the system.

“Following today’s high tide, water levels should begin to drop and will hopefully return to normal levels over the next day or two.

“Please be patient over the coming days as our emergency services and council crews work through the significant recovery task.

“Many roads are still closed and we are repairing and opening roads as soon as possible. If you see any hazards, please report them to council.

“The hard work starts now in terms of recovery and will continue over the coming weeks.”

Motorists are urged to stay off the roads, unless for essential purposes.

Evacuation centres remain open for people in need at the Nambour Showgrounds and the University of the Sunshine Coast stadium.

All Sunshine Coast beaches will be closed today, due to dangerous weather and surf conditions.

Energex reported approximately 3000 homes without power in Caloundra, Nambour, Maleny, Kenilworth. Conditions are challenging and residents are asked to be patient while Energex crews undertake the slow and safe restoration.
