Upgrading the bridge and boardwalk in the Yaroomba Bushland Park, renewing the amenities block at Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park, and renewing shelters at Waalum Park at Mount Coolum are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 8.

Divisional councillor Jason O’Pray said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future across the region.

“I’m very pleased to see $370,000 has been allocated to replace and renew the bridge and boardwalk in Yaroomba Bushland Park, a hidden gem of an environmental reserve off Neurum Road,” Cr O’Pray said.

“This upgrade will ensure that accessibility throughout this surprising bushland oasis is maintained, whether people come to enjoy it with prams, wheelchairs, bicycles or with four-legged friends on leads.

“Another popular little community park, Waalum Park at Mount Coolum, will also greatly benefit from new shelters and picnic tables and seats.

“Council’s skilled Landscape Design staff have consulted with enthusiastic representatives from the Seaside Shores Community Association on this project, and it’ll be great to see some of the old timber repurposed in these new structures.

“Council will also invest more than $500,000 on important recreation park and landscape amenity updates across Division 8, benefiting all who come to enjoy our beautiful beaches, playgrounds, and picnic areas.”

“To support the increasing visitor numbers to our region, $800,000 will be invested in the Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park.

“Replacement of the existing amenities building of this much-loved holiday hideaway will bring this facility up to the standard of the rest of the park.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
