A total of 16 locations across the Sunshine Coast have undergone vital upgrades giving motorists and riders a smoother and safer journey.

Funding from the Australian Government Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program Phase two has helped Sunshine Coast Council deliver road, cycle and pedestrian pathway upgrades across our region.

Sunshine Coast Council Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said council had delivered much needed upgrades, expansions and maintenance to our roads, cycle and pedestrian pathways right across the Sunshine Coast, and importantly the work supported local jobs.

“A variety of priority roads and pathways have been completed from Maleny, Palmwoods and Mooloolah Valley, to Buderim and Mudjimba further north. 

“Road resurfacing works have also wrapped up in Landsborough on a gravel section of road along Railway Street, and resealing Old Gympie Road between Coonowrin and Sahara Roads will soon be completed.  

“The majority of the projects have been completed, with a couple of upgrades anticipated to be finished by mid-2022.

“The $3.5 million dollar gravel road upgrade for Zgrajewski Road at Yandina Creek started early January.

“The works will see two kilometres of gravel road sealed to make it safer and more pleasant for road users.

“For the safety of council’s workers and our community, the full length of Zgrajewski Road, between McCords Road and Arcoona Road, will be closed to through traffic and is expected to be open to motorists in early May.

“An alternative route will be available via Yandina-Coolum Road for through traffic and nearby residents outside the project site.

“The final stage of $2.4 million Citrus Road in Eudlo is nearing completion. The upgrade works began in August 2021.

“Road base, sealing, kerbing, drainage works, and landscaping will be completed ready to be opened to the community very soon.”  

Cr Baberowski said the coastal pathway between Bokarina and Warana was expected to be completed in early-2022, weather permitting.

“By improving pathways which run adjacent to our beaches, parks and leisure areas our community can get outdoors and explore the coast.”

The Australian Government’s Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across Australia, supporting jobs and the resilience of local economies to help communities bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sunshine Coast Council has received $11 million in funding for these vital road upgrades. This funding is part of $22 million committed to the Sunshine Coast region for priority projects through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program.

Federal Member for Fisher Andrew Wallace said that these Commonwealth funded projects have come at a critical time as we build the Sunshine Coast’s recovery from COVID-19.

“Cycling around the region on my Tour de Fisher I have seen how rough and dangerous some of these roads, especially in the Hinterland can be,” Mr Wallace said. 

“Not only are these Federally funded infrastructure projects improving road safety and getting locals home sooner, they are also supporting vital jobs, construction businesses and economic growth across the Sunshine Coast at a time when we need it the most.

“I am committed to ensuring that the Federal Government continues to deliver the unprecedented investment we have seen in our region’s Infrastructure since 2016 so that we can continue to create the Sunshine Coast we all want to see in the years to come.”

Member for Fairfax, Ted O’Brien said that the massive $11 million Federal funding boost has already had an enormous impact on the lives of Sunshine Coast locals.

“It’s great to see Commonwealth funded road projects having such a positive impact on the lives of local people,” Mr O’Brien said.

“This includes Yandina Creek resident Angelo Reitano who, after a three-decade wait, can finally have the road in front of his house sealed with the support of $3.2 million in Federal funding.

“This $11 million funding boost is another example of the Federal Government helping the Sunshine Coast recover from the COVID-19 Pandemic by supporting shovel ready projects and local jobs.”
