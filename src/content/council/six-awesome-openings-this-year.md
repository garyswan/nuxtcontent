It’s no wonder so many people are choosing to call the Sunshine Coast home.

We have the most incredible natural landscape spanning beach and bush, and we have an endless stream of awesome new and revitalised community spaces popping up in every neighbourhood.

Let’s look at six of the Sunshine Coast Council’s best new openings:

**Hinterland Splash Park**

A vibrant new water park opened in the Sunshine Coast hinterland this year, attracting more than 4,000 visitors on the first weekend! The $3.2 million dollar [Nambour Aquatic Centre Splash Park](https://oursc.com.au/community/new-3-2-million-dollar-water-park-redefines-family-fun-in-the-hinterland)
&#x20;now features more than 580 square metres of exciting waterplay for people of all ages and abilities. Locals have been lapping up the new waterpark, taking full advantage of the zero-depth and fully accessible splash pad, toddler slides, water jet features, tipping buckets, and two giant adventure water slides. Summer school holidays, here we come!

**Waterfront Wonderland**

Just when you thought Mooloolaba had it all, along comes the brand-new [Northern Parkland.](https://oursc.com.au/community/sunshine-coasts-newest-16-million-beachfront-parkland-now-open)
&#x20;The prime beachfront space is luring visitors from across the region and beyond to soak up some relaxation and recreation. Highlights include a ‘southern-hemisphere first’ children’s playground, beachfront barbecues, expansive coastal pathways and grassed areas, and a stunning elevated boardwalk with viewing platforms. And it’s not just Sunshine Coast residents singing the parklands’ praises! The revitalised community space has been crowned [Project of the Year](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Waterfront-wonderland-celebrated-as-a-shining-example)
&#x20;by the Institute of Public Works Engineering Australasia, and also received the [Green Space Urban Award](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Green-thumbs-up-for-Mooloolabas-Northern-Parkland)
 by the Australian Institute of Horticulture for environmental responsibility and ‘greening’ the built landscape.

Don’t forget, you can park all day for only $5 at the Mooloolaba Central Park N Go, accessible via Brisbane Road and Smith Street.

**Coast’s newest off-leash dog park**

We love our furry friends here on the Sunshine Coast, so it’s no surprise that locals and their loyal pals are barking mad for Mapleton’s new off-leash [dog park](https://oursc.com.au/featured/unleashed-coasts-newest-dog-park-off-and-running)
. The new doggy area at Lilly Pond’s Park opened in October, offering a dedicated space to safely enjoy our active and healthy lifestyle, while still being close to town and community. ‘Walkies’ anyone?

**Lush new loos for Coast’s Holidays Parks**

Yes, you heard right! Lush new loos opened at the Coolum and Mudjima [Holiday Parks](https://oursc.com.au/featured/how-you-can-holiday-in-comfort-at-beachside-havens)
&#x20;this year - and they’re worthy of celebration. The new $3 million facilities offer campers and nomads all the creature comforts of home, and are also fully accessible and environmentally considerate too! Solar power generation, battery storage, and rainwater harvesting are among some of the many new highlights to ensure both people and planet are suitably relieved.

**Coastal Pathways and Beautiful Boardwalks**

Summer strolls just got better! This year we saw the opening of the new three-metre-wide [coastal pathway](https://oursc.com.au/featured/check-out-this-pathway-to-your-next-adventure)
&#x20;at Dicky Beach and Kawana. These important links invite locals to get active and meander through nature with more than 73 kilometres of coastal pathways between Bells Creek and Coolum. Beautiful new boardwalks, such as those at [Buderim](https://oursc.com.au/community/new-buderim-boardwalk-connecting-community-and-nature)
&#x20;and [Yaroomba](https://oursc.com.au/featured/where-you-can-explore-new-eco-boardwalk)
, have also been unveiled to improve connectivity and recreation in our neighbourhoods.

**Sunshine Coast City Hall**

The new Maroochydore City Hall is now open, and we couldn’t be more excited! It’s the centrepiece for our region’s growing CBD, signaling a new era for business and innovation on the Sunshine Coast. Featuring 10 floors of contemporary community, retail, and workspace with areas available for community groups and businesses to hire. There’s also communal space, end-of-trip facilities, and green zones. [Check it out](https://oursc.com.au/community/community-celebrates-sunshine-coast-city-halls-official-opening)
