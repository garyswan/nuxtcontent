Did you know Kenilworth Dairies are now bottling their own milk?

The company realised this lifetime goal in late 2020 and you can find their product on the shelves of your local IGA and independents all over the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council is proud to have supported the team throughout their journey as they've grown including having them join our first ‘Flavours of the Sunshine Coast’ regional showcase at Brisbane’s South Bank and again at our ‘Flavours of the Sunshine Coast’ regional showcase at Fine Food in Sydney in 2017.

The Kenilworth Dairies team has been involved in many of Council's business support programs over the years and we are so happy it has helped them achieve such success.

Kenilworth Dairies is one of our Sunshine Coast #BusinessChampions who have been innovating and adapting to the changes under COVID-19.
