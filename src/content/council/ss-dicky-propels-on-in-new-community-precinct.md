A piece of maritime history has found a new home ashore at Sunshine Coast Council's newly developed Dicky Beach Precinct.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council had invested $1.6 million in the precinct upgrades and the project was proving popular.

“We developed a plan for the area working hand in hand with our community following the partial removal of the historic SS Dicky wreck from the beach in 2015,” Mayor Jamieson said.

The SS Dicky was an iron-hulled steamer, driven ashore at Caloundra during a cyclone in 1893.

A number of efforts were made to re-float the Dicky but on each occasion it beached and was eventually abandoned.

“Our community told us the area’s skate culture was important to them, as was the story of the SS Dicky and we have installed the propeller from the ship as a feature in the precinct," Mayor Jamieson said.

“A new plaque will be installed in the coming months to continue to tell the story of the SS Dicky."

Dedicated and humble members of Caloundra Tidy Towns committee, Colin White and Graham Smith have been long time advocates for the SS Dicky preservation.

The duo were pleased to see the propeller on display at the new precinct for all to enjoy for years to come and were looking forward to the future staged works.
