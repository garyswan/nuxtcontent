A new signalised intersection, upgraded pedestrian crossings and a new shared pedestrian and cyclist pathway to improve safety and traffic flow have been completed.

The upgraded Caloundra intersection at Queen and Bower Streets now features traffic signals and two raised priority crossings for pedestrians and cyclists, to help improve community safety, particularly for local school students.   

A new three-metre-wide shared pathway running adjacent to the Queen Street service lane has also been completed.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the changes would improve community safety and help relieve traffic congestion at peak periods.

“Traffic movements during the school drop-off and pick-up times will now be safer and easier thanks to new dedicated turning lanes and traffic signals,” Cr Landsberg said.

“It’s been great to see so many children walking or riding to school along the new shared pathway from Bower Street to Ulm Street, running along the Queen Street service lane.

“This upgrade has given parents and carers peace of mind knowing their nearest and dearest are getting to and from school safely.

“I would like to thank our local community for their patience and co-operation throughout construction, with a special mention to residents, Caloundra State High School, the Caloundra Uniting Church and the Caloundra Community Centre.

“This intersection upgrade is one of many transport projects for the Caloundra area that are planned or currently being designed by Sunshine Coast Council, including the Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade, which will reduce congestion and improve access for walking, cycling, public transport, freight and private vehicles.”

The Bower Street to Ulm Street shared pathway is proudly supported by the Queensland Government's Cycle Network Local Government Grants program. 

State Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the project had made a big improvement to the area.

“Like everyone else who uses Queen Street as part of the morning commute, I would like to congratulate the Sunshine Coast Council for the work on this upgrade,” Mr Hunt said.

“I was delighted to see that Council has not only improved congestion on the road but also added signals and crossing points to greatly enhance the safety of school students using the crossing at peak periods.”

Construction started mid-August 2022 with all works completed earlier this month (May 2023)

### Key features of the intersection upgrade:

*   installing traffic signals for new signalised pedestrian crossings
*   line marking to formalise traffic lanes on Queen and Bower streets
*   an additional west bound traffic lane
*   providing a right turn traffic lane from Queen Street to Bower Street
*   resurfacing Queen Street, between Bower Street and Allen Street
*   a new three-metre-wide shared pathway including two raised priority crossings for pedestrians and cyclists between Bower and Ulm streets (running adjacent to the Queen Street service lane)
*   street lighting, landscaping and drainage improvements.
