Tis’ the season of the Little Reds!

Arriving fashionably, yet predictively late to the end-of-year festivities you may have noticed the Little Red Flying-fox have joined us in late November-early December as they do most years.

This species of flying-fox, unlike the black and grey-headed flying-fox species LOVE to party, and generally only visit the Sunshine Coast from this time until around April to celebrate Christmas, New Years AND Easter!

Oh, and they may be here to mate and feed on the Pink Bloodwoods that flower at this time of year too.

Tyron explains why little red flying foxes visit the Sunshine Coast each Christmas.

So, you might want to crank up the Christmas carols…

These little guys may be the smallest flying-fox species in Australia, but they are also mighty loud. Unlike their grey and black cousins, Little Red Flying-foxes are the noisiest, and travel in larger numbers (sometimes in the tens of thousands or more).

We understand this may be overwhelming, but thankfully we get some reprieve with the Little Reds disappearing just as quickly as they arrived to fly back to western and central Queensland to give birth and rear their young.

Tyron explains how long you can expect little red flying foxes to stay on the Sunshine Coast

Make sure you stay in the loop and keep an eye out for our upcoming [Flying-fox Community News](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Education-Resources-and-Events/Environment-Resources-and-Publications/Native-Animals/Flying-Foxes)
