Investing more than $2 million in the new Forest Park West at Sippy Downs, $1 million for the feasibility and concept design of a new library and community venue also at Sippy Downs plus significant upgrades to cycling and pedestrian facilities are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 6. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said there was so much to look forward to in this year’s budget for residents in Division 6. “Council will invest $2 million to design and construct a district recreation park at Forest Park West – Sippy Downs’ first district-level park,” Cr Dickson said.\
“Works include an amenities building, shelters, barbecues, three play areas, park furniture, pathways and boardwalks, park lighting, garden beds and an open space lawn area.\
“It will provide fantastic recreational opportunities for locals and visitors to the area.\
“The $1 million allocated in this year’s budget for the feasibility and concept design for the new library and community centre on Central Drive in Sippy Downs is another outstanding project which will provide enormous benefits to our local community.

“A significant investment will be made in transport infrastructure within Division 6, including $650,000 to design the $2.9 million Karawatha Drive cycle lanes project between Golf Links Road to Prelude Drive at Mountain Creek and planning for an upgrade to the intersection of Sippy Downs Drive, Claymore Road and Dixon Road which will see an additional right-turn lane installed.\
“A new pedestrian refuge will be installed from Mountain Close through the centre median island onto the north side of Karawatha Drive in Mountain Creek. This will include pedestrian lighting.\
“A 440m stretch of pedestrian pathway between Nyes Crescent and 73 Dixon Road in Buderim will be renewed, while a new public amenities block will be constructed in the popular Glenfields Neighbourhood Park in Mountain Creek.”\
Cr Dickson said a large number of parks and gardens projects within Division 6 were included in this year’s budget.\
“In addition to the exciting Forest Park West project, council will also deliver upgrades to fitness equipment in Edgewater Lakes Park, Albany Lakes Park, Sippy Downs, while playground improvements will also be carried out in Loang Court Park, Dardgee Park and Piccabeen Crescent Park, Mountain Creek,” Cr Dickson said.\
“More than a dozen other parks in Division 6 will also undergo various refurbishments, including shelter and furniture upgrades, barbecue renewals and installation of new name signs.\
“Dog owners will also be pleased to see a $15,000 investment in improvements to the Buderim Dog Park on Syd Lingard Drive, including a shelter upgrade, fence renewals and erosion control works.\
“I’m also pleased to see $250,000 in the budget to renew the Duck Bill-Head Wall in Mountain Creek and a $20,000 allocation to replace the 30m retaining wall in Serena Close, Buderim.\
“These projects are on the back of other exciting initiatives which benefit our local communities and will be completed in the new financial year, including $50,000 for the Buddina Soccer Club at Mountain Creek and $65,000 for the Glenfield’s Welcome Tree Lighting project at Mountain Creek.”\
