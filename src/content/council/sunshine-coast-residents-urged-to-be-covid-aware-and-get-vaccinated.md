Sunshine Coast residents are strongly encouraged to register their interest in getting vaccinated and come forward for testing if they have any COVID-19 symptoms (no matter how minor), as south east Queensland enters a three-day lockdown from 6pm today (29 June 2021).

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor and Local Disaster Management Group chair Mark Jamieson said it was vital to detect if there were positive cases in the community as quickly as possible and minimise the risk of exposure by only leaving home for essential purposes as outlined by the Chief Health Officer.

You can only leave your residence (which includes temporary accommodation such as a holiday rental) for limited permitted purposes such as:

*   obtaining essential goods or services, including healthcare (including vaccinations)
*   exercise
*   attending essential work or childcare
*   assisting vulnerable persons.

Residents are encouraged to stay in their local area wherever possible.

&#x20;for full details on restrictions in Queensland.

Mayor Jamieson reminded people that they needed to get two doses of the vaccine to be fully vaccinated.

“Remember to book your second dose appointment before leaving your first dose appointment and if you are due to receive your second dose, please make sure you follow up and do so,” Mayor Jamieson said.

He urged residents and visitors to comply with Queensland Health directions including handwashing, social distancing, checking in to any venues that you visit with the Queensland Government QR code and get tested if you have any symptoms.

“Given the particularly virulent strain of the COVID-19 virus that has recently been detected in some community transmission cases in south east Queensland, it is vital everyone complies with the Chief Health Officer’s directions.

“There is no room for complacency with any of this and I am asking everyone to again do their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19.”

He urged Sunshine Coast residents and visitors to check Queensland Health’s website for updates and stay COVID alert.

“We also want everyone to follow all of the steps that we have all become familiar with now in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“Options for [testing](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/stay-informed/testing-and-fever-clinics)
&#x20;are listed on Queensland Health’s website and include a drive-through testing clinic at Caloundra Aerodrome, 14 Pathfinder Drive, Caloundra West from 7am to 3pm weekdays. A GP referral is **not** needed.”
