The site of a world-class new indoor centre that will be enjoyed by the Sunshine Coast community before, during and long after the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, has been revealed.

As planning steps up for the Games, Kawana has been chosen for an exciting sporting expansion that will boost a range of clubs and also benefit business, tourism and allied health providers.

Sunshine Coast Council, in conjunction with Brisbane 2032 Games Delivery Partners, will deliver a new international indoor sports centre that will have capacity for 11 courts and the ability to convert to a 6000-seat show court.

It is expected to be up and running in 2027 and funded by the Australian and Queensland Governments under their Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games funding agreement with the cost to be determined once the design process is completed.

Deputy Premier Steven Miles and Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson on Wednesday (February 1) jointly announced the new centre plus an expansion of the outdoor Sunshine Coast Stadium, aquatic centre and Sunshine Coast Sports Hub.

Mayor Jamieson said the expanded sports hub would benefit the entire community and visitors to the region for many decades.

“Confirmation of the new Indoor Stadium at Kawana now provides the opportunity to develop our very own world-class sporting precinct here on the Sunshine Coast.

“Without a doubt, the Sunshine Coast will once again be the envy of other regional areas across the country.

“In other exciting news, the long-awaited Sunshine Coast Stadium expansion should now start in 2024.’’

The expansion will deliver an additional 10,768 fixed seats, taking total fixed seating capacity to 11,814. By utilising the mounds at the northern and southern ends, the stadium will have a total capacity of approximately 16,000. Additional temporary seating can be installed to boost the total seating capacity to 20,000 to accommodate the proposed 2032 Olympic Games football matches.

Mayor Jamieson said the development of the Indoor Sports Centre at Kawana would benefit a range of groups and sports, including basketball, netball, volleyball, pickleball, futsal and badminton.

Mayor Mark Jamieson and Deputy Premier Steven Miles celebrate the new indoor stadium announcement at Kawana.

“Importantly, it will provide an opportunity to design and construct a facility that will be leading edge in respect to accessibility and service to the many para-sports and athletes we have in the region,’’ Mayor Jamieson said.

“As part of the Future Host Questionnaire that was submitted to the International Olympic Committee Future Host Commission in May 2021, the Kawana Sports Precinct was presented as the preferred location to co-host the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games basketball competition.

“The Kawana location has now been confirmed with the Brisbane 2032 OCOG and the Queensland Government and planning and design works will start immediately with a view of commencing construction of the new indoor sports centre in 2025.

“This will result in the venue being available to our community in 2027, well before the proposed Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games basketball competition – which is exactly what our collective commitment to a 10+10+ legacy is all about.’’

Queensland Deputy Premier and Minister Assisting the Premier on Olympic and Paralympic Games Infrastructure, Steven Miles, said the sports precinct at Kawana was well positioned to provide lasting benefits for the region.

“We knew bringing the Olympic and Paralympic Games to Queensland would deliver many benefits right across the state,” the Deputy Premier said.

“The Sunshine Coast Indoor Sports Centre will be one of six new sporting venues this government is investing in, and all of these venues will be ready for use well before the Games comes to Queensland.

“Located at Kawana as part of the Sunshine Coast Sport Precinct, the new indoor sports centre will inspire the next generation of Sunshine Coast athletes, support growth, and play host to one of the most significant sporting events in the world.

“All Brisbane 2032 venues are planned with lasting benefits in mind to meet the demands of our growing Queensland population.

“It cements the Sunshine Coast’s importance during the Games and delivers legacy benefits for decades to come.”

Brisbane 2032 OCOG President Andrew Liveris said that OCOG was supportive that Kawana had been confirmed as the location for the 2032 Games venue. 

“There has been significant input from subject matter experts confirming Kawana as the location for the Indoor Sports Centre, which aligns with the Brisbane 2032 candidature and Master Plan,” Mr Liveris said.

“The information demonstrates that the Sunshine Coast Sports Precinct at Kawana will deliver great outcomes for both community sport and the Games.

“Come July 2032, South-East Queensland will be on show to the world and the Sunshine Coast Sport Precinct at Kawana will be a perfect example of embracing the International Olympic Committee’s New Norm – an event and accompanying venues that are suited to the community’s long-term needs, affordable, beneficial and sustainable.”

The decision to develop the Indoor Sports Centre at Kawana follows a review of the site and another located in the Maroochydore City Centre. That proposal was for basketball to be hosted in the proposed (but not yet funded) Sunshine Coast Exhibition and Convention Centre, within the Maroochydore City Centre.
