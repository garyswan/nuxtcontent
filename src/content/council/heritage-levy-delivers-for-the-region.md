A digital First Nations experience, funding assistance for heritage-listed buildings, and projects supporting our region’s museums and heritage sector top the list of significant achievements in Sunshine Coast Council’s Heritage Levy annual report.

The report was endorsed at council’s ordinary meeting today (10 November).

The [Heritage Levy](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About/Heritage-Levy)
&#x20;is a $13 annual payment, contributed by all properties in the region,  this year raises $1.9million to document, research, conserve, protect, promote and provide access to those tangible and intangible items, places, facilities and events that define the stories, history and values of the people, communities and culture of the Sunshine Coast.

[The Sunshine Coast Heritage Levy Annual Report, 2020/21](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About/Heritage-Levy/Annual-Report)
&#x20;outlines the levy program delivered under the five outcome areas of Knowledge, Conservation, Support, Communication, and Advocacy. Developed annually, the levy program is aligned to the 10-year Sunshine Coast Heritage Plan and is endorsed by council at its annual Budget meeting.

Sunshine Coast Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the Heritage Levy played a key role in bringing the [Sunshine Coast Heritage Plan 2021 – 2031](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About/Heritage-Levy/Heritage-Planning)
, endorsed in February 2021, to life.

“The endorsement and subsequent delivery of the Heritage Plan was a key achievement this year, providing council with a strategic roadmap to ensure council effectively manages and conserves the region’s heritage assets,” Cr Baberowski said.

“One of the plan’s deliverable was to develop a regional [Heritage Discovery Guide](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Places/Heritage-Discover-Guide)
. This simple brochure has invigorated awareness of, and visitation to, our places of heritage interest and has been well received by both visitors and residents.

“Another key highlight was the delivery of a [First Nations Virtual Reality](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Bankfoot-House/First-Nations-at-Bankfoot-House)
&#x20;program, a collaborative project which takes participants back to one day before European Settlement at the Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct.

“The virtual reality platform provides an engaging platform for people to get a real appreciation and understanding of First Nations culture in an engaging and contemporary way.

“Finding new ways to impart our heritage, knowledge and culture is something council is committed to and much work has been done to digitise our region’s [collections](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Collections)
, archival material and [stories](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Stories)
&#x20;.

“This enables us to share knowledge more broadly across multiple digital platforms, safeguard these assets from the physical elements and showcase our region’s fascinating history.”
