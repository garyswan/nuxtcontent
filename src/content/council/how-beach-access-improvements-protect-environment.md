Access to a popular Sunshine Coast beach has received some love and care to help beachgoers stay on the right track and protect a sensitive environment.

The old sets of timber stairs at beach access (BA) 247 Wurley Drive and 251 Petrel Court, Wurtulla, have been completely replaced while BA249 at Poatina Street and BA250 near Bellbird Circuit have received a refresh.

Sunshine Coast Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said designated beach accesses helped to protect the dunes and coastal foreshore areas from erosion and damage.

“Staying on the right track to access the beach protects our dunes and wildlife,” Cr Cox said.

“Council carries out regular repairs, maintenance or upgrades to keep each access in good condition.

“This also means our local community can continue to get safely to the beach.”

Cr Cox said incorporating timber into the design helped to keep the finished result in line with the organic and natural feel of our foreshore areas.

“This mix of materials also delivers the best value for ratepayer money by providing a robust and long lasting set of stairs,” Cr Cox said.

“Now this work is complete, it means all timber stair accesses in the Wurtulla stretch between BA247 and BA252 have been rebuilt or had significant maintenance in the past few years.”
