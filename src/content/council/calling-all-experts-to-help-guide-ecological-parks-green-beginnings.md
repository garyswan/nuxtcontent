People with innovative, creative and visionary ideas and expertise are being called upon to help guide the transformation of a stunning 65 hectare property near Maleny, into the Sunshine Coast Ecological Park.

Purchased by Sunshine Coast Council, which foresaw how the property would complement the neighbouring Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve, the proposed ecological park is one step closer to a becoming a reality.

The project is now moving into an exciting new phase which includes forming an Expert Advisory Panel (EAP).

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said expressions of interest for the EAP were now open.

“To ensure this project delivers on our vision to create a place of cherished nature and ecological wonder for generations to discover and enjoy, we are creating a panel of experts from relevant fields to provide innovative ideas, creativity and visionary direction,” Cr Cox said.

“Council will plan and create an ecological park like no other so it’s important we establish a core group of people to provide expert advice to ensure this green space continues to evolve.

“Membership will be open to representatives from specific areas of interest including conservation, park management, nature-based recreation, visual arts, landscape architecture, urban design, civil engineering and tourism.

“Their independent advice to council will assist in developing a Master Plan and Strategic Business Case to deliver the ecological park and guide council’s decision-making process.”

The proposed ecological park is located within Mountain View, one of the Sunshine Coast’s five major green spaces which includes the Regional Inter-urban Break, Blue Heart Sunshine Coast, Lower Mooloolah River and the Coast.

Division 5 councillor Winston Johnston said the proposed ecological park would help build on the green spaces initiative which contributed to the region’s identity and liveability.

“Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve is well-loved by locals and visitors and we consider the purchase of neighbouring properties to be a sound investment to achieve our vision: Australia’s most sustainable region,” Cr Johnston said.

“This council continues to prioritise green spaces across our region to accommodate our current residents and those who will choose to call Sunshine Coast home in the future. As the region grows in population, so should our green spaces.

“Everyone living at or visiting Maleny appreciates its beauty and the proposed Sunshine Coast Ecological Park will add to its already impressive natural areas.”
