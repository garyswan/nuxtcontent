The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round, now all the way to The Ginger Factory.

Sunshine Coast residents and visitors have long been waiting for an extension of the Translink bus route 631 (Noosa to Nambour via Cooroy and Eumundi) that would take them to The Ginger Factory, Yandina.

Councils’ contribution was funded by the Sunshine Coast Transport Levy.

Sunshine Coast Council Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said that moving around our region efficiently and sustainably as our population continued to grow was critical to maintaining liveability and productivity.

“I’m genuinely pleased that the State Government has announced significant improvements to nine of their bus services on the Sunshine Coast, including the extension to route 631 to The Ginger Factory,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Overall, each of these service improvements, which add, extend, and increase the frequency of the bus services helps tip the balance for more users to consider using public transport rather than their car.”

Division 10 Councillor David Law said Council had worked tirelessly with Translink to make this happen, and the hard work had paid off.

“I’m especially pleased with the bus service extension to The Ginger Factory,” Cr Law said.

“The Ginger Factory has always been a favourite destination for families and with its fun rides, fascinating tours, and café surrounded by beautiful sub-tropical gardens, it is now easily accessible by public transport.”
