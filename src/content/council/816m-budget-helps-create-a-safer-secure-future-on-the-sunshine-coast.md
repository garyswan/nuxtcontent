Creating a safer, secure future for our community remains sharply in focus with Sunshine Coast Council endorsing its $816 million budget for 2021/22.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the budget would continue to support the region’s recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 by investing $268 million in job-creating local infrastructure projects, supporting pensioners through increased concessions and increasing spending on frontline services for our community.

“We have delivered a considered budget focused on local recovery with no increase to the minimum general rate, which is good news for a majority of ratepayers,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“COVID-19 has resulted in the most severe global economic crisis in more than a century and we are not out of the woods yet.

“You only have to see the recent interstate lock downs and our own experience earlier this month to understand how vulnerable communities can be during the recovery process.

“Thanks to our council’s track record of disciplined financial management, we entered the pandemic last year in a strong budget position with a $5 million Disaster Rehabilitation Reserve.

“That reserve provided us with the ability to respond when we needed to, and we gave every ratepayer a one-off $35 COVID rebate last year.

“This year, council is again looking to the future as we balance our investment in our environment, our community and our economy and continue to support our region’s recovery efforts.

“In line with our role as guardians for the well-being of our community, we will re-establish the $5 million Disaster Rehabilitation Reserve which will be set aside to aid our recovery from a future major disaster.

“Our council is also responding to what matters most to our community by increasing our investment in on-the-ground services, such as parks and gardens maintenance, community facilities, sporting precincts and providing health and wellbeing programs – all of which will help more people, more often.

“The re-establishment of the $5 million Disaster Rehabilitation Reserve and the increase in on-the-ground services will be funded by removing the 5% discount for on-time rates payment.

“This is a financially prudent approach to support our growing community, while avoiding an across-the-board increase in the general rate.

“Council remains committed however, to assisting ratepayers who cannot pay in full by the due date and will be continuing to offer payment arrangements.

“Anyone experiencing financial hardship only needs to contact council before their rates are due, to arrange payment by instalments over a six-month period, without interest being charged.”

Mayor Jamieson said council also recognised the financial difficulties being experienced by pensioners in our community.

“All pensioners will benefit from a 14% increase in their pensioner rate concession,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Sole homeowners on full pensions will receive a $262 concession, an increased benefit of $32.

“Those receiving a part pension will also benefit, ranging from $9-$25, taking their concession to between $74 and $205, depending on whether they own the property solely or jointly.”

Mayor Jamieson said council would continue its commitment to driving a substantial capital works program, investing $268 million across the region, which would help support a stronger local economy, generate employment and provide access to new services and facilities for our community.  

He also reaffirmed council’s commitment to preferencing local businesses through its procurement arrangements wherever possible, after having spent $241 million with local suppliers in the current financial year to June 1.

“While our budget is focused on helping our community and local business recover from the impacts of COVID-19, we haven’t overlooked our enduring commitment to protecting our environment and natural assets,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The Environment Levy will increase by $4 to $80 and raise $11.9 million to continue to support our environmental partnerships and grants, education and other incentives, purchasing and managing land for conservation purposes, catchment and coastal rehabilitation projects.

“Importantly, this year’s $4 levy increase will raise $600,000 which will be allocated to enhancing the region’s response to weeds.

“This will entail targeted weed management demonstration programs, building community, industry and other agency partnerships and a focus on exploring and trialling new technology to improve identifying and managing weeds. 

“The Heritage Levy will remain at $13 and raise $1.9 million to continue to support a wide range of initiatives to promote our region’s heritage stories and assets.

“This will also support community museums, historical societies and cultural heritage projects developed in collaboration with Kabi Kabi, Jinibara and descendants of Australian South Sea Islander peoples.”

The Transport Levy will remain at $44, allowing $6.5 million to be directed towards numerous projects including finalising the options analysis for the Sunshine Coast Mass Transit project; implementing the five year travel change behaviour program; improving safe walk-up and cycle opportunities to selected bus stops; supporting and monitoring the new trial Ridescore Active Schools Program at selected schools; supporting the Council Link service for eligible persons travelling to their nearest centre; continued Flexilink services; and the Kenilworth Community Transport Service.

To account for increased contractor expenses, the cost to collect a standard 240 litre domestic wheelie bin will increase by $7.70 from $309.10 to $316.80.
