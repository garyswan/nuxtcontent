Whether you’re a green thumb or a little rough around the hedges, the Queensland Garden Expo at the Nambour Showgrounds has everything to help you branch out.

The Sunshine Coast Council-sponsored event will feature lectures and demos, display gardens, more than 360 exhibits, a giant kitchen garden feature and a gardeners’ cooking stage.

The event, from Friday to Sunday (July 7-9), showcases the largest speaker program of any gardening event in the country, with more than 120 presentations from 40 speakers.

Event manager Marion Beazley said she anticipated close to 40,000 people would attend, with keen gardeners expected to travel from as far as New Zealand for some gardening inspiration.

“For more than three decades the expo has grown into the gardening event with the largest and most comprehensive program of expert speakers in Australia,” Ms Beazley said.

“This year’s program will include more than 120 presentations and demonstrations across the three days, including talks about food foresting, cooking in the different seasons and tips on growing the perfect tomato.

“On Saturday and Sunday we also welcome \_Gardening Australia’s\_ Costa Georgiadis. Costa will bring his own special brand of enthusiasm as he shares his love of community, collaboration and the power of plants!

Ms Beazley said some of the other popular feature areas included Sunshine Coast Council’s “Living Backyard”.

“The Living Backyard appeals to those who are passionate about preserving and enhancing native flora and fauna,” she said.

“Whether it’s birds, frogs, butterflies, bees or other wildlife you’re hoping to attract to your garden, this is the best place to learn how to create a bio-diverse environment in your backyard.”

Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the highly popular Council-sponsored event continued to bloom and deliver significant benefits for the region.

“For more than 30 years this outstanding community-driven event has generated immense benefits for its supporters, partners, local businesses and the Sunshine Coast region whilst inspiring interest in gardening and leisure activities,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The 2022 Queensland Garden Expo was one of the largest ever and was estimated to have attracted 30,000 visitors and generated an economic benefit of $9 million for the Sunshine Coast region.”

The Queensland Garden Expo is one of many major and regional events being staged on the Sunshine Coast this year.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said getting to and from this year’s show would be easy, with convenient public transport and parking options available.

“Parking is available within the Nambour Showgrounds for $8 per car per day from 8am each day of the Expo. All proceeds from parking fees are donated to local service and community groups,” Cr Law said.

“Parking is also available for $5 per day at the Nambour Bowls Club as well as in the multi-storey car park in Mill Street.

“There will also be a free shuttle bus from approximately 8am daily from the Nambour Train Station. This service will drop you off at the main Nambour Showgrounds entrance gate and will depart from this same point for your return journey.”

Gates open at 8am each day. For more information and to purchase tickets online, visit [www.qldgardenexpo.com.au](http://www.qldgardenexpo.com.au/)
