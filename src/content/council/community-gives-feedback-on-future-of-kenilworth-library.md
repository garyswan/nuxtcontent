Sunshine Coast Council invited people who live, work, learn or play in the Kenilworth district to join the conversation about their library service.

The conversation will help inform and determine the type of library service which is best suited to the needs of the local community.

The smallest library within the Sunshine Coast Library Network, and the second oldest, the library has serviced the community in the same way for close to 40 years.

The Sunshine Coast Libraries Network Plan 2019-2041 provides a vision for the future library network and a blueprint for investments.

Manager, Arts Heritage and Libraries Claudia Di Blasi said part of the network plan included reviewing each library service and ensuring it was still fostering a positive influence on the community it serviced by responding to its needs.

“COVID has resulted in a significant shift in customer behaviour at all our libraries,” Ms Di Blasi said.

“The most significant has been at Kenilworth Library where we have seen an 86.7% drop in average monthly visitations since 2018/19.”

“The library is a council-owned building, and we would like to understand why the service is so underutilised and how it can be reshaped to best meet the needs of the current Kenilworth community.”

Division 10 Councillor David Law thanked the community for its ongoing contributions and feedback throughout the community engagement process.

“The community has been on a journey and engaging with the local Kenilworth community is a step in the right direction to ensure the library service appropriately responds to the needs of the community,” Cr Law said.

“We received 165 survey responses from the community and a range of active contributions during focus group discussions, which also looked to develop partnership opportunities with local organisations.

“The conversation continued in the media and social media platforms clearly articulating that the library is loved.

“Contemporary library services take many forms and through community conversations, and the evaluation of the feedback from the community which is now underway, we hope to see a service that responds to those needs today.

“Any recommendation to change the service will be part of an ongoing conversation with the community and our library members.

“I encourage the local community to follow the project updates via Council’s Have Your Say page.”
