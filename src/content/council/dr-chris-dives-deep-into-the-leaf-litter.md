BOOK NOW for a workshop, talk or walk to discover the rainforest’s Tiny Giants for yourself – October 21–24.

Meet Dr Chris Burwell from Queensland Museum. This October he’ll be one of the twelve scientists helping to fill in the knowledge gaps about the insects, spiders and other invertebrates that call Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve home, as part of Tiny Giants.

**What research will you be doing?**

I’ll be searching for and collecting ants from lots of different habitats; in leaf litter, on the ground, under rocks, inside rotten logs and on tree trunks and leaves.

In my spare time I’ll also be collecting and photographing dragonflies and damselflies.

**Why is your research important?**

Ants are a very useful group of insects for environmental monitoring because they are abundant, there are lots of species, and they are sensitive to climatic changes and habitat disturbance.

**What will you do with the research after the event?**

I’ll be comparing the ant species of Mary Cairncross Reserve with those of other rainforests in areas of south-eastern Queensland. The ant fauna progressively changes from the lowland to highland rainforest; as you move up in elevation some ant species drop out and different ones appear. This makes ants a very useful group to track the impacts of climate change.
