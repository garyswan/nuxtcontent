From a comprehensive selection process, Sunshine Coast Council has appointed highly credentialed and experienced leader Debra Robinson to the position of Group Executive, Customer Engagement and Planning Services (CEPS).

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas said Ms Robinson was a long-term resident of the Sunshine Coast and most recently held the position of Director, Major Projects and Strategic Property at Sunshine Coast Council.

“Debra brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this role, having worked at a number of councils as well as private planning consultancies and development companies in Queensland including the Sunshine Coast, and Victoria,” Mrs Thomas said.

“Debra has formal town planning qualifications, holds a Master of Business Administration, is a Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and in 2006 she was awarded the Outstanding Businesswoman of the Year by the Sunshine Coast Business Women’s Network.

“Before joining Sunshine Coast Council in 2017, Debra held the role of Manager, Development Services with Brisbane City Council. In this role Debra was responsible for a multi-disciplinary team of approximately 350 staff and was responsible for facilitating the timely and effective processing of development approvals.

“I am delighted to welcome Debra into this new role and excited about her continuing participation on Council’s Executive Leadership Team.”

Ms Robinson said having opportunities to work with industry and community leaders on a range of critical projects was an exciting element to her new role within Council.    

“I am extremely passionate about the Sunshine Coast and while my new role as Group Executive Customer Engagement and Planning is a very exciting opportunity, it is also a significant responsibility and a challenge that I am greatly looking forward to,” Ms Robinson said. 

“One of the key priorities of my role will be contributing to the direction of the new Planning Scheme, which will shape the liveability, sustainability and prosperity of the Sunshine Coast into the future. 

“I’m also very excited about the opportunity to shape Council’s approach to customer facing services and how we support our community through the planning and engagement work we do.

“Reinvigorating council’s relationship with key community stakeholders will be another major focus, along with finding opportunities for a customised approach to our development and community response services.” 

Ms Robinson will begin her new role on May 16, 2022.
