Local businesses or individuals with an innovative product or service can apply to exhibit their innovation at next month’s (September) [2022 Sunshine Coast Innovations Show](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Regional-innovation/Sunshine-Coast-Innovations-Day) [c](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Regional-innovation/Sunshine-Coast-Innovations-Day) [ase](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Regional-innovation/Sunshine-Coast-Innovations-Day)
&#x20;at the UniSC Innovation Centre.

The showcase is part of [Forward Festival](https://forwardfest.co/)
, a five-day event designed to transform how small businesses operate by unlocking the capacity of entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs\* and employees.  

In addition to the incredible exposure this event offers, the 10 businesses selected to participate will leave the event with a scripted and professionally filmed pitch video to promote their solution through marketing campaigns, proposals and social media.

Sunshine Coast Council Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said this exciting event had connected innovative Sunshine Coast businesses, intrapreneurs\* and entrepreneurs with key players across 25 different industries since 2019.

“This business development event is a launching pad for growth and innovation with the potential to transform how small businesses or start-ups operate by growing their networks and potential,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The showcase is an opportunity to benefit from the expertise of industry leaders and gain invaluable insight into how to remain agile in an ever-changing business landscape.

“The winning businesses will also be featured in the [Sunshine Coast Council Innovation e-book](https://cdn.flipsnack.com/widget/v2/widget.html?hash=hisr0a8unf)
&#x20;which council will share following the event, giving these businesses great exposure.”

Silicon Coast Director Renee Coman said while technology made connecting seem effortless, there was no substitute for being in the same room with other innovators.

“The Innovations Showcase is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate local innovative solutions and create collusions between people who would not traditionally meet, increasing the possibility and pathways to grow Sunshine Coast business exponentially, “Ms Coman said.
