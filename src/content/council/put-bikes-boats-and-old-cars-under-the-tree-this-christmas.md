In the words of [Oleta Adams](https://youtu.be/K2-yUQS70Kc)
, ‘I don’t care how you get here, just get here if you can’ could have been written for the [2023 Sunshine Coast Heritage Calendar](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Heritage-Calendar-2023)
.

The limited edition calendar features a stunning collection of images showing the various ways we’ve travelled the region over the decades.

The calendar is available from council libraries and customer contact centres and at just $6, makes the perfect gift for friends and loved ones.

The images featured throughout combine previously unseen submissions from local residents alongside offerings from council’s [Picture Sunshine Coast](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRNGEN/WPAC/PSC?HOMEPRMS=PSCPARAMS)
&#x20;heritage collection.

• Slim Moroney from Landsborough submitted an image of a Holden FX, Mary Cairncross, 2005, which appears on the front cover.

All images have been tinted with colour, a technique in keeping with the tradition of hand-colouring monochrome photographs which began in 1900.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said council received a brilliant range of images in response to its annual calendar competition.

“Images received showcase everything from bikes, boats and old cars and because these come from residents’ private collections, their inclusion makes the calendar a true-to-life depiction of Sunshine Coast life,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The stories, moving and still images that remain in the personal collections of our community members are by far the largest part of our region’s cultural heritage, and this calendar is a wonderful way to illustrate its significance and celebrate its value.

“The photos submitted will now be gratefully archived into council’s heritage library ‘[Picture Sunshine Coast’](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRNGEN/WPAC/PSC?HOMEPRMS=PSCPARAMS)
, a growing collection of more than 17,000 images showing the history and development of the Sunshine Coast.”

Council’s Picture Sunshine Coast database is easy to access via [council’s library website](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRNGEN/WPAC/PSC?HOMEPRMS=PSCPARAMS)
.
