Sunshine Coast Council today endorsed its Corporate Plan 2021-2025 which will guide council’s directions and priorities for the next five years.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the plan reinforced council’s continuing commitment to our vision for the Sunshine Coast, Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.

He said the new plan also focussed on long-term planning by considering community feedback provided through the development of our community, economic and environment strategies as well as consultation conducted on the Corporate Plan itself in late 2020.

“Liveability remains a key priority which was reflected in feedback provided by our community, along with the need to continue to provide a balanced and connected approach to planning for the future,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Council seeks to achieve this through everything we do, consistent with our vision for the Sunshine Coast.

“While there are many factors that contribute to the strength of our Sunshine Coast, council’s clear vision, forward thinking and strong commitments have played an important role in ensuring our services are responsive to the community’s needs and that we are positioning the region for the future.

“The essential role that council plays as the guardian of the wellbeing of our community will continue to be a key focus area as the region responds to the challenges presented by COVID-19,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This new Corporate Plan will guide the next five years of strategy and decision making, ensuring we are supporting and connecting our communities, preserving and nurturing our natural assets, developing a more resilient economy which delivers jobs, opportunities and services and, above all, remaining focused on maintaining a lifestyle that is so highly valued by our residents. 

“When you develop a clear plan and commit to seeing it delivered, you inspire confidence, which also inevitably produces results.”

The Corporate Plan advances council’s vision and aligns to our purpose to serve our community with excellence, respect our past, and position our region for the future. It presents five strategic goals that provide a balanced approach to council’s performance and are aligned to our councillor portfolio system:

1.  Our strong community
2.  Our environment and liveability
3.  Our resilient economy
4.  Our service excellence
5.  Our outstanding organisation
