We have created a new temporary beach access at Moffat Beach next to Eleanor Shipley Park.

It has a gentle slope to provide an alternative beach access (BA) for people who are unable to use stairs.

Previously, the concrete ramp in the carpark was being used for this purpose, but it was damaged during the seawall failure in 2022.

The surface of new BA273 is cement treated decomposed granite, which is similar to other beach access points and provides a hard base with a natural beach look.

The access was also widened to approximately two metres and fenced either side.

BA273 new temporary beach access at Moffat Beach next to Eleanor Shipley Park.

The final design to replace the damaged section of the Moffat Beach seawall will include ramp access.

We are waiting on the outcome of our grant application to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority before we can begin construction.
