Locals and visitors have been taking in the expansive easterly vistas and gathering to enjoy the lush open space of Buderim Village Park since it first opened in 2012.

The final stage of the community’s green pulse is just months away from being completed by Sunshine Coast Council.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford said it was a humbling experience to watch the park evolve since council purchased the property in 2010.

“It was a vacant 3.4 hectare piece of land on the corner of Church and King streets which needed a clear vision to transform it into a district-level recreation park,” Cr Hungerford said.

“To guide the park’s development, we asked the community to share their ideas and help shape the vision for Buderim Village Park.

“Since then, the park has blossomed in stages and has become part of the town’s identity, a place of nature, active and passive recreation experiences to be enjoyed by everyone of all abilities and ages.

“The path meanders around the Village Green to a spacious lookout offering expansive views of the coastline – a crowd favourite.

“There’s extensive grassy areas which provide lots of room for picnics, little legs to run wild, kick a ball or fly a kite. It’s also a wonderful place to sit quietly and relax.

“The barbecue areas are very popular and the covered stage-area has provided community groups and visitors a place to meet or perform.

“Stage 9 of this outstanding project is underway and will include a new playground with a shade sail, new shelter, park furniture, new pathways and landscaping works.

“The playground will feature a rainforest themed tower which is 6.5-metres-high and overlooks the play area. The tower features multiple sides, hammocks, sensory play and climbing elements.”

Other features include swings, seesaw, sand play, tipi carousel, lorikeet springer, log climber and tunnel, which provide a variety of play experiences including climbing, swinging, rocking and hanging.

This project is proudly funded by the Queensland Government’s South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program in association with Sunshine Coast Council.  

The Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to deliver for Buderim and the Sunshine Coast.

“The $100 million South East Queensland (SEQ) Community Stimulus Program is designed to help councils progress their investment in new infrastructure and community assets that create economic growth and jobs to local communities,” Ms Boyd said.

“Queensland, and especially the Sunshine Coast has a great lifestyle, and we’re proud to be making it even better with projects like this.

“By adding a new playground, seats, tables, and upgrading the existing facilities we’re not just making a great space for the local community, we’re delivering good jobs for locals too.

“Thanks to support from the program, Buderim will soon boast an even better space for kids to play and for the whole community to enjoy.”
