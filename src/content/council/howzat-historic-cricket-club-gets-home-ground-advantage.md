Spring is in the air – and that means cricket season is not far away!

There’s no better time to unveil upgrades to the 117-year-old Yandina Cricket Club’s clubhouse.

Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with the Queensland Government and Queensland Cricket, has delivered a sleek and modern clubhouse for the Yandina cricket community.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the $720,000 upgrade saw major improvements to this important community facility.

“This project involved a complete roof renewal which was fitted out with solar panels producing an estimated 10,200 kWh. That’s equivalent to powering more than 20 medium-sized household fridges for a year,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Sustainable upgrades to public facilities like these support our vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative.

“The upgrade includes internal renovations, new walls, water and sewerage connections which will give this venue a new lease of life.

“But most importantly the key driver behind this project is updating a facility which is inclusive for men and women.

“The project reconfigures change rooms to provide a unisex approach to design with dedicated umpire facilities. 

“The new facilities are first class and the upgrades reinforce our commitment to encourage women and girls to participate in sport, as well as supporting the needs of umpires and officials who are critical contributors to club sport.”

Division 10 Councillor David Law said the North Street, Yandina precinct had stood the test of time.

“The first game at the Yandina Cricket Club was in 1904 against Bli Bli. Now look at it. Hasn’t it come a long way in 117 years?” Cr Law said.

“Council contributed $200,000 to help deliver a fantastic facility that players can be proud of, and who knows, it might give them a strong home ground advantage. 

“The facility underwent major improvements to the façade, providing an improved experience for bowlers, batters, spectators and umpires.

“I want to also point out the facility was designed to support the multiple playing fields adjacent to the clubhouse, which is paramount in supporting popular and growing club numbers. 

“I congratulate the project team for providing a quality outcome and collaborating with the club to limit disruption to its operations, as well as achieving an outcome that will service the club for many years to come.”

The Queensland Government provided $500,000 towards this project under the COVID Works for Queensland Funding program.

Member for Nicklin Robert Skelton welcomed the opening of the upgraded Yandina Cricket Club.

“This is a great project for our community, with the new clubhouse bringing our community together when we need it the most,” Mr Skelton said.

“The Palaszczuk Government has invested $500,000 through the COVID Works for Queensland program, helping to drive jobs growth and delivering a much-needed new clubhouse.

“Queensland’s plan for economic recovery has already begun, with communities like ours benefiting with new local jobs and better local facilities.”

Queensland Cricket CEO Terry Svenson said that Queensland Cricket contributed $20,000 towards the clubhouse upgrade.

“Queensland Cricket is proud of its record of forming strong partnerships with government at all levels and this is highlighted by the quality outcome for the community and the Yandina Cricket Club”, said CEO Terry Svenson.

“The refurbished facility provides a clubhouse and change rooms that will help us meet the growing level of participants in cricket, particularly for our ever increasing numbers of female players.

“Through Queensland Cricket’s infrastructure funds we were able to allocate $20,000 to the significant and valuable contributions to the project by Council and the state government. 

“Queensland Cricket has, despite these challenging times, increased its financial commitment to infrastructure to record levels to ensure our clubs and volunteers have access to sustainable and safe facilities.”
