Love caravanning and camping by the ocean, but also enjoy the comforts of home?

Here is the ultimate idea, why not tow your van or pitch a tent at Sunshine Coast Council’s picturesque Coolum and Mudjimba Beach Holiday Parks.

Both beachside getaways now offer sustainable and accessible coastal-style amenities thanks to a more than $3 million investment by council.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said each park offered a home-away-from-home and were two of our region’s most peaceful holiday havens that could be enjoyed all year round.

“Two of council’s premium coastal holiday parks have received upgrades to the amenities facilities to ensure they remain contemporary and attractive for all our valued guests,” Cr Suarez said.

“The modern conveniences include two new amenities blocks with showers for all campers, including those living with a disability, and a laundry space to wash and dry.

“As we strive to become Australia’s most sustainable region it was paramount the buildings were equipped with solar power generation, battery storage and rainwater harvesting for use in flushing toilets.

“While campers enjoy soaking up the sun and salt air, the amenities building materials, fittings and fixtures have been chosen to withstand the coastal environment, achieve longevity and reduce maintenance costs.

“It’s great to see the works completed in time for the summer holiday season.”

The Caravan Industry Association of Australia *[Caravan and Camping State of Industry 2022](https://www.caravanindustry.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/State-of-Industry-Snippet-2022.pdf)
* report said 89 per cent of domestic caravan and camping trips took place in regional areas of Australia.

Sunshine Coast Council Tourism Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the new amenities had come at a time when caravan and camping was thriving.

“Many of us have felt the fluctuating economic impacts during the global pandemic, however one industry which remained resilient in a time of uncertainty was the caravan and camping industry,” Cr O’Pray said.

“The Caravan Industry report indicates visitor economy strongly rebounded from 2020, generating 12.6 million trips, more than 50 million nights, and $7.4 billion in visitor expenditure within Australia.

“Closer to home, the sunshine state recorded more than 200,000 registrations, 2.8 million domestic trips and had 11.6 million domestic nights which was the second highest in Australia behind New South Wales.

“These are outstanding results and shows why continual upgrades of holiday park assets is important in driving our local tourism.”

Coolum Beach Holiday Park

Next year, 19 powered sites will be upgraded towards the southern end of Coolum Beach Holiday Park. The works will start after school returns in January and are expected to be completed by the end of March 2023, weather permitting.

Coolum and Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park Manager Jason Filippini said the new upgrades had been well received since being completed.

“Park visitors have been looking forward to the upgrade for a long time and while it seems like a small convenience, it makes a big difference to their stay,” Mr Filippini said.  

“As a result of the pandemic, the industry has grown in the last two years and the popularity of caravanning and camping around Australia is massive and we have seen the results here locally. 

“Our holiday park visitation rates are up by 18.5 per cent in the last two years with an average length of stays 4.6 nights.

“Coolum and Mudjimba are both council-owned, dog-friendly family [holiday parks](https://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;and are located on quintessential Sunshine Coast patrolled surf beaches.

“Constant park improvements always add to a positive experience for the guests and I’m looking forward to seeing further site upgrades taking place at Coolum from late January next year.”
