The countdown to the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 is on with less than 100 days to kick off and Sunshine Coast is playing a starring role in one of the world’s greatest female sporting team’s preparations.

English football team the Lionesses will get their 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup campaign rolling on the Sunshine Coast.

They’ll be training at [Sunshine Coast Stadium](https://www.sunshinecoaststadium.com.au/sunshine-coast-stadium/)
&#x20;and staying at the Novotel Sunshine Coast Resort from Friday July 7, ahead of their World Cup opener against Haiti at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on July 22.

&#x20;Sunshine Coast Stadium, part of the Kawana Sports Precinct, is the planned venue for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games preliminary football matches.

The Lionesses are currently ranked fourth in the women’s world rankings and had their 30-match unbeaten run snapped on Tuesday (11 April) after a 2-0 loss to the Australian Matildas in England.

England head coach Sarina Wiegman said the team couldn’t wait to get out to Australia.

“It is great we know where we will continue our World Cup preparations and we are very happy to have this perfect combination of training ground and hotel,” Wiegman said.

“The work we do in the last weeks before the tournament will be essential for making sure we get off to a good start on 22 July.

“I was very impressed with what I saw when I visited Sunshine Coast Stadium just after the New Year."

“We will have everything we need on the pitch, as well as high performance gym and recovery facilities.

“We had such a warm welcome from all the people there which is also important. I know everyone will be behind the host nation, but we felt Sunshine Coast will feel like a home away from home for us.”

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was thrilled to welcome the Lionesses.

“We’re excited to host the European champions at Sunshine Coast Stadium as they prepare for the World Cup and bring more football content to the region, particularly ahead of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games where this same venue will co-host the Olympic Games football competition,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This is a fantastic opportunity to further position the Sunshine Coast as a premier destination for high performance sport and showcase our region and facilities to the world.”

Following their opening World Cup match, England will head to Terrigal, an hour north of Sydney, and set up camp for the rest of the tournament.
