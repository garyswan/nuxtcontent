A convoy of caravans, trailers and exhibitors are making their way to Nambour Showgrounds, which will be transformed into a camper’s paradise across three action-packed days from 9-11 April.

Tickets are now available for the South Queensland Caravan, Camping, Fishing and 4X4 Expo, which is a popular regular annual event at the showgrounds.  

Event organiser Bob Carroll said more than 120 exhibitors would be on display.

“They’ll be showcasing the very latest in camper trailers, caravans, motorhomes, four wheel drives and tourism destination information,” Mr Carroll said.

“This expo has everything anyone could possibly need to plan a holiday and enjoy the amazing destinations in Queensland including the Sunshine Coast.”

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the expo was a major drawcard for the region.

“Council has a number of venues and facilities to cater for these events and we’re proud Nambour Showgrounds continually hosts such a popular event,” Cr O’Pray said.

“After people have visited the expo they’re also more than welcome to visit our beachfront [holiday parks](http://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;to book their next holiday.”

Tickets to the expo, which opens at 8.30am each day, range from $12-$18. Children under 12 are free. For more information visit [caravancampingexpo.com.au](https://caravancampingexpo.com.au/)
