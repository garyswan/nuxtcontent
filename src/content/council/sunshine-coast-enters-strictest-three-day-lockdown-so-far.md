New rules in place make the current lockdown the strictest on record, but this is necessary in the interests of keeping our community safe.

The Sunshine Coast local government area is among 11 areas across south east Queensland entering a snap three-day lockdown from 4pm Saturday 31 July until 4pm Tuesday 3 August.

This is due to the emergence in the last 24-48 hours of a cluster in the community with the highly infectious Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus.

The Queensland Chief Health Officer has indicated that Queensland has not previously had to deal with a Delta variant outbreak and so for this reason, this will be the most restrictive lockdown we’ve had since the start of the pandemic.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor and Local Disaster Management Group chair Mark Jamieson said this intensive lockdown is vital to detect as quickly as possible, if there are further positive cases in the community and to minimise the risk of community transmission. 

Under the directives issued by the Queensland Chief Health Officer, residents can only leave their home (which includes temporary accommodation such as a holiday rental) for limited permitted purposes such as:

• obtaining essential goods or services within 10 kilometres, including healthcare (including vaccinations)

• exercise (within a 10-kilometre radius from home)

• attending essential work or childcare or school for the children of essential workers

• assisting vulnerable persons

• obtaining a COVID-19 test or vaccination.

Under the new lockdown directions, no visitors are allowed to your residence (excluding volunteers and workers), unless providing support to a vulnerable person.

Sunshine Coast residents are strongly encouraged to regularly visit Queensland Health’s website to keep up to date on the full details on restrictions in south east Queensland and to check the list of exposure sites, which is constantly being updated.

Mayor Jamieson urged residents and visitors to comply with Queensland Health directions including handwashing, social distancing, checking in to any venues that you have to visit for essential purposes using the Queensland Government QR code and get tested if you have even the slightest of symptoms.

“Given the particularly virulent strain of the COVID-19 virus that has been detected in south east Queensland, it is vital everyone complies with the Queensland Chief Health Officer’s directions.

“There is no room for complacency with any of this and I am asking everyone to again do their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19.”

“Information is being updated regularly as new details come to light.

“We also want everyone to follow all of the steps that we have all become familiar with now in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

**Masks**

You must always wear a face mask when you leave home, including outdoors and for exercise, unless you have a lawful reason not to.

You must wear a mask in indoor spaces, such as:
