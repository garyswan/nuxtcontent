Congratulations to Caloundra West sisters Aleea, Shyla and Laiken, who now know a whole lot more about preparing for disasters.

The trio scored a $1500 four person evacuation kit by winning the passport competition at the Emergency Services and Disaster Preparedness Expo.

To enter, they visited stalls hosted by Sunshine Coast Council and emergency services, answering questions to collect stamps on their passport.

You can also prepare for severe weather and emergency events to keep yourself and your loved ones safe.

Remember, disaster can strike anytime, anywhere and it’s not a matter of if, but when.

There are just three simple steps to ensure your household or business is prepared.

Step one: Have an emergency plan in place.

Step two: Pack supplies – pack your emergency and evacuation kits.

Step three: Make sure your insurance has adequate coverage and is up-to-date.

Visit council’s [Disaster Hub website](https://disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;to find the latest updates, practical resources and what to do before, during and after an emergency.

Thanks to the Queensland Government’s Get Ready Queensland program for supporting this competition.
