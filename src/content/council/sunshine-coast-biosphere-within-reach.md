The Sunshine Coast Council’s nomination for the region to become a UNESCO Biosphere has reached its final destination.

After having been considered by the Queensland and Australian governments, the nomination has now arrived in Paris for UNESCO’s consideration.

 A biosphere is a special place and it is Council’s intention that a Sunshine Coast Biosphere will become an exemplar of people and nature in harmony and which embeds the values of our community in our long-term planning as our region continues to grow over the next 20 years.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said all of council’s regional strategies, planning and programs supported our bid for the region to become a biosphere.

“Our community has given us a consistent message – protect and maintain our region’s liveability and natural assets while ensuring there are sustainable opportunities for our future,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“A biosphere credential will help us continue doing that.

“I made commitments to the residents of our Sunshine Coast in both 2016 and 2020 that I would work with my colleagues to advance a Biosphere nomination for our region to UNESCO so I am delighted that this final point in the journey has been reached.

“The nomination highlights the priority we place on ensuring the economic, social and environmental needs of our region today are advanced, without compromising the ability to meet the needs of our future generations.

“I’m also proud our nomination has been shaped by the Sunshine Coast community through our extensive consultation process and the help of our dedicated Community Reference Group, the members of which partnered with council in 2019 to develop the nomination.

“A biosphere is a natural fit for the Sunshine Coast, as its values encompass those of our community, and our council’s vision: Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.

“Our council now looks forward with anticipation, on the outcome of UNESCO’s assessment, which is anticipated in June 2022.”
