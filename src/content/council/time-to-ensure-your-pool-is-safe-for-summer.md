The air is getting warmer, the days are getting longer and the flowers are in bloom, which means summer is fast-approaching!

Make sure your pool is ready for action and do your spring pool safety check.

Council provides regulations that requires all swimming pool barriers to be compliant.

Swimming pool owners must undertake regular checks on their spas, swimming pools, portable and inflatable swimming pools to ensure compliance is upheld.

The Queensland pool safety standards regulate the height and strength of barriers, non-climbable zones, gate latching requirements and preventing direct access from a building into a pool area.

Pools capable of holding more than 300mm in depth, must comply with the Queensland pool safety standard.

To ensure your pool is compliant:

*   check you have a building approval, and
*   get advice from a pool safety inspector about how to ensure your pool complies or
*   Contact a pool safety inspector to do a formal inspection with a view to getting a pool safety certificate.

Be sure your swimming pool is summer ready by visiting council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Building-and-Plumbing/Swimming-Pools)
 or the [Queensland Building and Construction Commission](http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/home-building-owners/pool-safety/overview)
 website for more information about pool safety compliance.
