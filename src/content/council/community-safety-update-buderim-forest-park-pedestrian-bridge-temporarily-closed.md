Important maintenance works are underway on Serenity Bridge in Buderim Forest Park, limiting access to some walking trails.

The bridge will be closed for several weeks to allow council workers to assess its condition and schedule and carry out repairs.

Further investigations are required to determine the extent of the work required and to determine a long-term solution.

Routine council inspections revealed weaknesses in the structure including some rotting wood.

The bridge is not currently safe for pedestrian traffic and everyone is advised to comply with barricades and safety signs that are in place.

Sunshine Coast Council natural areas manager Adam Connell said the safety of our community was of the utmost importance to council.

“Council understands that the area is very popular for outdoor enthusiasts and access will be maintained to walking tracks and water holes where safe access can be maintained for pedestrians,” Mr Connell said.

A section of the loop track to the western end of the bridge accessed via Quorn Close will be closed, however access to the falls via the eastern track, and through access between Quorn Close and Harrys Lane will remain open.

Barricades and signs will be in place to advise pedestrians of track and bridge closures. Park users must comply with all signage.

Council will keep the community informed as investigations are completed and council thanks the community for their cooperation.
