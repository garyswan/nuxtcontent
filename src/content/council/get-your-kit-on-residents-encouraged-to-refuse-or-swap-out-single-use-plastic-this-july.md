As Plastic Free July kicks off around the globe, Sunshine Coast Council is encouraging residents to ‘Get Your Kit On’ and make a plastic-free pledge this month.

As well as joining millions of people in a feel-good movement to reduce plastic pollution, locals will also have the chance to win a whale watching experience for the whole family.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said there were a number of ways for locals to get involved in Plastic Free July this year, such as registering for the [Plastic Free July Challenge](https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/take-the-challenge/)
&#x20;or attending a range of workshops and events.

“Here on the Sunshine Coast, we’re consistently seeing increased community awareness and activity around the issue of single use plastics,” Cr Suarez said.

“It’s inspiring to see so many residents, businesses and organisations taking positive action this year to reduce their impact and protect our [Sunshine Coast Biosphere](https://oursc.com.au/featured/sunshine-coast-officially-becomes-a-unesco-biosphere)
.

“Sustainable living forms a key part of council’s [Environment and Liveability Strategy 2017](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Environment-and-Liveability-Strategy-2017)
&#x20;and initiatives such as Plastic Free July provide locals with an opportunity to contribute to a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast.

“From beeswax wrap workshops to beach clean-ups, Plastic Free July is also a great time for the community to come together on the issue of waste reduction and learn something new in a fun and friendly environment.

“This is my third year taking part in Plastic Free July and I’m excited to embrace some new ideas to reduce my single-use plastic consumption.

“I don’t drink coffee so haven’t had to worry about reusable coffee cups and I’ve definitely mastered the habit of taking my reusable water bottle wherever I go, so this year my focus is on creating new habits with food such as refusing disposable cutlery and using alternatives to glad wrap.

“I still have challenges going plastic free with my bread and cheese purchases and it’ll be a work in progress to find a solution for those in time for next year’s pledge!

“With so many great reusable products and tips to choose from, I encourage everyone to make a plastic free pledge this month and adopt a new sustainable habit that either reduces or eliminates the consumption of single-use plastic items.

“Whether it’s going completely plastic free or cutting out one item, it’s great to make a pledge that’s both realistic and sustainable for the months and years to come, so we can continue to make a positive impact.

“Visit the Living Smart website at [www.livingsmart.qld.com.au](http://www.livingsmart.qld.com.au/)
&#x20;for full details on Plastic Free July events. Or, simply share with us how you’re taking part by using #PlasticFreeSCC.”

From July 1-31, Sunshine Coast locals can share how they’re reducing single use plastics on social media to go in the running to win a [Whale One](https://www.whaleone.com.au/whales/watching/)
&#x20;adventure or a [Go For Zero Plastic Free Kit](https://goforzero.com.au/products/go-for-zero-plastic-free-july-box-limited-edition?_pos=1&_sid=bb432bd46&_ss=r)
.
