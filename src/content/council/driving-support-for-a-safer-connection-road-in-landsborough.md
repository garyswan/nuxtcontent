Motorists travelling between Mooloolah Valley and Landsborough will soon have a smoother and safer road thanks to the Australian Government’s Black Spot Program.

Sunshine Coast Divisional Councillor Rick Baberowski said changes to traffic conditions including a temporary diversion, would be required while council widened and rehabilitated a stretch of Tunnel Ridge Road, between Rose and Kowald Road, Landsborough.

Motorists should check the notice and allow additional travel time while temporary alternative routes are in place via Steve Irwin Way and Connection Road from 22 March.

“Keeping drivers safe on local roads is a priority for council,” Cr Baberowski said.

“This project will remove identified roadside hazards, install safety barriers and widen this constrained section of road, as a response to the pattern of crashes at this location and is designed to significantly reduce the severity if there are future crashes. 

“The upgrade will see additional area cleared to the appropriate standards, providing adequate space in case motorists leave the road and allow Tunnel Ridge Road to be widened to eight metres.

“Trees will be planted elsewhere to offset any removed throughout the road widening, which is all part of council’s commitment to environmental sustainability.”

Divisional Councillor Winston Johnston urged motorists to leave home a few minutes earlier during the construction period to allow for the temporary changes to traffic conditions.

Tunnel Ridge Road will be closed between Rose Road and Kowald Road from Monday 22 March until early May, weather and construction conditions permitting.

Local resident access will be maintained throughout the project. Reduced speed limits and signage will be in place to direct motorists.

“I look forward to improved road safety for the local community. I’m also asking for your patience and perseverance during this time, while we deliver the upgrade,” Cr Johnston said.

“Tunnel Ridge Road will be closed between Rose and Kowald roads during the works, for the safety of motorists and road workers.

“What this means is residents can continue to access their properties but all other traffic will be directed to use the detour while work is underway.

“We are working with the community to minimise impacts. Alternative routes will be in place via Steve Irwin Way and Connection Road and council has provided advance notice to motorists.

“We need to close this section of Tunnel Ridge Road to widen it to eight meters, so we can minimise the duration, cost and environmental footprint of the project, and it’s also vital we maximise safety.”

Sunshine Coast Council offers a free online tool to help motorists better navigate local roads.
