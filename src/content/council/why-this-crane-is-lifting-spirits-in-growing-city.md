The arrival of a 40-metre crane on the construction site for the new multi-deck parking facility in the Maroochydore City Centre has been welcomed by Sunshine Coast Council.

The eight-storey car park with 295 paid parking spaces, including accessible parking and electric vehicle charging spaces plus 39 motorcycle and 28 bicycle spaces, is on schedule to be completed in December 2023 (subject to weather and material availability).

The facility is expected to cost $22.5 million and involve more than 500 workers during the construction phase.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the crane’s arrival marked another milestone in the commercial heart of the Maroochydore city centre.

“The project is progressing well with the help of state-of-the-art equipment and a highly skilled team of construction professionals,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Work completed to date includes bulk earthworks, 60 deep foundation piles, footings and ground services.

"The next phase of the project will include the construction of the 8-level concrete structure.

“The building will incorporate sustainability elements, including rooftop solar panels, end-of-trip facilities for active transport users, electric vehicle charging stations and connection to Australia’s first, high-technology underground automated waste collection system.”

Walker Corporation Director, Development and Major Projects Peter Saba said the multi-deck carpark will be a great addition to the fast-growing Maroochydore City Centre. 

“As the new city centre continues its rapid transformation, we are proud to be delivering convenient car parking and high-quality end of trip facilities on behalf of the Council,” Mr Saba said.

“Existing workers in the CBD as well as those who will occupy our future premium office tower, 50 First Avenue, will love being able to leave their car, or bike, in a safe and accessible location.”

Parking fees for this facility will be considered by council as part of Council’s normal budget process.

The [Maroochydore City Centre Priority Development Area](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Maroochydore-City-Centre)
&#x20;is being delivered through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council, SunCentral Maroochydore Pty Ltd and Walker Maroochydore Developments Pty Ltd. The agreement will see up to $2.5 billion of private sector investment flow into the project.
