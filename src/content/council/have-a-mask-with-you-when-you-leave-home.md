As Greater Brisbane (i.e. the local government areas of Brisbane City, Moreton Bay, Ipswich, Redlands and Logan) begins a three-day lock down from 5pm, Monday 29 March 2021, Sunshine Coast residents are urged to follow the Chief Health Officer’s directive to carry a face mask at all times when you leave home and to wear a face mask in indoor spaces, in accordance with Queensland Health advice.

Anyone who has been in Greater Brisbane since 8am on Saturday 20 March 2021 but has since returned to the Sunshine Coast is also required to follow the same lock down rules as for Greater Brisbane.

That includes staying at home except for four reasons – if you are carrying out essential work which cannot be undertaken from home, buying essential food and medical supplies, accessing or assisting with healthcare or exercising in your local area with people from your own home or with one other person.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said that given the particularly virulent strain of the COVID-19 virus that has been detected in community transmission cases in Brisbane, it is vital everyone complies with the Chief Health Officer’s directions. 

“There is no room for complacency with any of this and I am asking everyone to again do their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It is absolutely essential that anyone who has been in Greater Brisbane since Saturday 20 March at 8am follow the same lock down requirements in place for Greater Brisbane,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We also want everyone to follow all of the steps that we have all become familiar with now in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19:

*   Stay home if you are sick
*   If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, get tested
*   Stay 1.5 metres away from other people—think two big steps
*   Wash your hands with soap and water, or hand sanitiser
*   Leave a location if it is crowded.”

Queensland Health have also advised private gatherings indoors and outdoors in areas outside Greater Brisbane (like the Sunshine Coast) are now limited to 30 people.

“I ask anyone who has been in Brisbane since 8am on Saturday 20 March to not attend any events on the Sunshine Coast during the lock down period,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our Sunshine Coast residents and businesses know what to do, we’ve been through this before and it’s again time to come together to keep our community safe.

“Please be respectful and kind to each other. 

Children under 12 years and people affected by a medical condition or disability are exempt from wearing a mask.

The community is also reminded to sign-in when visiting places like cafes and restaurants, and to provide accurate contact details.

Sunshine Coast Council is continuing to regularly service public facilities to keep residents and visitors as safe as possible and the community is asked to practise good hyenine when using council facilities, including barbecues. 

Customers who have been in Greater Brisbane since 20 March 2021 should not be visiting Council venues during the lock down period as they are required to stay at home.

Customers who need to contact council are encouraged to do so via the phone or online if possible, rather than visiting a counter.

Customers can call our locally-based call centre on 5475 7272 or 1300 007 272 during business hours (8.15am – 5pm) Monday to Friday. After hours, our call centre takes emergency calls.
