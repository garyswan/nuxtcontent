Services, community and sustainability are at the heart of Sunshine Coast Council’s budget this year, with projects, programs and events being delivered across the region.

The first billion-dollar budget in the history of the Sunshine Coast Council will “deliver now and for the future’’.

Foreshore transformations, traffic-busting road improvements, a new district library, world-class sporting precincts and preserving and celebrating the environment are key inclusions in the newly adopted 2023-24 budget.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said this year’s $1 billion budget demonstrated Council’s unwavering commitment to shaping a stronger, better and more sustainable region.

“This is a budget that will deliver now and for the future, investing in projects that will enrich how we live, work and play,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It will maintain the high quality of services our community deserves and enjoys and factors in the rising costs associated with materials and labour, a challenge facing industries, organisations and governments everywhere.

“The investments contained in this budget will secure jobs into the future, work to repair the impacts of extreme weather, encourage people of all ages and capabilities to be more active, help us better enjoy our wonderful outdoor lifestyle, and preserve our environmental assets.

“In developing the 2023-24 Budget we have taken a thoughtful and balanced approach, minimising rate and levy increases to assist our community with the challenges associated with cost-of-living pressures.”

## Wave of exciting projects rolls in

Mayor Jamieson said the Capital Works Program for 2023-24 would be $331 million.

“This includes support for a number of major long-awaited projects, some delivered with contributions from the State and Federal Government, that will vastly improve the way we move around the Sunshine Coast and give us easier access to business and lifestyle centres like Mooloolaba and Caloundra.

“Lifestyle, the beautification of our hinterland and coastal towns, and community connectivity are also going to enjoy considerable investment.’’

## Highlights include:

*   More than $21 million invested in the region’s new

    [district library](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/major-regional-projects/caloundra-cbd-project/create-caloundra)


    at Caloundra, which is part of a vibrant

    [creative community hub](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/major-regional-projects/caloundra-cbd-project/create-caloundra)


      that will create a wonderful centrepiece for locals and help activate the vital coastal town and surrounding communities.

*   More than $21 million invested to upgrade the Nambour waste precinct at Bli Bli, to sustainably manage our future waste and take another step towards our goal to become a zero-net emissions organisation by 2041.

*   [The Mooloolaba Central Meeting Place](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/infrastructure-projects/mfr-project)


    , a place where our community can gather, celebrate and connect with nature and each other, will receive an investment of $7 million.

*   The final section of the

    [Brisbane Road upgrade](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/infrastructure-projects/mooloolaba-transport-corridor-upgrade/about-mooloolaba-transport-corridor-upgrade)


    in Mooloolaba will be built, between Kyamba Court and Tuckers Creek Bridge, thanks to funds totalling $5.5 million.

*   More than $5 million will flow to improve road safety and reduce congestion and advance the

    [Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Caloundra-Transport-Corridor-Upgrade-Project)


    .

*   A $6 million investment in a new attractive streetscape that will soon transform First Avenue, Maroochydore, into a vibrant, shaded and inclusive CBD, providing businesses, residents and visitors a more inviting space to live, work and play.

*   Almost $3 million to finalise placemaking and streetscape works in Eumundi Town Centre.   

*   Beautifying Maleny’s main street and historic Landsborough’s streetscapes, along with and enhancing Mary Cairncross and the Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Gardens have also attracted significant funding.

*   Hinterland areas worst hit by landslips during last year’s weather events, including Bald Knob, Wootha, Glenview, Eudlo, Peachester, Montville and Maleny, will receive more than $40 million to rebuild and rectify damages thanks to the Australian and Queensland governments’ Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements.

*   $24 million has been allocated to key sporting projects, including the evolution of the Honey Farm Road Sports Precinct, Kawana Waters Regional Aquatic Centre and expansion of Sunshine Coast Stadium.

## Cost-effective and responsible budget

Mayor Jamieson said that despite the challenges our region had faced over the past few years, Council was forecast to achieve a strong operating result of $24.6 million.

“This will enable continued investment in the capital program and repaying debt, while ensuring Council remains in a position to continue to deliver for the community,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We are maintaining our focus on fiscal responsibility, delivering services in a cost-effective and responsive manner and managing our community assets for current and future generations.

“We have also been mindful of the expectations of our community and the standard of services they seek from our Council.

“We have focused on minimising the rate increase, and balancing this with the challenge of accommodating the increasing costs of delivering infrastructure and services.

“We are maintaining our focus on fiscal responsibility, delivering services in a cost-effective and responsive manner and managing our community assets for current and future generations.

Mayor Jamieson said Council recognised that a number of residents were finding it difficult to make ends meet as cost-of-living pressures intensified.

“Council has worked hard to keep the minimum general rate increase for owner-occupiers to below CPI.

“The majority of owner-occupied properties will see a $1.42 per week increase in their general rate. This 5.55% increase is below CPI.

“Anyone experiencing financial hardship can contact Council before their rates are due and arrange a payment-by-instalments agreement over a six-month period to 31 December, without interest being charged.”

## Rate changes at a glance

*   Rates for the owner-occupiers on the minimum general rate – the majority of residential properties – will increase by $74 ($1.42 per week) to $1,406.50 per annum - a 5.55% rise
*   The environment levy will increase by $2 to $82
*   The Transport Levy will increase by $2 to $47
*   The Arts and Heritage Levy will increase by $2 to $18
*   A 240 litre wheelie bin service charge will increase by $27.60 to $360.30
*   Overall, rates and charges for the majority of owner occupiers on the minimum general rate will increase by $107.60 to $1913.80 - or 5.96%

All eligible pensioners will benefit from a 7% increase in their pensioner rate concession.

Sole homeowners on full pensions will receive a $290 annual concession (up from $271 in 2022-23) and those with joint title to the property will receive a maximum of $227 per annum (up from $212).

Those on part pensions will also benefit, with their annual concession increasing to maximums of $145 and $83 (single and joint title), increasing from $136 and $77 last financial year.

## Emphasis on liveability and sustainability

“We are building the future prosperity and liveability of our region, keeping an emphasis on sustainability in all forms,” Mayor Jamieson said.

Council’s Environment Levy, paid by all ratepayers, will rise $2 a year to $82.

Raising $12.5 million, the Environment Levy will be invested in protecting and enhancing our valued natural environment, including our native plants and animals, waterways and wetlands and coastal environments. 

The Environment Levy will continue to support the expansion and management of Council’s conservation estate for a range of habitat preservation, catchment management and coastal rehabilitation projects.

"There are now 7,866 hectares of conservation estate across the Sunshine Coast, including 407 hectares purchased through the Environment Levy in this term of Council," Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our Council is leading the way to be a zero net emissions organisation and for the community to be low carbon by 2041.”

Connecting our communities and encouraging travel behaviour change will also be front and centre of the work delivered with the proceeds of the Transport Levy, which also rises by $2 to $47.

Raising $7.1 million, the Transport Levy will support Council’s contribution to the development of the detailed business case for the Sunshine Coast Public Transport project being led by the Department of Main Roads.

It will also progress the implementation of the five-year travel change behaviour program, improve bus stops and support two Flexilink services as well as the Council Link service for eligible pensioners travelling to their nearest centre.

The Arts and Heritage Levy will increase by $2 to $18 to raise more than $2.5 million.

This will further support the [Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018-2038](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Sunshine-Coast-Arts-Plan)
, which develops and delivers projects to provide career pathways for local emerging artists.

It also underpins the [Sunshine Coast Heritage Plan 2021–2031](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Sunshine-Coast-Heritage-Plan)
, which backs new research into regional stories; conserves our region’s heritage assets, including State Heritage-listed Bankfoot House and its nationally significant collection; and supports our region’s community museums and heritage organisations through grants, practical workshops, professional development, community programs, collaborative marketing and events.

## Transitory (short stay accommodation) rate changes

Mayor Jamieson said one of the greatest challenges both the community and Council had grappled with recently was the many previous long term rental homes and units now being used for short stay accommodation.

“This has contributed to the longer term rental shortage on the Sunshine Coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“And we are not the only local government facing this challenge - many long term renters and communities across the world have felt the impacts.

“To remain consistent with other south east Queensland tourism destinations, short stay accommodation properties have been reviewed and benchmarked, resulting in rate increases comparable to those of other local government organisations.

“We wanted to encourage owners to leave properties in, or return them to, the long-term rental market.”

Property owners have the option to return their properties to the longer-term rental market and reduce their rates should they choose to.
