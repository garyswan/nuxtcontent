Enjoy numerous pathways and a vegetation variety through this 21 hectare bush reserve in central Caloundra!

**SUITABILITY**

A very family friendly and central piece of peacefulness with toilets, electric BBQ, tables, huts and bitumen parking.

**HIGHLIGHTS**

This hidden gem is so close to town, yet feels like a natural bushland track.

There are about a DOZEN interesting trails through this gorgeous park ranging from 800m to 1100m return. (See maps at the Queen St entrance.) Start with the perimeter loop through several different vegetation zones including a rich rainforest. Other flora you'll encounter include: eucalyptus Melaleuca woodland, paperbarks, dry and wet heath, giant Tallowwood and Bribie Island Pines.

The park is also a great place for bird watching and because of the botanical species in the park, it’s part of the Sunshine Coast Wildflower Festival held each August.

**AFTERWARDS**

Head to Kings Beach for a swim or the The Esplanade at Caloundra for refreshments – both locations are close by and part of the Sunshine Coast Coastal Pathway, which you can walk or cycle.

**HOW TO GET THERE**

Five to 10 minute walk for many Caloundra residents, find the entry off Queens Street just past Caloundra High School where there is a sign for Ben Bennett Bushland Park.

If driving, the trail entry is located just east of Nicklin Way, accessed from Queen Street. On the left hand side as you are going up the hill, just past Caloundra High School there is a sign for Ben Bennett Bushland Park. There you will see bitumen parking spaces and an information board.
