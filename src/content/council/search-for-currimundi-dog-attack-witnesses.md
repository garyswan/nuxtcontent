Did you witness or assist in the separation of dogs during an alleged dog attack in the off-leash beach area near Robe Street at Currimundi (beach access 256) at approximately 6pm on April 21?

Council is investigating an alleged dog attack and is hoping to obtain any further information or witnesses to the incident.

Two dogs allegedly attacked a black Labrador which sustained injuries and required about 60 stitches.

Being involved in a dog attack can be a frightening experience, both for the dog, its owner and witnesses.

In this instance council understands a male person assisted and separated the dogs.

Council would like to speak with the male person who provided assistance or any other witnesses to the attack to get more details about the event.

If you witnessed the attack, or if you know the male person involved in separating the dogs, please contact council on 5475 7272.
