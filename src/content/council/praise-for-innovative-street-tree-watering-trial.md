Sunshine Coast Council’s innovative pilot project diverting storm water to street trees in Golden Beach and Currimundi has been commended at a recent State-wide awards night.

Stormwater Queensland Excellence Awards on Thursday 4 February presented council with a Commendation for Excellence in Research and Innovation.

Divisional councillor Terry Landsberg said the award recognised council advancing its vision as Australia’s Most Sustainable Region. Healthy. Smart. Creative. The trial started in May 2020 and is showing promising results.

“We were honoured to see the project acknowledged and highly commended,” Cr Landsberg said.

“It’s another great example of council challenging traditional thinking.

“The Storm Watered Street Tree Trial diverts stormwater from our roads and kerbs by cutting the kerb and channel and diverting part of the flow towards the roots of the street trees. 

“We are trialling a variety of tree species with the different design concepts.  

“This delivers water and nutrients directly to the trees which can improve growth and survival rates and reduce maintenance costs and the amount of treated water used.

“Golden Beach is the first suburb on the Sunshine Coast to trial the functional, cost-effective and sustainable watering solution.

“Council is monitoring and learning from the trial to improve and adapt the project to suit other locations.”
