Sunshine Coast Council’s in-demand beachfront holiday parks are sold out for the first week of the Easter school holidays.

But in good news for those who have left bookings to the last minute, a handful of spots are up for grabs for families wanting to enjoy a staycation between 12-18 April.

The [holiday parks](http://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;are located at Dicky Beach, Mooloolaba, Maroochydore, Cotton Tree, Mudjimba and Coolum and start from just $66\* for powered caravan sites.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said people would need to get in quick to enjoy a relaxing holiday on the spectacular Sunshine Coast.

“Our holiday parks are the jewel in the crown for many visitors, so start rigging up the caravan and pack the swimmers for a tropical holiday on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr O’Pray said.

“And we know our own residents love to have a holiday close to home as well.

“We haven’t forgotten about your ‘furbabies’ too, which are allowed at select holiday parks on application.”

Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park secured a $620,000 upgrade late last year, with 31 existing sites now fully serviced.

It now offers guests 127 fully serviced slab sites, 70 fully serviced grass sites and 10 unpowered grass sites.

It also features three villas, a swimming pool, three amenities buildings, laundry facilities and free wi-fi.

While you’re holidaying in the area, why not check out Sunshine Coast Council’s [Beaches and Parks directory](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Beaches-and-Parks/Beaches-and-Parks-Directory)
&#x20;which features detailed information on council’s more than 300 barbecues, 220 beach access points, 35 dog exercise areas (fenced and unfenced), seven community gardens, 1145 parks and 350 playgrounds.
