How do you use your local park? Do you walk the dog, ride a bike, picnic or play?

Our parks are special to many people for many reasons.

This is your last chance to tell us what you love about your local Sunshine Coast Council park!

The feedback period for council’s new Draft Recreation Parks Plan has been extended to 16 April, so be sure to have your say online or come along to a pop-up session.

It’s been created to outline the strategic direction for parks across the region for our future.

We are trying to understand how locals use our parks so we can give you the best outdoor experiences and facilities you'll use for years to come.

All survey responses go in the draw to WIN one of 3 x $50 Rebel Sport gift cards, so [have your say today](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R5K59FS)
