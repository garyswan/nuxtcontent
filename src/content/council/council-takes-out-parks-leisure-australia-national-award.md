Sunshine Coast Council has been once again recognised for its strategic planning work, taking home the Best Strategic and Master Planning Award at the Parks and Leisure Australia National Awards of Excellence. The award recognises Council’s development of the *Sunshine Coast Recreation Parks Plan 2021-2031.*

The recently developed *Sunshine Coast Recreation Parks Plan 2021-2031* is a roadmap for parks on the Sunshine Coast. The planning tool supports Council’s commitment to preserve spaces and parks to promote a healthy lifestyle and environment on the Sunshine Coast.

Endorsed by Council in December 2021 and awarded at a state level in June 2022, the Recreation Parks Plan will assist park planners and managers within council and the development industry to design and deliver recreation parks that achieve council’s strategic goals. It will also assist the community in understanding how, why and where council locates park activities and infrastructure that supports their recreation.

The Recreation Parks Plan is one of many ways council is delivering on its [Environment and Liveability](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;Strategy (ELS), which provides long-term direction to guide growth and shape a sustainable future for our region.

The plan demonstrates council’s intention to enhance the variety of services that recreation parks provide for Sunshine Coast communities to complement the region’s character and lifestyle. The plan was created to ensure that community values are always reflected in our design, management, operations and maintenance of parks.

Whether you’re picnicking, exploring playgrounds, connecting with nature, improving your fitness or celebrating a special occasion – our Sunshine Coast parks connect with each of us in many different ways.
