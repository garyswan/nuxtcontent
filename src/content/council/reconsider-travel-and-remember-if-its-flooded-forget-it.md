Sunshine Coast Council is assessing the impacts of significant rainfall and localised flash flooding from heavy rainfall overnight.

Residents are urged to avoid all unnecessary travel. If travel is absolutely necessary, drive carefully and to the conditions – never drive through flood waters. Significant rainfall is expected to continue for the next three days and some parts of the Sunshine Coast have received more than 300mm over the last 24 hours.

Residents can expect more rain all week and are being urged not to be complacent if there is no rain, as rivers could still rise very quickly and roads could still be flooded.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Acting Chair Deputy Mayor Rick Baberowski praised the work of Sunshine Coast Council crews and emergency services who are busy responding to the situation.

“They are working hard for our community, undertaking urgent works, clearing debris and installing road closures,” Cr Baberowski said.

“You can help keep them, yourself and your loved ones safe by staying off the roads when possible and please never drive through flood waters.

“The grounds are saturated so unfortunately we anticipate flooding to get worse. Water depths are deceptive and will get worse.

“If it’s flooded, forget it.

“An evacuation centre has been opened at [Nambour Showgrounds](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Facilities/Nambour-Showgrounds)
&#x20;and able to accept people and animals.”

Cr Baberowski said the Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group (LDMG) moved to ‘Stand Up’ at 5am this morning (Wednesday, February 23) and was keeping a close eye on the situation.

Kenilworth was earlier isolated due to flood waters and council worked closely with the Queensland Police Service and the Kenilworth LDMG sub-group to provide any support required.

As of 7.30am minor flood levels had been exceeded at Palmwoods, Eumundi, Doonan Creek, Mountain Creek and Nambour. Eudlo is also expected to reach minor flood level.  

Moderate Flood Levels are imminent at Currimundi and Lake Kawana.

More information and details on road closures can be found on council’s Disaster Hub website  <https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au>
