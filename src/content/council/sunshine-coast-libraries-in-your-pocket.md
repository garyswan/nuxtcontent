Did you know Sunshine Coast Council Libraries have a convenient, time-saving app for library customers?

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said our library services were very popular among the Sunshine Coast community and the app makes accessing our suite of resources more convenient.

“The Libraries app means you can now carry the library service in your pocket,” Cr Law said.

“With faster access to your account, the app allows you to explore the library catalogue, browse new releases, renew loans and reserve your favourite titles for collection.

“You can also search the What’s On calendar, register for events and find endless activities for kids, teens and adults to enjoy – all at your fingertips.

“New customers are also encouraged to sign up to enjoy the extensive eLibrary collection which includes eBooks, eAudiobooks, eMagazines, movies, music and more, all for free.

“And for convenience, the app can link your account with other family memberships, including children, making it even easier for whole family to read, watch, listen and learn with Sunshine Coast Libraries.”

To find out how the app could benefit you, visit [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About-Libraries/App](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About-Libraries/App)
.

**How to download the app:**

The app is available now from Google Play for Android smart devices, or the App Store for iPhone and iPad users – just search for *‘Sunshine Coast Libraries’* and download it for free.
