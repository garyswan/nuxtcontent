A new $5.5 million waste facility for Bells Creek, start of detailed design of a significant two-lane upgrade to Johnston Road, Glass House Mountains and upgrades to numerous roads, playgrounds and parks are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 1.

Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects with the important aim to create a safer, secure future across the region.

“Our community understands we need to increase our collective commitment to divert more waste from landfill and the $5.5 million extension to the landfill site at Bells Creek, Caloundra will necessarily extend the capacity at the existing facility to cater for built-in growth in the region,” Cr Baberowski said.

“In addition, $200,000 will be invested in the design of a new Bio Basin at the Caloundra Landfill to ensure the outflowing water quality and will be constructed in subsequent years.

“I’m very pleased to announce that important planning work will begin for a major civic centre at Bells Creek to incorporate a community facility, town plaza and open space.

“Council will also spend more than $1.3 million to continue upgrading roads across Division 1 in 2021/22.

“We’re also continuing to make great progress on building a truly remarkable network of family-friendly parks and this financial year we’ll see upgrades to facilities at Newell Park, Peace Park and Gowen Drive park at Landsborough.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
