If you love camping, caravanning and the great outdoors, then this event is not to be missed.

The 2023 Nambour Expo - the Sunshine Coast’s longest running adventure showcase - will be held at the Nambour Showgrounds from March 31 to April 2.

Expo Director Bob Carroll said the event would feature more than 1000 of the latest and greatest outdoor adventure products from more than 130 local and national brands.

“The Nambour Expo is all about helping people enjoy great adventures in our beautiful state of Queensland,” Mr Carroll said.

“The Nambour Showgrounds is the perfect location for the Expo and we’re expecting more than 10,000 visitors to attend across the three days.

“This year’s event will feature a massive range of the latest caravans, camper trailers, motorhomes, 4x4 accessories, fishing and camping gear as well as a tonne of terrific information about holiday destinations.

“There will also be daily entertainment with the 4WD Adventure 4x4 Track, Extreme Guru Ray Andrews and Kingbrown Camp Oven Kitchen which has recently ventured into the “Low and Slow” barbeque scene.

“This is shaping up as the biggest caravan and outdoor adventure expo ever held in the region. It’ll be a real one-stop-shop for anyone who loves the great outdoors.”

Division 10 Councillor David Law said the Nambour Expo complemented our region’s healthy, smart and creative lifestyle.

“This is a fantastic event on our calendar and one of many which are iconic to the Nambour Showgrounds,” Cr Law said.

“We recently had another hugely successful Collectorama Fair at the Showgrounds and I’m sure the thousands of patrons who are set to attend the Nambour Expo will have a fantastic experience at a venue which is a jewel in the crown of our region.

“Council recently completed renewal works to the equestrian facilities as well as the access stairs and balustrade in the JD Grimes Grandstand, which look terrific and will also improve the safety and accessibility for visitors to the showgrounds.
