The [Caloundra Indoor Stadium](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Sports-and-Leisure/Sports-Complexes-and-Fields/Caloundra-Indoor-Stadium)
&#x20;is one of the Sunshine Coast’s most popular and versatile venues and it is now even better equipped to cater for sports, events and conferences.  

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said upgrades to showers, amenities and kiosk facilities were complete, enabling greater comfort and service for the thousands of people from across Australia who use the venue each year.

“The Caloundra Indoor Stadium is one of the jewels in our region’s sporting crown. It is the Sunshine Coast’s only four court multipurpose air-conditioned stadium and hosts a wide range of events, from local fixtures to national level tournaments as well as expos, trade shows, conferences and community events,” Cr Landsberg said.

“These upgrades to the stadium’s shower and amenity facilities and the kiosk will enable us to deliver an even better experience to the thousands of participants, competitors and visitors who come here for future events.

“Along with these recently completed upgrades, council is planning for the installation of an accessible lift at Caloundra Indoor Stadium to provide access to the mezzanine floor, which is expected to be completed and ready for use mid-year.”

Upcoming events at the Caloundra Indoor Stadium this year include the Queensland Gymnastics Championships in June, the National Table Tennis Championships in July and the Australian Schools Volleyball Championships in August.
