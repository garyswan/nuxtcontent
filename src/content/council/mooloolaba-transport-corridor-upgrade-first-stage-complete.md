An important milestone was reached today (April 16) with the completion of the $8.5 million upgrade of Walan Street, between Venning Street and Smith Street in Mooloolaba.

The Walan Street upgrade now completes stage one of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade project which will include the widening of Walan Street and Brisbane Road to four traffic lanes, a new Mayes Canal bridge and other intersection and landscape improvements.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade was an important transport project that would improve safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, improve traffic flow, reduce delays during peak periods and cater for future traffic growth.

“We’re preparing now for the anticipated growth in traffic generated by residents, businesses and the attraction of Mooloolaba’s natural features, with daily trips expected to increase from around 61,000 today to more than 90,000 in 2041,” Cr Natoli said.

“The upgrade to Walan Street is an important part of this future planning.

“Motorists will also benefit from better access to the new ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park and the new signalised intersection at Walan Street and Naroo Court.

“Construction of the highly anticipated upgrade of Stages 2 and 3 of Brisbane Road to four traffic lanes will also soon begin.

“It’s wonderful we are now in a position to move onto the Brisbane Road upgrade, which presents an opportunity to enhance the gateway arrival experience into Mooloolaba.

“Thanks to the Federal Government’s $12 million funding contribution, we have brought forward the new Mayes Canal Bridge construction.”

Stages 2 and 3 will now be built concurrently, with construction starting in May 2021 and anticipated for completion in late 2022.

Councillor Natoli said these two stages would see the widening of Brisbane Road from two lanes to four lanes, connecting to Stage 1B Walan Street upgrade.

“Located between Walan Street and Kyamba Court, Stages 2 and 3 will include intersection upgrades, provision for cyclists, landscaping and the new Mayes Canal Bridge,” Cr Natoli said.

“The new bridge will maintain the same waterway clearance as the current bridge and be a 26.4-metre-wide, four lane bridge with shared pedestrian and cycle paths on both sides.

“With Brisbane Road being one of Mooloolaba’s main arteries, we will keep traffic moving while we make this important upgrade.

“Council will continue to make every effort to minimise impacts to the local community and businesses during construction however this is a major construction project and some inconvenience is to be expected.

“Residents and interested parties will be provided with advance notice of anticipated impacts and will be updated as the project progresses.”
