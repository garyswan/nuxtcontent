A friendly reminder to all dog and cat owners on the Sunshine Coast to renew your pet registration, if you haven’t already done so, as registrations are now overdue.

Pet registration renewals were due by September 30 so now is the time to renew your registration to avoid receiving an infringement. 

Discounts apply for desexed pets, with the cost being just $24 and registration is free if you have a current pensioner card and your pet is both desexed and microchipped.

There is also the option of a lifetime registration for desexed and microchipped cats – only $87 with no annual renewal fee required.

Registration is free for pets under six-months-old.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said reminder notices were on their way to the 31 per cent of dog and cat owners who had failed to renew their pet’s registration on time.

“Continued failure to renew your pet’s registration may result in a $287 infringement,” Cr Johnston said.

“Not only does the registration help council to reunite lost pets with their owners and provide funding for pet-related services, it’s also an important part of being a responsible pet owner.

“It’s an offence to have an unregistered dog or cat on the Sunshine Coast for more than 14 days.

“If you haven’t received a renewal notice, your pet’s details have changed or you no longer own your pet, please contact council as soon as possible to update your details and avoid receiving an infringement.”

The annual registration period for cats (excluding lifetime registered cats) and dogs starts on October 1 each year and runs through until September 30 the following year.

There are several convenient payment methods available, including online payments via [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
 or BPay, over the phone or at a council customer contact centre. Where possible, online payment is preferred.

Pet owners can also update their pet’s details, including changes to desexing, microchipping and pensioner details or cancelling your pet’s registration if you no longer own your pet, via [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
 or an [online form](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Cat-and-Dog-Registration/Updating-Registration-Details)
&#x20;on council’s website.
