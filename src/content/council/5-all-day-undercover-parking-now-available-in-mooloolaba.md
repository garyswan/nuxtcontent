Enjoy summer in Mooloolaba and stay all day with a $5 daily parking rate now available at the undercover ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park on the corner of First Avenue and Smith Street.

Built Infrastructure Group Executive Tom Jamieson said world class beaches, the vibrant Wharf precinct esplanade, eateries and entertainment activities were easier to access with the new all day flat rate parking available until the end of May 2022.

“The eight-storey car park has 700 parking spaces, 13 accessible parking spaces, 54 motorcycle and 50 bicycle spaces,” Mr Jamieson said.

“Conveniently located in the centre of Mooloolaba, the multi-deck car park is accessible via Brisbane Road and Smith Street.

“The six-month flat rate is an outcome of the Mooloolaba Visitation Study undertaken by council, in consultation with the Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce, between August and November 2021.

“The pricing change is anticipated to be one of a number of actions planned to be undertaken next year, in conjunction with the Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce.

“Motorists parked for less than an hour will be charged $2.50 and once over the hour, parking is capped at $5 a day.

“Charges for vehicles parked at the temporary Brisbane Road outdoor car park, remain the same: an hourly rate of $2.50, with a maximum daily charge of $12.50.”

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said council remained committed to investing in and supporting Mooloolaba, with recent major infrastructure projects including the new Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation project, upgrades to Brisbane Road and Walan Street, the redeveloped Mooloolaba Holiday Park and the new ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park.

“Providing a convenient flat rate parking option aims to provide a boost to local businesses, re-affirming Mooloolaba as one of the region’s premier destinations,” Cr Natoli said.
