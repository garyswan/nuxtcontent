Development application fees for theatres, bars, nightclubs or hotel use\* in the Nambour Special Entertainment Precinct, have been slashed by 50 percent, to incentivise new business start-ups.

Infrastructure charges for development within targeted Nambour areas have also been cut by half to increase demand and create long-term employment in the area.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said the Material Change of Use fee incentives for the Nambour Special Entertainment Precinct continued to offer financial assistance for local businesses and community groups.

“The precinct is only the second of its kind in Queensland,” Cr Law said.

“It will provide venues with greater certainty about where and how they can operate including the relevant noise levels.

“It has been a tough couple of years for the entertainment industry, and we are committed to continue encouraging and providing assistance to the industry on the Sunshine Coast.”

Cr Law said council’s infill development incentives, which reduce infrastructure charges, had been extended by three years to June 2025 and covered targeted areas in both Nambour and Caloundra.

“The total amount of all infill incentive approvals is limited a maximum of $10 million overall, so individual incentives will be granted on a first in, first served basis,” Cr Law said.

“I encourage potential applicants to contact council to understand the criteria and explore payment options.”
