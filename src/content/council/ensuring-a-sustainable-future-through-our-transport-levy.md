Moving around our region efficiently and sustainably as more people choose to live in our region is essential if we are to maintain the liveability, connectivity and productivity of our region.

Sunshine Coast Council today (10 November) endorsed the 2020/21 Transport Levy Annual Report, which highlights Council’s work towards achieving an effective, integrated transport network.

Community Portfolio Councillor and Deputy Mayor Rick Baberowski said the Transport Levy raised just over $ 6.4 million in 2020/21 which Council invested in research, planning, investigations, service improvements and infrastructure, all to support delivery and strong advocacy in helping residents moving around efficiently and, importantly, continuing to build the Futures Fund.

“We expect more than 500,000 people will live in the Sunshine Coast local government area) in the next 20 years,” Cr Baberowski said.

“An integrated transport network is more important than ever if we want to preserve our lifestyle and assets, maintain our liveability and avoid spending long periods of time in traffic congestion.

“Increasing travel options and reducing reliance on private cars is key to achieving a sustainable transport network.

“While public transport services are the responsibility of the State Government, Council is investing in, and planning for, improved infrastructure to strengthen partnerships and act as a catalyst for improvement and innovation where it can benefit our community.

“Last financial year, a significant portion of the Transport Levy funding – totalling more than $2.8 million – was allocated to the Transport Futures Fund.

“This Transport Levy funding, which would not otherwise be available, helps facilitate projects and initiatives aimed at achieving major long-term outcomes in a multi-modal environment.

“This includes Council’s Travel Behaviour Change Project, which aims to deeply understand existing patterns and potentially increase the motive of Sunshine Coast residents to use their private vehicle less or consider the use of alternative transport options more often.

“The Levy was also used to produce active travel maps that cover the coastal areas from Peregian Springs to Pelican Waters.

“In addition, $630,000 from the Transport Levy was used to upgrade 33 bus stops across the Sunshine Coast LGA last financial year.

“These upgrades contributed to 98 per cent of Council’s bus stops achieving compliance with the *Disability Discrimination Act 1992,* contributing to a more inclusive community.

“We are on track to meet the legislated schedule of full compliance by December 2022.”

The Levy also continued to assist Council to trial transport services such as Flexilink, Council Link and the community-led Kenilworth Community Transport Service.

The Transport Levy funded the Mass Transit Options Analysis work this financial year.
