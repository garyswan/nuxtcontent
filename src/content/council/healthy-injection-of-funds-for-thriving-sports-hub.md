Upgraded recreation facilities and improvements to pedestrian safety are the big winners for Division 3, following the tabling of Sunshine Coast Council’s 2023-24 Budget.

Divisional Councillor Peter Cox said Council’s billion-dollar budget included a varied mix of important projects to create a stronger, better and more sustainable Sunshine Coast.

Division 3 suburbs encompass Aroona, Bokarina, Birtinya, Currimundi, Little Mountain, Meridan Plains, Warana and Wurtulla.

Almost $30 million has been allocated to maintain Division 3’s growing sports and recreation needs.

This year’s big-ticket Budget items for the area include $9.12 million for the Kawana Waters Regional Aquatic Centre; more than $3 million to prepare for the future expansion of Sunshine Coast Stadium and $14.35 million for the evolution of the Honey Farm Road Sports Precinct.

Cr Cox said the stadium expansion would lift the venue’s capacity as it continued to grow in popularity for hosting sport and entertainment events.

“As an emerging sports hub, I’m pleased with Council’s continued investment in Honey Farm Road Sports Precinct which supports an active and healthy lifestyle for Division 3 residents,” Cr Cox said.

“Parks and Gardens in our division will see an investment of more than $700,000, which includes Ridgehaven Park’s dog off-leash area extension, Bokarina Beach Park half basketball court, and the Westaway Parade boat ramp carpark area.”

Minor capital works projects have attracted a substantial investment of $1.25 million for the region.

“This includes $350,000 for Beerburrum St, Aroona’s signalised pedestrian crossing, which addresses the safety concerns of local school students, as well as making Ridgehaven Park more accessible,’’ Cr Cox said

“Around $500,000 has also been allocated for new pathways and replacing existing pathways – an important spend to keep residents connected and safe.”

Council handed down its 2023-24 Budget on June 22.
