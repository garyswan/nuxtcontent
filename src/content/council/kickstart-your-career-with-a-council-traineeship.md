If getting paid to gain valuable skills and work experience while completing a certificate qualification appeals to you, apply now for a Sunshine Coast Council traineeship.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said applications for 2021 traineeships were now open and a diverse range of opportunities within council were available for people of all ages and backgrounds.

“I urge anyone who lives on the Sunshine Coast and has limited qualifications and limited work experience to take this opportunity,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Our trainees are paid to learn on-the-job for 12 months and complete a certificate qualification, so it’s the best of both worlds.”

That was certainly the case for 2019 Sunshine Coast Young Business Woman of the Year award recipient Jade Law, who completed a council traineeship in 2011.

“It’s the best thing I’ve ever done!” she said.

“I took on a business administration traineeship after finishing my final year of high school and by the end of my 12 months I had learned so many new skills through a wide range of roles.

“When my traineeship finished, I was fortunate enough to earn a permanent position within council, complete further study at university with council’s support and I now work in my dream position in council’s People and Culture team.

“I’m so pleased that I took the opportunity to apply for a council traineeship and so grateful for the opportunities at council over the past decade!”

For more information or to apply for a 2021 council traineeship, visit the [job vacancies](https://careers.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;page on council’s website. Applications close on April 2.
