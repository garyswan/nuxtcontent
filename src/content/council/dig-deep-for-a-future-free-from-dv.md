Sunshine Coast residents are encouraged to don their orange outfits and take part in a special tree-planting event in the dunes at Mooloolaba Foreshore Reserve on Tuesday, November 30, to mark 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. 

Sunshine Coast Council is calling on residents to join in an act of solidarity and support for victims of domestic and family violence.

This year’s theme is *Orange the world: End violence against women now!* and everyone is encouraged to proudly wear orange from November 25 to December 10.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was proud to partner with the Sunshine Coast Make It Stop Committee for a second year to deliver the tree-planting event, with council providing another 300 native trees, shrubs and groundcovers.

“We had a great turnout last year with more than 40 people generously donating their time and we would love to see even more Sunshine Coast residents show their support for this significant cause,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Domestic and family violence has no place in our Sunshine Coast community and we have zero tolerance for it.

“Alarmingly, one in three women\* aged 15 years and older around the world have been subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner, non-partner or both, at least once in their lifetime.

“Working together we can have an open and honest conversation and focus our efforts on eliminating this scourge from our society.

“This year the United Nations is encouraging everyone to wear orange during the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, which symbolises a brighter future, one where women and children are free from domestic and family violence, and one that can’t come soon enough.”

Today also marks the one-year anniversary since not-for-profit group Make It Stop launched.

Former Australian tennis player, local resident and Make It Stop Chair Mark Kratzmann said many support services were available for people experiencing domestic and family violence.

“We encourage anyone who may need help to please know you are not alone,” Mr Kratzmann said.

“Make It Stop is keen to continue raising awareness and educating people about the impacts, signs and types of domestic and family violence as well as when to act against it, seek help and provide support.”

Queensland Police Service Superintendent Craig Hawkins is also a member of the Make It Stop committee and said the entire community had a role to play in preventing domestic and family violence as well as supporting survivors of violence.

“Each year on the Sunshine Coast we attend more than 4000 domestic and family violence incidents, and of those cases, approximately half end up in applications or orders to the court,” Supt Hawkins said.

“The work the Make It Stop Committee, council and the community do is an important commitment for everyone to unite and show their zero tolerance to any form of DV in the household.”

The [Queensland Government](https://www.qld.gov.au/community/getting-support-health-social-issue/support-victims-abuse/domestic-family-violence)
 has online resources about recognising domestic and family violence, the support and services available to victims, and advice on how to respectfully and safely help someone that is in a domestic and family violence situation.

Registration to the tree planting event is essential and due to COVID Safe guidelines. Visit <https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/14415856-a/seeds-of-hope-planting-event>


**What:** Seeds of Hope planting event

**When:** Tuesday, November 30 7.30-9am

**Where:** Mooloolaba Foreshore Reserve (Beach Access 185 just down from Mooloolaba Beach Holiday Park off Parkyn Parade)

The tree-planting event is just one of a number of awareness raising activities taking place during the 16 days of activism. Coordinated by local domestic and family violence support services such as [IFYS Ltd](https://www.ifys.com.au/)
 and Human Rights organisation [Zonta Maroochydore](https://www.facebook.com/zontamaroochy/)
, there will be community engagement activities and workplace morning tea events occurring across the Sunshine Coast. As a proud partner, council will be promoting these engagement opportunities on our Facebook page.

In May this year council helped launch the [Red Bench Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Red-benches-provide-a-beacon-reminder-of-domestic-and-family-violence-260521)
&#x20;alongside the Red Rose Foundation, a community campaign in the hope bright red benches installed across the region will raise public awareness and provide an opportunity to remind people of the unacceptable presence of domestic and family violence in communities.

Earlier this year, Council committed to [donating](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Council-iPhones-to-support-and-connect-DV-victims-100221)
&#x20;a total of 100 iPhones to local organisation DV Safe Phone to help domestic and family violence victims in need, 50 were donated in February and the balance of which will be donated next month.
