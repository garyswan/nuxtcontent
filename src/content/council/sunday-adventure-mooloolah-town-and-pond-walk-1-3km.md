Take a relaxing 1.3km stroll or ride through the beautiful township of Mooloolah, past playgrounds and out to the residential ponds.

## Suitability

Suitable for all age groups (although sections of grass only along the pond may prove a bit difficult for prams and small wheels).

## Highlights

Mooloolah township is a beautiful country village with plenty of cafes, eateries and park areas to enjoy on a leisurely outing.

This short walk takes you westward past the playground shaded by impressive Fig trees, towards King Road. A left-hand turn onto the right hand side of the road will take you down a footpath towards the ponds.

You’ll cross the Mooloolah River footbridge, pass the local primary school and see the path leading you into the tranquility of the ponds nestled in the residential area of Brand Place. Beautiful water birds and other wildlife can be seen enjoying the lily pad covered water. Small bridges span the pond so the views can be enjoyed on either side. It’s an ideal location to sit and relax and enjoy nature.

## Afterwards

Head back the way you came and grab a bite to eat in town. The locals are truly welcoming and the service in all the food outlets is superb.

If you have children, they will love spending time in Martin Rungert Park. Besides the generous, fully fenced playground, there are BBQs, toilets and picnic areas to utilise.

## How to get there

Park along Bray Road near the town centre and head west to King Road.
