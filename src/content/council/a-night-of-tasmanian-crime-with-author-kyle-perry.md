Sunshine Coast Council Libraries invites devoted crime readers to enjoy an evening with acclaimed Tasmanian author Kyle Perry at the Maroochy RSL from 6pm on Wednesday 21 July.

This special literary event is part of a Sunshine Coast Libraries author events series hosted at locations across the region. It is the first live author event Libraries has hosted since they were placed on hold due to COVID-19.   

Kyle will talk about his latest fiction release *The Deep,* an atmospheric story set in the rugged landscape of Tasmania, where the author once again draws on his years as a drug and alcohol counsellor to present a novel full of raw and gritty characters.

*The Deep* focusses on a fictional family who have been affected by the drug trade in their hometown, for which they are responsible.

It’s a powerful novel from one of the brightest young voices on the Australian crime fiction scene, showcasing the best and worst of human nature and how far people will go in the name of pride, honour, family and redemption.

Kyle’s debut *The Bluffs,* was shortlisted for the Dymocks Book of the Year, Indie Debut of the Year and longlisted for the ABIA General Fiction of the Year.

Tasmanian crime fiction writers are on the rise, with readers attracted to the lush yet eerie landscape set in the Apple Isle.

Other Tasmanian authors include Heather Bruny, Julia Leigh, Marcus Clark, David Owen, Stephen Brown, Barry Weston, and Rohan Wilson who have gone on to literary and global success.

Kyle’s books will be available for purchase at the venue and there will be a book signing session.

Tickets are $25 per person and bookings are essential via council’s library website: [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Kyle-Perry)


Kyle will be joined by special guest, former ABC Sunshine Coast announcer, Mary-Lou Stephens.

Light refreshments and a cash wine bar is available from 6-7pm, the event will begin at 7pm.

Enjoy live music by talented local artist Lauren Hutton.

Maroochy RSL is located at 105 Memorial Ave, Maroochydore 4558.
