Walkers and runners will soon be able to pound the pavement along Parkyn Parade, Mooloolaba as works get underway on a new pathway and two new pedestrian crossings.

Next week, works will begin on replacing the old path with a new 2-metres-wide pathway extending from The Wharf Mooloolaba carpark, on the south side of Parkyn Parade, to the roundabout at Urunga Esplanade.

Stage 1 Works – Location of pedestrian crossings (in red) and pathway renewals (in blue) along Parkyn Parade. Works to be completed prior to March 11.

The second section of pathway will extend from Mooloolaba Beach Holiday Park entrance to the parks’ southern boundary.

Council will also be installing two pedestrian crossings, one located near Penny Lane and the second at The Wharf car park entrance to ensure safety for our locals and visitors crossing to the popular precinct.

Works have been scheduled to coordinate with [The Wharf car park stage 2 works](https://oursc.com.au/featured/what-you-need-to-know-the-wharf-mooloolaba-construction)
&#x20;which are also being undertaken by council. Both lots of work will pause for the Mooloolaba Triathlon on March 11-13.

Stage 2 Works – Location of pedestrian crossings (in red) and pathway renewals (in blue) along Parkyn Parade. Works to be completed prior to Easter school Holidays.

While there will be some temporary limited parking available, the combined works minimise the impacts and period of disruption to businesses and the community in the long run.
