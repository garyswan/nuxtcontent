Sunshine Coast residents have been given an extra week to pay their rate bill as the local council moves to help residents affected by the recent Queensland COVID lockdown.

Sunshine Coast Council Finance Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said residents now had until 27 August to pay their rate bills without incurring interest.

“The Sunshine Coast local government area is one of 11 areas across south east Queensland which was placed into lockdown 31 July to 8 August,” Cr Hungerford said.

“It is important that council once again does everything it can to help our residents during what is a difficult time.

“Council is very aware of the strain hard lockdowns, like the one we recently experienced, place on communities and especially on people who run businesses or whose employment is affected.

“By providing additional time for ratepayers to either set up a payment arrangement or pay their rates in full before interest applies, we’re supporting residents when they need it most.”

Ratepayers who cannot make their rate bill payment by the extended date of 27 August are encouraged to apply to enter into an interest-free payment arrangement.

To set up a payment arrangement to pay your rates by fortnightly or monthly instalments residents can log into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, contact council by phone 07 5475 7272, or email rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au before 27 August.

Ratepayers will also have an additional week to put themselves in the running to win up to $1000 off their next rate bill by signing up to receive future rate notices by email. Simply register for a [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account or login to an existing account, change your rate notice delivery method to email before 25 August and you’ll be in the running.

There is a range of convenient online payment options available to pay your rate bill, including BPAY and by phone on 131 816. Check your rate notice to see all the ways you can pay. 

To assist with online or over-the-phone payments, property owners will need their payment reference number, found on their rate notice.

For rates enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
