The trees are up, the banners are in, the lights are on—let the countdown to Christmas begin.

Sunshine Coast Council has installed more than 350 festive banners, decorated 24 trees and hung an array of festive decorations right across the region.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said in keeping with the community’s wishes expressed during a festive program review, and endorsed by council in March, this year council had focussed on supporting our community to hold their own events.

“Our new festive banners feature two new designs chosen by our community,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“One is a delightful natural design, celebrating our native flora and the other is a contemporary nod to Christmas.

“We also created a new festive community grants category to support local, community-organised Christmas, New Year and Australia Day events.

“The uptake of that grant has been widespread, with Eumundi, Buderim, Montville, Mooloolah Valley, Yandina, Alexandra Headland and Beerwah all hosting their own events.”

Council’s Christmas lights experience, ‘The Festive Garden’ at the Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden has sold out with the free, walk-through experience providing a wonderful way for families, friends and loved ones to get into the Christmas spirit. Details about all Sunshine Coast Council events and community group events, can be found on council’s events website [events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;including links to the latest Covid-19 public health directions as they apply to festivals and events.
