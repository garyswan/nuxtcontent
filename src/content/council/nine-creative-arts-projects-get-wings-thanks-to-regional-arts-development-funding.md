Nine Sunshine Coast creative practitioners have been awarded a share in more than $54,000 Regional Arts Development Funding (RADF).

IN | artist run initiative - founded by June Sartracom, Ruby Donohoe and Sharna Barker – received $8200 in RADF funding to run its 2022 IN | SIGHT Professional Development Workshop Series at The Old Lock Up in Maroochydore.

Ruby Donohoe said the practice-led workshops would be delivered by some of Queensland's leading arts professionals. 

“This professional development series is for emerging and established contemporary artists from a range of disciplines and will be based on Kabi Kabi / Gubbi Gubbi Country,” Ms Donohoe said. 

RADF funding will go towards artist fees and workshop related expenses.

Another successful recipient was renowned artist Alicia Melonie Jones who is teaming up with Sunshine Coast emerging artists Rose Lawson-Lamond and Tara Heard to create a site-informed performance work, ‘Finding the Satryicon’.

Funding of $5000 will assist the concept development of this performance project which blends advances in neuroscience with human mythology in an inspirational tale of human determination, fate and love.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the Regional Arts Development Fund was an excellent long-standing partnership between the Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council, which had over the years supported many hundreds of arts development projects in our region. 

“RADF funds are particularly aimed at providing pivotal support for the development of our artists, creative practitioners and producers,” Cr Baberowski said. 

“Those projects need to align with our region’s 20-year Arts Plan, which places the professional development of artists and their practice at its core.

“I find it particularly encouraging that these two projects are pitching themselves as a counter to where possibly dangerous or decadent deeds can lead. In fact, this latest round of applications shows an exciting and maturing mix of cultural development, theatre and interdisciplinary arts practice, which further builds creative capacity in our region.”

There are three RADF funding rounds per year with closing dates of 1 March, 1 July and 1 November.

There are five funding categories:

*   Individual Development - $750 within Australia and $1500 international
*   Mentorship - Up to $5000
*   Concept Development - Up to $5000
*   Project - Up to $10,000
*   Seed - up to $10,000 first year, up to $5000 second year and up to $2500 third year

Anyone interested in applying for RADF funding can access one-on-one consultations with council’s Creative Development Officers.

Forty-five-minute consults will be offered online via Zoom or by phone on  January 24 and February 3 and 9. An online information session for First Nations artists and creatives will be offered Monday,  February 7 at 11am facilitated by council’s Creative Development Officer (First Nations).
