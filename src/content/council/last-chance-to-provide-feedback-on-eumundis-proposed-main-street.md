What do you think of Eumundi's proposed new thoroughfare?

Since November 2020, Sunshine Coast Council has been listening to, and speaking with Eumundi locals, businesses and community groups to develop a draft streetscape design for Memorial Drive.

The initial and follow up feedback informed the Design and Placemaking team of the community’s priorities which included:

◾ A desire for an improved pedestrian experience.

◾ Artistic lighting features.

◾ Enhancement of memorial fig trees.

◾ Pedestrian linkages from Memorial Drive to Napier Road to improve access to existing car-parking areas.
