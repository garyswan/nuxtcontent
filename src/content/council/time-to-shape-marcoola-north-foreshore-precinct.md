Sunshine Coast Council is calling for the community to provide feedback and inspire a new streetscape and park for Marcoola North Foreshore.  

Your feedback will help inform the master plan, which will guide future projects including upgrades to the foreshore’s Felix Parry Park and streetscape improvements between the Marcoola Surf Life Saving Club and Lorraine Avenue shops.

The project team will be at the Marcoola farmers markets on January 15, 2022 - so if you're heading for a bite to eat and a browse please leave your feedback with the team.

Visit council’s [website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mnfp)
 to fill out the survey online before Monday, 17 January, 2022
