### Details

The precious fragments of the rainforests of Jinibara Country in Maleny (such as Mary Cairncross) are facing many threats.

You may have noticed dying Bunya trees across the Sunshine Coast hinterland and beyond. Diseases such as 'Dieback' from fungal species Phytophthora sp. and Phellinus noxius are impacting these trees and others.

Another fungal threat Myrtle Rust has only been present in our region for 12 years and is having major impacts on some Myrtaceae species. Learn more about these threats, and how we can help prevent disease spread and assist with the survival of our amazing biodiversity and culturally significant ecology.

Spencer Shaw (Brush Turkey Enterprises) and BJ Murphy (Munimba-ja, Gallery and Cultural Space) share their recent research into Bunya Dieback and discuss the implications and management challenges, both environmentally and culturally in our local landscape.
