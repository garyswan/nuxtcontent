A trial of affordable and environmentally friendly transport will explore whether electric scooters and bikes can make life on the Sunshine Coast even better.

Initially, Expressions of Interest (EOI) for an e-scooter and e-bike operator trial in the Maroochydore and Mooloolaba area were open between December 12, 2022 and February 3, 2023.

Following community feedback, council has now extended the EOI application process to Tuesday, March 7.

Sunshine Coast Council Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the extension would help to ensure we gather interest from a broad spectrum of e-scooter and e-bike hire operators.

“Based on feedback from potential operators who are keen to consider offering their services to our region, we have extended the period as we better appreciate the busy festive season was a challenging time frame to complete the Expressions of Interest,” Cr Baberowski explained.

“This trial, which is proposed to start mid-year, will be an opportunity for council, residents and visitors to experience and test e-scooter and e-bike hire services within specific controls and locations on the Coast. The subsequent aim is to encourage more people to spend more time actively enjoying our pathways and outdoor spaces.

“This is an important pilot project and it’s important that all e-scooter and e-bike hire operators be given ample opportunity to submit an EOI to council.

“Council is committed to finding the right service provider with the right equipment and experience to provide a safe, eco-friendly alternative to getting around our region, while helping to ease traffic congestion,” Cr Baberowski said.
