Amid scones and laughter, a new era dawned at the [Bankfoot House Precinct](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Bankfoot-House/Bankfoot-House-Heritage-Precinct)
 today with the unveiling of a new patio at the Mary Grigor Interpretive Centre, new pathways and a retro paint job for the old house.

The day kicked off with one of Bankfoot’s much loved events, [Sconetime](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Scone-Time)
, where more than 100 guests celebrated with conversation and scones—Bankfoot style.

The weekend of celebration continues with a [watercolour talk and workshop](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Fridays)
, plus live theatre by The Drama Merchant who will present the [Yarn Spinner](http://https//heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Yarn-Spinner)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the addition of the patio would allow council to hold more all-weather events at this exceptional heritage precinct.

“Bankfoot is becoming known for its regularly sold out heritage inspired events and the addition of the undercover patio makes such good sense in our climate,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Visitor numbers have increased nicely over the years, especially with group and school bookings, so formalised pathways, including benches to sit and enjoy the property and its stunning view of the 28million year old Glasshouse Mountains, will help provide a more relaxed and accessible experience for all.

“The tremendously worn and iconic old wagon will also be better able to continue withstanding the ravages of time and weather for a fair bit longer with an improved shelter to ensure the items left in our care are looked after in the best possible way.”

The project, which included seeking the advice of heritage experts before repainting the exterior of the heritage listed Bankfoot House to take it back to its 1950s colour scheme, was funded by the Heritage Levy.

The Levy, charged to every rateable property, is  used to document, research, conserve, protect, promote and provide access to those tangible and intangible items, places, facilities and events that define the stories, history and values of the people, communities and culture of the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council Coordinator Cultural Heritage Services Peter Connell said the works undertaken in the Bankfoot Precinct were about sharing the story of a special place more broadly.

“The project follows hot on the heels of the completion of our [award-winning First Nations VR experience](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Virtual-Bankfoot-wins-national-museum-award)
,” Mr Connell said

“This VR experience is an integral component in telling the story of the Glass House Mountains region and how Bankfoot House fits into the narrative.

“It combines moving image, sound and interactive design transporting the viewer through time – an experience not to be missed by visitors to the precinct.”.

You’ll find Bankfoot House at 1998 Old Gympie Road, Glass House Mountains. The precinct is free to visit and is open Wednesday to Sunday 10am–3pm. Tours of the house start at the Mary Grigor Centre. Virtual tours are also available at [heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Bankfoot-House/Bankfoot-House-Virtual-Tours)
