Infrastructure upgrades, new pathways and trails plus outdoor spaces for all ages are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 9. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said this was her third budget as the community representative for Division 9. “I’m pleased with the spread of projects across the suburbs,” Cr Suarez said.\
“In Bli Bli, $349,000 will complete the sealing of Oyster Bank Road, which is currently a gravel road and will result in less dust for nearby residents and visitors.\
“I’m also very excited to be able to contribute $59,000 to complete the Cenotaph project in Parklakes from the minor capital works fund, the remainder funded by the Department of Veteran Affairs through the Maroochy RSL sub-branch.

“This fantastic local project will bring together our old and new Bli Bli communities as we honour our service women, men and animals.\
“Coolum locals and visitors can make use the new $350,000 amenities block planned for Jack Morgan Park and practise their ball skills on a new half-court basketball court in Lions-Norrie Job Park.\
“Lovers of our coastal pathway will be pleased that design will start on a 232 metre missing link along David Low Way, Coolum Beach, and it should be easier to exit the Coolum Sports Complex with an upgrade to the intersection onto David Low Way.\
“Toddler energy will have another outlet with a new extension to the playground at Peregian Breeze.\
“Whether walking or riding, plans are progressing for a new pathway along Emu Mountain Road, between Old Emu Road and David Low Way, to make the trip between Peregian Breeze and the beach safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\
“Verrierdale residents will have another reason to get active outdoors with $435,000 to progress the walking trails and other items at the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve.\
“The foreshore trail around Lake Weyba, at Weyba Downs will benefit from a $650,000 investment to deliver a new footbridge and a more durable and sustainable track at the popular bird-spotting area plus an upgrade to the north-west carpark.\
“The continued staged upgrade to sealed roads on North Arm Yandina Creek Road, at Yandina Creek, and Lakewood Drive, Peregian Beach, will make the trip a lot more pleasant for regular road users.\
“And for our whole region, around $48 million will be invested in the next financial year to upgrade the Nambour waste precinct at Bli Bli to sustainably manage our region’s future waste and take another step towards our goal to become a zero-net emissions organisation by 2041. “Work will continue on a new state-of-the-art Materials Recovery Facility, a new Resource Recovery Centre and landfill improvements for a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future.\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
