Sunshine Coast Council has been working hard to combat mosquitoes across the region, particularly with recent rainfall events, combined with warmer temperatures and increased humidity.

Residents can play a vital role in reducing mosquito numbers by minimising breeding areas around their homes.

Tips to protect from mosquitoes:

• Use a recommended personal mosquito repellent. Always read the label and follow safety directions

• Wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers. Light colours are best

• Limit time outside at dusk and dawn

• Remove water sources around the house. Tip out containers, pot plants or items holding water. Small amounts of water can breed large numbers of mosquitoes!

• Spray screens with residual products. Always read the label and follow safety directions

• Increase light and air movement around dark and damp areas

• Outdoor areas around your house can be treated with products containing a residual insecticide for control over longer periods

• Change water in pet bowls and bird baths frequently. Clean your roof gutters on a regular basis

• Ensure your rainwater tank is fitted with mosquito proof screens

• Keep swimming pools clean and chlorinated

• Keep any ornamental ponds and fountains stocked with fish

• See a vet for advice on suitable preventative treatments / repellents if your pets are affected.

The Maroochy River catchment has been found to be breeding salt marsh mosquitoes and was treated via helicopter on March 4.
