Meet the students teaching us why we must protect our previous environment.

Almost 250 children, from 20 schools across the region, spent the year researching and developing workshops, interactive displays, short films and community calls to action as part of the 2022 Kids in Action program.

The Kids In Action program is an environmental education initiative underpinned by a kids-teaching-kids approach to teaching. This program partners schools with local environmental stewards and engages students actively in learning about local environmental issues.

Students recently gathered to share with each other their ‘Catchment Connections: Mountains to the Sea’ project presentations at the Kids Teaching Kids Conference on Friday 9 September. The thought-provoking and inspiring projects delivered by schools covered everything from protecting shorebirds and their habitats, to First Nations history and significance of the Obi Obi Creek.

Schools will now be invited to share their conference projects and presentations with the broader community through a special roadshow.

Thanks to our Gold Sponsors, Mirvac Kawana Shoppingworld, the Kids in Action school projects will be on display at Kawana Shoppingworld from November 10 to 13.

Students shared their learnings in workshops, interactive displays, short films and community calls to action as part of the 2022 Kids in Action program.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was delighted to be part of the recent conference and witness the talent, creativity and devotion to creating a more sustainable future for the region.

“Everyone braved the weather to celebrate 10 years of Kids in Action and create a magical day of connection – to both the environment and to each other,” Cr Law said.

“Schools came together to share with each other their ‘Catchment Connections: Mountains to the Sea’ project presentations they have been working on since the Environmental Projects Day in early May.’’

Students and staff from across the Sunshine Coast come together for the 2022 Kids in Actions Kids Teaching Kids Conference.

Sustainability and Liveability Portfolio Cr Maria Suarez said that, in its tenth year, the Kids in Action program was only getting better with age.

“This year’s theme ‘Catchment Connections: Mountains to the Sea’ is pretty special because it entwines all the topics from the program over the past 10 years,” Cr Suarez said.

“I hope everyone had a great time exploring this year’s theme and connecting with the movement pathways and journeys that flow across the landscape catchments of Kabi Kabi and Jinibara Country.

“I would like to thank all the students, teachers, partners and volunteers who continue to make the program possible year after year.”
