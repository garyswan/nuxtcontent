Sunshine Coast rate notices have been issued and will start arriving in your post or inbox this week (week commencing January 24).

Ratepayers once again have the chance to win up to $1000 off their next rate bill by signing up to receive future rate notices by email. All you have to do is register for a [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account or login to an existing account, change your rate notice delivery method to email before Wednesday, February 23 and you’ll be in the running.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said receiving rate notices by email rather than traditional post was more environmentally friendly and registering for a MyCouncil account enabled residents to access a range of convenient online options.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or  logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change  to email,” Cr Hungerford said.

“If you do this before Wednesday, February 23 you’ll automatically go in the running to receive up to $1000 off your next rate bill. If you already receive your rate notices by email, you’re already in the draw.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
. There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;to show you how to change your rate delivery method from traditional post to email.

There is a range of convenient online payment options available, including BPAY and by phone on 131 816. Check your rate notice to see all the ways you can pay.

Council also has a direct debit option, which can be set up to pay rates in full by the due date, to make life easier for busy ratepayers.

To assist with online or over-the-phone payments, property owners will need their payment reference number, found on their rate notice.

Ratepayers who cannot make payment by the due date (February 25) are encouraged to enter into a payment arrangement by logging into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or by contacting council before February 25.

You can also [set up a payment arrangement on line, via councils website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Rates/Pay-by-instalments?utm_source=corporate&utm_medium=spotlights&utm_campaign=Rates)
.\
For rates enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
