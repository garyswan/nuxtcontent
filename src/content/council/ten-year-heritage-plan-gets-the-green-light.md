Sunshine Coast Council today (25 February) endorsed a 10-year heritage plan to protect and engage our residents and visitors in the region’s cultural heritage.

The new plan builds on the success of the inaugural 2015-2020 Heritage Plan covering areas of knowledge, conservation, support, communication and advocacy.

Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said understanding our cultural heritage was extremely important to our identity as a regional community and the new plan would ensure our community keeps a close connection with our past as we forge a bright future.

“As we share stories, we gain a better understanding and appreciation of our region’s history and how we fit into that framework,” Cr Baberowski said.

“I’m confident that this plan reflects our desire to protect, manage and grow our unique regional culture and identity.

“I’d like to thank all those who took the time to provide their expertise and feedback throughout the development of the plan.”

“In November last year, we invited our community to have their say on the draft plan and they did—we received more than 600 responses.

“More than 90 per cent of  respondents rated cultural heritage as very important or important and this, together with detailed feedback on individual strategies helped shape the final plan.

The Sunshine Coast Heritage Plan will now inform the development of the annual Heritage Levy Program, funded by the Heritage Levy.

The new Plan and the Heritage Levy can be found on council’s website [heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About/Heritage-Levy](http://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About/Heritage-Levy)
