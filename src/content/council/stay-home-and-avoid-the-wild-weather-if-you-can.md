Damaging winds, and intense rainfall of up to 300mm are predicted to hit the Sunshine Coast region over the next 24 hours.

There is also the possibility of flooding and severe storms which will further impact the region.

As at 8am all roads into Kenilworth were closed and the area is isolated.

All river catchments, including Maroochy and Mooloolah rivers are likely to have minor to moderate flooding, including at Picnic Point, Maroochydore.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson said with the ground already soaked and a significant amount of rainfall, our river networks will be at full capacity and dangerous.

There is also a risk shallow rooted trees may fall due to the heavy winds expected across the region.

“So I ask everyone to please be vigilant and stay off the roads whenever possible,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“With waterways already swollen, authorities predict more rain will significantly impact areas across the Coast, causing flash flooding.

“I would also ask for the community to stay away from water courses as fast-moving waters can be incredibly treacherous.

“Please stay vigilant and tune into warnings and advice from emergency services and authorities, plus the local emergency broadcaster ABC.

“Remember, if it’s flooded, forget it.”

The Sunshine Coast Airport is operating, however if you are planning to travel by air today from the Sunshine Coast Airport, or pick up guests, check with your airline for the latest information on any delays or cancellations.

A number of Sunshine Coast beaches are closed. Please check Surf Life Saving Queensland’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lifesavingqld/?__cft__[0]=AZXuQ32DKa227nh-rJlldLkJldoM1ZpbTAM2snuZPvAbiR1J2SU0VKj92OtxsC-8XuIOHWizp7afunapjIKxaiuzp1lkMpGKUR0AbuLV5qGiahmATHKO3OLBM_HPsDB9hsA0zCQBcUNxZSwVunbL-wFh&__tn__=kK-R)
&#x20;for information and updates.

The Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve Rainforest Discovery Centre and Scenic Reserve at Maleny are closed today.

Mayor Jamieson urged the community to be prepared, monitor Council’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/#!/SunshineCoastCouncil)
&#x20;and [Disaster Hub](http://disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, and have an emergency plan in place in case it is needed.

Don’t forget to check on your neighbours and remember pets need to be safe during severe weather events as well.
