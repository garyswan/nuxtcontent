Switching their rates notice delivery method from traditional post to email has paid off for a Pelican Waters couple who are the latest winners of Sunshine Coast Council’s ‘Win Your Rates’ competition. 

Marcel and Priscilla will have $1000 taken off their mid-year rates bill after winning the competition, which ran from January 23 to February 23. 

“We made the change to receiving our rates notices by email instead of by post in January,” Marcel said.

“Like so many people on the Sunshine Coast, we care about our environment and doing our bit to reduce paper output was an easy choice for us and the chance to win $1000 off our rates bill was also a great incentive!

“Changing our rates notice delivery method on MyCouncil was nice and easy and receiving our rates by email also made online payment convenient.

“We’re thrilled to win $1000 off our next rates bill and we plan to spend it on a family trip to the Whitsunday Islands.”

Sunshine Coast Council Finance Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said receiving rates notices by email rather than traditional post was more environmentally friendly and registering for a MyCouncil account enabled residents to access a range of convenient online options.

“Marcel and Priscilla are among approximately 39,000 property owners who’ve made the change to receiving their rate notices electronically,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Council is always looking for ways to operate in a more environmentally friendly way and help create a healthy, smart and creative lifestyle here on the Sunshine Coast.

“Moving to an online system also enables ratepayers to receive their rate notices wherever they are, anywhere in the world and arrange payment in a convenient and timely manner.

“I encourage all ratepayers who are still receiving their notices in the post to visit council’s website, sign up to [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or login to their existing MyCouncil account and change your preferred rates notice delivery method from post to email.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or  logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change to email.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account and changing your preferred rates notice delivery method on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
