Come along to Sunshine Coast Council’s free beach clean-up and dune planting event, which was rescheduled when severe weather impacted our Plastic Free July celebrations.

The community event, which will also offer a chance to learn more about what we can do to protect our precious environment, will be held at North Shore beach, Twin Waters, on Sunday, October 9, from 8-11am. Attendees are asked to gather at the carpark located at the end of North Shore Road, Twin Waters.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez encouraged residents to register now for the *Go Plastic Free and Plant a Tree* event.

“Our region’s beautiful beaches are home to a diverse range of wildlife including the migrating shorebirds which will be returning in October,” Cr Suarez said.

“This event is a great chance to ensure our coastal ecosystems stay plastic free for them.

“There will be an opportunity for attendees to help sort the debris and learn more about reducing waste and the Australian Marine Debris Initiative database.

“Come and lend a hand and plant a tree to help this unique environment.

“Make it a day at the beach and learn about our coast by exploring the Coastal Discovery Van and other exciting displays including council’s responsible pet ownership team.”

Attendees are encouraged to bring a hat, sun safe clothes and enclosed footwear.

This is a plastic-free event (especially single use plastics) so please bring reusable items wherever possible (eg. water bottle and gloves)

Reusable gloves and clean up bags will be available for use on the day.
