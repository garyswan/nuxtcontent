Sunshine Coast Youth Council has launched a short survey designed to tap into the minds of young people.

Sunshine Coast residents aged 12-24 can complete the Youth Council’s survey for their chance to win one of five, $50 vouchers.

The Youth Council is made up of 15 enthusiastic young leaders from across the Sunshine Coast and was formed in 2021 as a part of Sunshine Coast Council’s ongoing commitment to engage and empower young people.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said young people were an important part of our community and represented the future of the Sunshine Coast.

“We want people to thrive here on the Sunshine Coast and are keen to find out what young people love, what could be improved and their ideas for the future,” Cr Law said.

“With the information collected from the survey, the Youth Council will have a clearer picture as to how they can advocate and take action to make a positive difference for young people.

“More than 44,000 young people aged 12-24 years call the Sunshine Coast home and I encourage them to take this chance to be heard.”

Sunshine Coast Council has successfully supported and worked alongside the region’s young people for many years including Youth Week activities, supporting the Youth network, Youth Action Groups, Speak Up Engage, and targeted conversations and consultations.

The Youth Council is one of the many ways Sunshine Coast Council continues to support and collaborate with young people in our region.

The Youth Council Survey is open now and closes Wednesday, May 11.
