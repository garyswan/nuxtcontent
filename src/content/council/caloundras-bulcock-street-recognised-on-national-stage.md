Australia’s first smart city streetscape in Caloundra, has won a National award for its innovation at the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) 2021 National Awards last week (Thursday, October 14, 2021).  

Caloundra Main Street Urban Revitalisation project was awarded the *Landscape Architecture Award* in the *Urban Design* category for exhibiting rare and valued qualities of progressiveness, innovation and creativity.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the urban streetscape project transformed a regional main street into a vibrant, smart and liveable community space.

“What a fantastic outcome and a huge credit to the community and all council teams involved to have our ‘City of Beaches’ a winner on the national stage,” Cr Landsberg said.  

“The jury said as Australia’s ‘first smart city urban streetscape demonstration and testing facility’ the project deserves considerable acknowledgement, but for a project to remain playful while staying true to place is what makes this project truly successful.

“The jury went on to say the design created a vibrant, green and community focused, place that demonstrated a strong focus of design development.

“Council’s Design and Placemaking Services designed and delivered the four-stage project valued at over $12 million which re-energised the precinct using smart technology, catenary lighting, public art installations and opening up the main street to be more pedestrian friendly.

“This was a truly collaborative process to develop great quality design for Caloundra, with special thanks to Project Delivery, Smart Cities and Economic Development staff who all played key roles. I’m pleased to see council’s Placemaking and Design team listened to the community’s feedback around the project and addressed concerns.

“This multi-faceted project provided a great opportunity to use the main street as a ‘living-lab’ to ground-truth new thinking around Smart City Technology which in turn became a trial for the Maroochydore CBD, plus creative art outcomes that enliven the experience.  

“Congratulations to the many people involved to turn a community vision into a welcoming, innovative and economically rewarding precinct – a place we are proud of.”

The AILA Awards recognised 47 projects across 17 different categories. The winners were recognised for displaying an effort to facilitate environmental stewardship while striving for cultural sustainability, particularly in the Gardens, Health and Education Landscape, Parks and Play Spaces categories.

AILA President Claire Martin said the past 18 months had highlighted the strengths and vulnerabilities of our cities, stressing the need for our public spaces to deliver fundamental social, environmental, and economic change.

“This year’s diverse award entrants demonstrate the leading role that landscape architects play in delivering innovative responses to complex issues and making positive contributions to our regions and cities,” Ms Martin said.

“Despite all the challenges the pandemic delivered, it presents a great opportunity for the industry to re-evaluate how we use these spaces.

“The variety of submissions illustrates the passion and drive of our AILA members to influence the way we work, live and play.”
