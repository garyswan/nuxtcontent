Congratulations to the 2022 Year 4 students at Good Samaritan Catholic College, Bli Bli, on this amazing performance which was the culmination of their marine turtle conservation learning unit.

The teacher advised that it was a learning area of HASS.

The class started off by interpreting data (from the Sunshine Coast Council) about what parts of the Sunshine Coast (and the world) light pollution impacts.

They looked at the interconnection between people and the environment and what impact people have on the environment and proposed actions people could take in response to an issue or challenge (light pollution).

They also created brochures about light pollution that were displayed at school and at Sea Life to educate people about this issue that isnâ€™t as well-known as other forms of pollution (e.g. marine debris etc.).

The talented teacher wrote the lyrics to the song and another student recorded the backing track.

The students learnt the song and dance to perform to Sea Life staff on their excursion where they visited the Turtle Rehabilitation Centre.
