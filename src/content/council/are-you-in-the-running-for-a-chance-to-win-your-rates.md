Time is running out to give yourself a chance to win up to $1000 off your next rate bill.

All you need to do is sign up to receive your future rate notices by email through [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;before February 23.

Sunshine Coast Council Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said receiving rate notices by email rather than traditional post was more environmentally friendly and registering for a MyCouncil account enabled residents to access a range of convenient online options.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or  logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change to email,” Cr Hungerford said.

“If you do this before next Wednesday (February 23) you’ll put yourself in the running to receive up to $1000 off your next rate bill. If you already receive your rate notices by email, you’re already in the draw.

“Those property owners who receive their rate notices by email also have the option of setting a calendar reminder to pay their rates. You can also manage pet registrations and make requests to council all through MyCouncil.”

Property owners can find a step-by-step guide to setting up their [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account and changing their preferred rate notice delivery method on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
. There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;to show how to change your rate delivery method from traditional post to email.

There is a range of convenient online payment options available to pay your rates, including BPAY and by phone on 131 816. Check your rate notice to see all the ways you can pay.

Council also has a direct debit option, which can be set-up to pay rates in full by the due date, to make life easier for busy property owners.

To assist with online or over-the-phone payments, property owners will need their payment reference number, found on their rate notice.

People who cannot make payment by the due date (February 25) are encouraged to enter into a payment arrangement by logging into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or by contacting council before February 25.

You can also [set up a payment arrangement on line, via councils website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Rates/Pay-by-instalments?utm_source=corporate&utm_medium=spotlights&utm_campaign=Rates)
.

For rate enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
