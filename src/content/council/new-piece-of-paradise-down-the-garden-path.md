If you’re looking for a tranquil walk or a stunning spot to soak up the sunshine, add Pacific Paradise’s Eliza Peatling Park to your must visit list.

This hidden gem has benefited from a makeover, with recently finished Sunshine Coast Council works creating a beautiful space for residents and visitors to enjoy.

Wander down the new deco granite pathways while admiring the leafy gardens and large lawn space that’s perfect for a picnic or to play.

The layout of the landscape centres on what will grow to be a magnificent feature tree.  

When you’re ready to relax, take a seat on the new furniture and admire the peaceful surrounds.

The existing playground will keep the kids busy and there’s a barbecue to cook some snags on for lunch.

The park includes public toilets and is dog friendly (but remember to keep your pooch on a leash and be considerate of other park users).

The Eliza Peatling Park is located off Gayome St in Pacific Paradise.
