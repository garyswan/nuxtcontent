Works to improve traffic flow and safety at the Maroochy Boulevard and Dalton Drive intersection in Maroochydore will start this month.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the intersection upgrade would cater for the traffic growth occurring now and forecast to climb from 35,500 to 40,000 vehicles per weekday over the next 10 years.

“Council is taking proactive steps to improve traffic flow and safety for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians as well as plan for Maroochydore’s future as the new CBD comes to life,” Cr Natoli said.

“It will mean some traffic movements will change as a result of this much needed capacity and safety upgrade.

“The intersection will be reconfigured to include two right turn lanes from Maroochy Boulevard into Dalton Drive and two left turn lanes from Dalton Drive into Maroochy Boulevard, easing congestion during peak times.

“The upgrade will also retain the on-road cycle lanes and include new pedestrian crossings to improve connectivity.

“Access to businesses adjacent to the intersection will change to a left turn in, left turn out only arrangement from Dalton Drive to the driveways behind the Maroochydore Homemaker Centre, Lexus of Maroochydore, the Kon-Tiki Building and Mercedes-Benz.

“These changes are critical to improve safety by reducing traffic queuing when entering Dalton Drive from Maroochy Boulevard, and to stop vehicles weaving and turning across multiple lanes of traffic in very close proximity to a very busy intersection.

“U-Turn facilities will be available on Sunshine Cove Way and Dalton Drive to allow vehicles to easily change direction as required.”

Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said that works will be undertaken at night, to help minimise disruption to the community.

“Construction will take place primarily on weeknights between 6pm and 6am,” Cr O’Pray said.

“The project will include extending the two left turn lanes along Maroochy Boulevard onto the Sunshine Motorway entry ramp. On-road cycle lanes will also be improved, and a new signalised cycle crossing will be introduced at the Sunshine Motorway entry ramp.”

The Sunshine Motorway entry ramp upgrades are funded by the Department of Transport and Main Roads and will be delivered by Sunshine Coast Council.

Construction will run from September to November 2021, weather and site conditions permitting. The works will continue through the September and October Queensland school holidays to ensure the project is completed as quickly as possible.
