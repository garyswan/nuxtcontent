Fancy some freebies for your furry friends? Come along to a family friendly event at Buderim Village Park on Saturday 18 September from 9am and learn about a community-designed plan outlining how we can live harmoniously with pets.

Sunshine Coast Council will officially launch a 10-year plan aimed at guiding and supporting pet owners.

The Management Plan for Domestic Animals (Cats and Dogs) 2021 - 2030 was prepared with input from pet owners and non-pet owners and takes a holistic approach to support the connection between people, pets and places on the Sunshine Coast.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said the new plan addressed all aspects of responsible pet ownership including community safety, picking up after pets, abiding by restraint rules and controlling barking.

“We understand that people have different connections and experiences with pets,” Cr Dickson said.

“Some prefer to enjoy places that are pet free, others may not have a pet but enjoy being around them, and others feel their pet is more like a member of the family.

“With a wide range of views across our region, and with the feedback we received, we developed the plan to guide and support pet owners to contribute to safe, strong, inclusive and harmonious communities.

“We are committed to empowering our community through education, improving access to information, providing services, infrastructure and locations that cater for pet owners and the wider community.”

The Management Plan for Domestic Animals (Cats and Dogs) was guided by community input provided between 20 July and 31 August 2020.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston, who will be attending the event on Saturday, said the community’s feedback was vital in the plan’s development.

“The community shared their concerns about the management of animals in public spaces, they wanted safe and shared spaces for pet owners and non-pet owners and improved environmental protections and education surrounding pet waste disposal and roaming pets, particularly cats,” Cr Johnston said.

“Three key themes for the plan emerged from the feedback, which were educated informed people, happy healthy pets and safe and inclusive places.”

The plan is guided by the Queensland Government \_Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008\_ and the \_Sunshine Coast Council Local Law No. 2 (Animal Management) 2011\_ and *Subordinate Local Law No. 2*.

Come and meet our pet mascots, Sunny and Sasha, and enjoy some family-friendly fun! Dogs on leash are welcome.
