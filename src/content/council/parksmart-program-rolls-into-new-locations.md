Sunshine Coast Council’s ParkSmart program, which was first introduced into the Caloundra, Birtinya, Point Cartwright and Nicklin Way areas in July, is being rolled out to new locations.

The ParkSmart program trial will introduce its second vehicle, equipped with number plate recognition, high-speed cameras and advanced computer software, into Nambour, Eumundi and the Maroochydore CBD.

Sunshine Coast Council Customer and Planning Services Group Executive Debra Robinson said, just like phase one, there would be a four-week educational period with caution notices issued before infringements would then be imposed.

“The new parking monitoring technology is aimed at encouraging vehicle turnover, creating parking opportunities and allowing equitable and safe access to various locations across our region,” Ms Robinson said.

“It’s also focused on providing a safer work environment for parking officers and reducing the risk of occupational violence.

“We have seen a reduction in occupational violence during the first trial in the Caloundra, Birtinya, Point Cartwright and Nicklin Way areas so we’re keen to continue the trial by adding these further three locations.’’

Ms Robinson said rolling out the program in Eumundi would be key in trialling how well the program performed during large events, like the bi-weekly Eumundi Markets.

“We’re interested to see the benefits and challenges of using this new technology in highly concentrated locations,” she said.

“These findings will be used to consider a possible roll out around major events in the future.

“We also look forward to supporting the local businesses in Nambour as ParkSmart provides greater coverage and capacity to encourage vehicle turnover.  

“Introducing the program in Maroochydore is another step towards further establishing the new CBD.

“The four-week education program will begin on November 21 and continue until December 18.

“During this time, council will issue caution notices rather than infringements.

“Once the education period is over, infringement notices will be issued by post.

“However, the areas may also be patrolled on foot by a Regulated Parking Officer.

“In this case, in line with our current practice, you may still receive your infringement notice on your windscreen.”

**ParkSmart Fast Facts:**

*   During the trial, regulated parking patrols may be carried out by foot patrol or the ParkSmart vehicle with council’s Regulated Parking Officers.
*   If the area has been patrolled by the ParkSmart vehicle, you will receive your caution or infringement notice by post.
*   If the area has been patrolled by a foot patrol, you will receive your infringement notice on your windscreen, which is in line with our current practice.
*   Equipped with number plate recognition, the ParkSmart vehicle is fitted with six high speed cameras and a GPS tracking system.
*   The vehicle captures images of parked vehicles and records the vehicle location (GPS coordinates), number plate and time.
*   It allows council to monitor regulated parking areas to ensure motorists are adhering to parking regulations and ensures equitable and safe access to various parking locations in our region.
*   ParkSmart operates in all weather conditions and identifies regulated parking conditions on the street.
*   Those with a Disability Parking Permit are required under their permit conditions to clearly display the permit on the windshield of their vehicle.
