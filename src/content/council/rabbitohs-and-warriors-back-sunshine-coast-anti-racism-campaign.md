The South Sydney Rabbitohs and Vodafone Warriors have backed the Sunshine Coast’s homegrown [Shine a Light on Racism campaign](https://oursc.com.au/community/new-dawn-begins-with-sunshine-coast-anti-racism-initiative)
.

It follows their local clash at Sunshine Coast Stadium last Saturday.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was pleased to see the *Shine a Light on Racism* campaign receive support from such high-profile teams as the Rabbitohs and the Vodafone Warriors.

“Racism is an issue that has deep impacts, economically, psychologically and socially,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported the campaign since its launch and sincerely thank the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Vodafone Warriors for their backing.

“We hope that the campaign will continue to challenge communities across the region and elsewhere to answer the call to become anti-racist.”

South Sydney Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly said they stood beside Sunshine Coast Council and society in general in the fight against racism.

“There is no place for racism on any level, not just on the sporting field or in the stands at a stadium, but in any part of society,” Mr Solly said.

“We have had instances where our players and staff have suffered from racist attacks and they are simply abhorrent.

“We back Mayor Jamieson and Sunshine Coast Council for this progressive campaign and we’re happy to support this messaging to the Sunshine Coast community and beyond.”

Vodafone Warriors CEO Cameron George echoed the sentiments.

“The fight against racism is one that must go on. It’s a scourge on society,” Mr George said.

“We commend Sunshine Coast Council for its campaign and will continue to do all we can as a club to stamp out racism.” 

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the campaign had received tremendous support since its launch in July.

“It has been encouraging to see the enthusiastic community response to the anti-racism campaign,” Cr Law said.

“As a part of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
, council is committed to continuing to foster a strong community on the Sunshine Coast.

“We all have a role to play in addressing racism in our communities and I am confident that the *Shine a Light on Racism* campaign will continue to be a source of unity and inclusivity on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere.”

*Shine a Light on Racism* patron and Alexandra Surf Club CEO Ashley Robinson OAM said he hoped the Sunshine Coast could continue to be a welcoming place for all residents and visitors.

“I ache about this issue and want to be a part of making change for the better,” Mr Robinson said.

“When I travelled to India and was part of building an orphanage, I became self-aware and recognised that I had previously been racist.

“I was humbled by the beautiful people over there, and since then have tried to be far more aware of other people’s culture and heritage. I hope I can continue that.

“I accepted this role as a patron and as an ally, as I acknowledged that I too, can and should do better.”
