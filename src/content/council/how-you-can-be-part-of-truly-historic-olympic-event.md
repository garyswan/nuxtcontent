Life-sized Olympic Rings and the Paralympic Agitos will make their debut on the Sunshine Coast next weekend, as our region celebrates ‘9 Years To Go’ until the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

It marks the first time since Sydney 2000 that the symbols will be on prominent display in Australia. 

The Olympic rings express the activity of the Olympic Movement and represent the union of the five continents and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world.

The Paralympic Agitos, from the Latin term “I move’’, reflect “Spirit in Motion” and represent the strong will of every Paralympian. Sunshine Coast residents will have the rarest of opportunities to ‘meet’ and capture photos alongside the Rings and Agitos, together with Olympic and Paralympic Athletes, on Saturday, July 22, and Sunday, July 23, at several locations.

Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson said the arrival of the symbols marked another special milestone for our region in the lead up to Brisbane 2032.

“In nine years, when the world tunes in to watch the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Sunshine Coast’s picturesque Alexandra Headland will be front and centre as the planned location for a number of events, including the start and finishing line of the Olympic and Paralympic Marathon,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“So, it’s only fitting that this is the first stop for the Olympic Rings and Paralympic Agitos when they come to our region on July 22 and 23.

“This is a truly historic opportunity for Sunshine Coast families.”

Australian Olympic Committee President, Ian Chesterman said while the athletes of today are focused on qualifying for and competing at Paris 2024 next year, the athletes of tomorrow can be inspired by the arrival of the Rings in Queensland.

“That’s a milestone worth celebrating,” he said.
