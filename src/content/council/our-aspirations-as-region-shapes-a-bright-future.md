The community has embraced one of the largest and most successful engagements ever undertaken on the Sunshine Coast, revealing a range of aspirations as the region shapes its future.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said more than 8000 people had their say on council’s proposed region-wide and local planning directions. 

“With guidance from our [Community Reference Group](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/New-group-to-help-shape-community-input-on-New-Planning-Scheme-Project310821)
, we went out to our community as an early first step so they could help shape the direction of our new planning scheme,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The huge volume of feedback highlighted the varying and sometimes competing views that sit alongside the complex nature of planning for a growing and diverse region.

“With more people choosing to live here, council is committed to the intricate task of planning for growth in healthy, sustainable and creative ways.’’

A detailed analysis of the preliminary consultation feedback revealed the following key community aspirations for the new planning scheme:

*   Protecting the environment 
*   Maintaining a Sunshine Coast vibe  
*   Managing growth  
*   Delivering traffic and transport solutions alongside new development 
*   Parking needs to be adequate  
*   Improving development outcomes 
*   Addressing affordable housing. 

Mayor Jamieson said the feedback had made the engagement one of the largest and most successful ever undertaken by council.

“I would like to once again thank everyone who took the time and effort to provide feedback on planning topics important to them,’’ he said.

“Our community has given insightful and considered feedback on the new planning scheme’s proposed regional directions, local planning areas and other hot planning topics.

“More than 6000 surveys were submitted and a further 375 written submissions were made during the preliminary consultation period.

“Council also gathered community input via a range of online and in-person information and discussion sessions and held meetings and focus interviews with a wide variety of community and stakeholder groups.’’

Mayor Jamieson said community input supported proposed planning directions and highlighted some local area concerns, which would be carefully considered in the drafting phase of the new planning scheme.

“I also hope the preliminary consultation has provided greater community awareness and understanding of some of the [planning scheme processes](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Planning-Documents/New-Sunshine-Coast-Planning-Scheme/Planning-scheme-preparation-process)
.

“There will be more opportunities to have your say on the detail of a draft new planning scheme during the next stage of community consultation.

“I encourage all residents to stay informed by [subscribing to project updates](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme)
&#x20;and participating in future consultation activities.”
