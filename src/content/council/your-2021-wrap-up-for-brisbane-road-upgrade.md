Council would like to thank the community particularly Mooloolaba residents and businesses for their patience while construction continued on the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade during 2021.

As the works continue, lets recap on the progress as we dive into 2022.

Construction of the highly anticipated upgrade of Stage 1b Walan Street between Brisbane Road and Venning Street was completed which widened the corridor to four traffic lanes, introduced a new safer, signalised intersection at Naroo Court, new pedestrian crossing points and new pedestrian pathways.

Ongoing construction in 2022 and 2023 will deliver the second, third and fourth stages of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade.

*Watch the making of Walan Street, Mooloolaba.*

In addition to improving traffic flow, this important project will enhance the southern entrance into Mooloolaba and create a corridor that is integrated and inviting for pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and public transport users.

In June 2021, a large underground tunnel was dug under Mayes Canal. The tunnel accommodates several power conduits as part of upgrading power infrastructure in the area.  

In September, construction started on Phase 1 of the new Mayes Canal Bridge. The new 26.4-metre-wide, four-lane bridge is being built in two phases and will feature shared pedestrian and cycle paths on both sides.

**What’s next for 2022?**

Construction will be underway in multiple areas during January. Stages 2 and 3 construction incorporates the area from the Mayes Canal Bridge to the Brisbane Road-Walan Street-Hancock Street intersection.

Throughout the year upgrades to stormwater, telecommunications (Telstra), power (Energex) and mains water (Unitywater) services will continue along with roadworks including phase two construction of the new Mayes Canal bridge...watch this space!
