Palmwoods Warriors Football Clubhouse

Sunshine Coast Council Deputy Mayor Cr Rick Baberowski said the improvements were made possible thanks to funding from all three tiers of government.

“More than a million dollars has been injected into improving the Warriors Football Club clubhouse and LED lighting to the Graeme Rae oval – vital infrastructure to ensure that clubs can keep pace with the growing popularity of their sports,” Deputy Mayor Baberowski said.

“Sporting clubs like the Warriors Football Club, Hinterland Blues AFL Club and Palmwoods Cricket Club engage with many thousands of participants and are vital to the social fabric of our communities.

“They collectively play an important role in enabling our youth to get active, develop a sense of belonging, while bringing our communities together.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said providing compliant and accessible infrastructure were key principles valued at council and in our community.

“This modern, inclusive clubhouse includes refurbished change areas, canteen, meeting room and office, storage area and public amenities,” Cr Johnston.

“The extensive undercover viewing area is sure to be a crowd pleaser and will provide a massive boost to the sporting clubs for the season and supports sun smart outcomes.

“Overall, it’s a win for the Palmwoods sports precinct, with a total of $2.7 million injected since 2021 when the adjacent Hinterland AFL and Palmwoods cricket clubhouse received a [$1.5 million upgrade.](https://oursc.com.au/community/1-46-million-clubhouse-for-sunshine-coast-afl-and-cricket)

The $560,000 Palmwoods Warriors Football Club project was jointly funded through the Queensland Government’s South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program in association with Sunshine Coast Council and Sunshine Coast Churches Soccer Association.

Member for Nicklin Rob Skelton said the Palaszczuk Government was investing in the Sunshine Coast’s world-class lifestyle.

“We live in one of the best places in Queensland and the Palaszczuk Government is investing to make it even better,” Mr Skelton said.

“We have a great community here and it’ll be made even better with the upgrades to the Palmwoods Warrior’s club, we’re hoping to see more local kids develop a love of sport right here.

“As we approach the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games it’s an exciting time for our kids to get involved in local sports, and hopefully some of them will bring home gold in nine years’ time.

“The Palaszczuk Government’s South East Queensland Stimulus Program has delivered $9 million to help deliver 16 community projects and create 95 good, local jobs.”

New lights are being installed to support cricket and AFL games played on the Graeme Rae Oval.

The new 300 lux LED lights over the wicket box and 200 lux outer field lighting will greatly improve competition and training opportunities.

The $519,000 Palmwoods Cricket/AFL LED lighting project was jointly funded by the Australian Government and Sunshine Coast Council. The Australian Government committing $450,000 through its Local Roads and Community Infrastructure (LRCI) Program.

The LRCI Program supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across the nation, supporting jobs and delivering benefits to local communities.

Federal Member for Fisher Andrew Wallace said the upgrades at Graeme Rae Oval will light up the future for the Hinterland Blues and the Palmwoods Cricket Club.

“Whether it’s footy or cricket, juniors and seniors will now be able to train and play once the sun goes down,” Mr Wallace said.

“The more opportunities for our community the better and that’s why the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is so important to regions like Fisher.”
