Artists from across the nation have just under one month to submit their entries into the [Sunshine Coast Art Prize](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize)
&#x20;— one of the most eagerly anticipated regional art awards in Australia.

Entries are already flowing in from Australia’s best contemporary artists all vying to be selected as a finalist and gain the attention of this year’s judge, the high profile Director of the Museum of Brisbane, and former leader of a number of Queensland’s leading cultural institutions and projects, Renai Grace.

The overall winner of the prestigious Prize will not only take home $25,000, the work will become part of the regional Sunshine Coast Art Collection. The artist will also receive multiple and ongoing promotional opportunities.

There are four prize categories as well as the unique chance for a finalist to be chosen by BMW to be wrapped as an Art Car for the length of the exhibition. The 2021 Sunshine Coast Art Prize is a must entry for professional artists.

Caloundra Regional Gallery Curator Jo Duke said the ease of entry meant artists had nothing to lose.

“The entry fee is $40 and, excitingly for the final 40 artists selected, there are no other costs involved as the freight to and from the gallery and the insurance is covered,” Ms Duke said.

“Entries with artwork images and an artist statement must be submitted online along by 5pm AST (Queensland Time) on 10 May.

“Artworks need to have been completed in the past 24 months, and many artists would have already created suitable works in that time or can start from scratch.”

Community Portfolio Councillor Baberowski said the acquisitive Sunshine Coast Art Prize was steadily pushing itself forward in the Australian calendar of go-ahead and admired visual arts awards in Australia.

“The Art Prize continues to gather a genuinely cutting edge selection of accomplished and emerging artists,” Cr Baberowski said.

“It also further establishes our region as a major hub to showcase where ideas and the arts.”

All entries submitted will be presented for review to a pre-selection panel, from which 40 finalist works will be selected to exhibit in the Sunshine Coast Art Prize 2021 exhibition at the Caloundra Regional Gallery.

“Artworks will be shortlisted by a professional panel based on a set of curatorial rationale including concept, workmanship and originality.

“Once the pre-selection process is complete, artists will be advised of the outcome, with finalists announced in June 2021.”
