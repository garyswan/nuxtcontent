Have you got the jab done? Council is supporting Queensland Health to encourage our community to get COVID-19 vaccinated.

Vaccination is our ticket to a better and brighter future and our best defence in the fight against COVID-19.

We’re only at 77.5 per cent fully vaccinated\*, so we need your help. If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to get your COVID-19 vaccine.

The sooner our community is vaccinated, the greater the likelihood we can start to move on from the pandemic’s impacts on our jobs, our families and many of the things we enjoy.

Undoubtedly COVID-19 has turned our lives upside down, and now is the time for us to come together as a community and “get the jab done” for our own benefit and for the good of the whole community – our parents and grandparents, our children, nieces and nephews and our community’s most vulnerable whose lives are in danger if they are infected with COVID-19.

Once our community is vaccinated, borders are more likely to stay open, our region is less likely to be exposed to the risk of lockdowns and friends and relatives are more likely to be able to visit from interstate and overseas.

Come on, Sunshine Coast. Let’s get the jab done!

Visit Queensland Health’s website [www.health.qld.gov.au](http://www.health.qld.gov.au)
&#x20;for all the information you’ll need to get your COVID-19 vaccination.
