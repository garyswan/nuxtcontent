Sunshine Coast Council will soon start upgrading the intersection of Arthur Street and Bowman Road to provide significant safety improvements and amenity for the 15,000 road users who enter and cross the intersection daily. 

The upgrade will include traffic signals, cycle lanes, pedestrian and cycle crossings, and footpaths to make it easier and safer for all users.

Divisional Councillor Terry Landsberg said he was looking forward to seeing the intersection upgraded to make it more approachable and accessible for users.

“Considering the location and close proximity to schools and sports clubs, it’s especially important we provide safe crossing points for those who ride or walk,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Residents have expressed safety concerns and I am pleased council is making these important upgrades which are expected to start in the week beginning 14 June.  

“Caloundra is an attractive seaside centre and an important hub for the southern part of the region.

“It offers significant business, health, community, education, tourism, sport and recreation activities – so making our road networks safe and accessible is one of council’s key objectives.”

The upgrade is being funded under council’s annual capital works program.

Construction is expected to be complete by September, weather and site conditions permitting.

Community Portfolio and Deputy Mayor Rick Baberowski said the community will be pleased to see council progressively deliver a more resilient road network to cater for our region’s growth.

“This intersection upgrade is designed to improve overall safety and cater for increased traffic volumes,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The good news is that the intersection will remain open during construction, however it’s important that all commuters show patience and allow some extra time to reach their destination during the works.

“Can I remind locals that private properties and nearby businesses (that need your support) will remain accessible throughout the construction period.

“Can I take this opportunity to promote Council’s excellent free online tool called Roads Hub which is designed to help motorists plan ahead and be aware of road works or other events which may impact traffic.

“As is standard procedure, traffic management and signage will be in place to ensure the safety of pedestrians, motorists and the construction team carrying out the works.”

Council will continue to keep nearby property owners, businesses and other stakeholders updated prior to works starting and during construction to provide details about specific activities, temporary traffic changes and periodic night works.
