Whether you’re holidaying at home or visiting the Sunshine Coast, everyone is asked to continue to mask up even though the Greater Brisbane lockdown has ended. 

The Chief Health Officer has made it a requirement in all areas of Queensland that you must carry a face mask with you at all times when you leave home, unless you have a lawful reason not to.

You must wear a mask in indoor spaces and it is strongly recommended you wear a mask when outdoors if you are unable to stay more than 1.5 metre distance from other people.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson has said that council fully supports compliance with the directions of the Chief Health Officer and that the community must do likewise in order to help prevent the transmission of this highly infectious strain of COVID-19.

“Holidays are a special time for family and friends to come together but please keep your loved ones’ health front of mind,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I urge every member of our community and every person visiting our Sunshine Coast to comply with the government directions to help keep us all safe. 

“The Sunshine Coast is expected to be busy during the holiday period and it’s essential we all work together to keep on top of any risk of community transmission.”

Mayor Jamieson said there was no room for complacency, and everyone could do their part by complying with mask wearing.

“And please, stay home if you are sick and if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, get tested.

“If you are out and about stay 1.5 metres away from other people, think two big steps.

“Wash your hands with soap and water, or hand sanitiser and leave a location if it’s crowded.”

Children under 12 years and people affected by a medical condition or disability which makes wearing a face mask unsuitable, are exempt from wearing a mask.

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in when visiting places like cafes and restaurants, and to provide accurate contact details.

Customers who need to contact council are encouraged to do so via the phone or online if possible, rather than visiting a counter.

Customers can call our locally-based call centre on 5475 7272 or 1300 007 272 during business hours (8.15am – 5pm) Monday to Friday. After hours, our call centre takes emergency calls.
