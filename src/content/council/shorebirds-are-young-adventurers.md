Young migratory shorebirds are the last ones to arrive on our shores.

At only a few months old, these young birds navigate their long migration alone without their parents.

What an adventure for those young birds!

Share our shores and keep your distance to allow those young birds to settle in after their first overseas trip.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
