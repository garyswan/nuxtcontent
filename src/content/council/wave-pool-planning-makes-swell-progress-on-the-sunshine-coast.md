A world-class wave pool has progressed further along the planning pipeline, following Sunshine Coast Council’s approval for a Tourist Attraction (Surf Park) at Glass House Mountains.

The proposal aims to deliver a wave pool, amenities, a wellness centre, paddock to plate food and beverage, ocean and marine protection education, learn to surf classes and surf coaching.

The theme park is proposed for the western side of Bruce Highway stop, Moby Vic’s, at Glass House Mountains.

Deputy Mayor and Divisional Councillor Rick Baberowski said the approval represented a major planning milestone for the project and was potentially a critical step towards the first major new tourism offering on the Sunshine Coast in decades.

“Once completed, this surf park will attract a new range of visitors to our region, visitors who would most likely extend their length of stay and generate a substantial economic benefit,” Cr Baberowski said.

“These sorts of development are a significant sign of further confidence in the future of our region, which all helps to deliver new facilities and services to meet the needs of our communities.

“Our tourism industry contributes $3 billion to our local economy every year and our offering on the Sunshine Coast needs to continue to dynamically evolve to appeal to a wide variety of interests.

“At the end of the day, our community is the ultimate winner as we continue to attract appropriate new investment to our healthy, smart and creative region.”

Surf Parks Australia lodged its application in December last year and [Sunshine Coast Council’s Economic Resurgence Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Regional-Economy/Economic-Resurgence-Plan)
&#x20;has helped fast-track this major hinterland development, boosting business confidence and providing much needed stimulus to the tourism sector.

Surf Parks Australia CEO Craig Morrison thanked council for the ongoing support throughout the development application and investment assistance program process.

“We appreciate the strong support from council, their assistance and diligent approach to ensuring all relevant planning matters were thoroughly addressed.” Mr Morrison said.

“We strategically selected the Moby Vic’s location for this project due to its ease of access, proximity to both the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay regions as well as the added benefit of minimal disruption to our community and our local environment.

“The overall development will support the local building and construction industry as well as provide future employment for locals.

“It is predicted that around 60 -100 jobs are likely to be provided both directly and indirectly as a result of the construction of this development, expected to start as early as next year.

“It will provide future employment opportunities for a number of tourism professionals.” 

As part of the state government legislated approval process, a material change of use approval is required from council when a developer proposes a new use of a premises.

Council’s development assessment team approved the proposed tourist attraction on December 9, 2021. A number of further permits will be required before construction can start.
