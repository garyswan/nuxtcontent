Calling all Sunshine Coast schools and students keen to make a difference to the environment. Sunshine Coast Council’s Kids in Action program is back in 2022 for its 10th year and limited spaces are now available.

The award-winning, hands-on environmental education program is suitable for students in Years 5-8.

It connects our young custodians with the environment, culture, community mentors and each other while developing their leadership and active citizenship skills along the way.

This year’s theme, ‘Catchment Connections: Mountains to the Sea’, will explore the movements and relationships of the Coast’s waterways, plants, and animals.

The students will also discover cultural knowledge and places of significance that are woven within these pathways across high country and low country landscapes.

The theme will be further unpacked with Traditional Custodians and community mentors at the Environmental Projects Day on Friday, May 6.

From these learnings, school students will build project presentations to deliver and inspire each other at the outdoor Kids Teaching Conference on Friday, September 9 at the Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden.

Last year Buddina State School students volunteered to become ‘Rubbish Rejectors’ for the 2021 Kids in Action Conference.

The team of Rubbish Rejectors were mentored by council’s waste education officer to develop a plan to work towards a zero-waste event.

The Rubbish Rejectors team created a main stage presentation to identify themselves and their role at the 2021 Conference.

They explained the colour-coded waste-stream bin systems used at the conference and demonstrated to attendees how to use the bins correctly.

Buddina State School students monitored and supervised the waste station all day, supporting participants in making good waste separation choices, and working towards a zero-waste event. They have provided recommendations for the 2022 program to further reduce waste.

Sunshine Coast Council Environmental and Sustainability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the program continued to be a great success for our region.

“I would like to thank all of the team involved in the Kids in Action program and express my gratitude for everyone’s work in rising to the challenges and uncertainty that 2021 presented,” Cr Suarez said.

“The main stage presentation and the accompanying props were extremely effective, and we received amazing feedback from many people regarding the students’ performance.

“The expressions of interest for Kids in Action are open again so I would encourage schools to register for 2022.”

Places are limited, so express your interest now for this exciting and rewarding program in 2022 [Kids in Action Expression of Interest (sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/BI6mCBNqvztVXgZNHjwPT0?domain=sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)
