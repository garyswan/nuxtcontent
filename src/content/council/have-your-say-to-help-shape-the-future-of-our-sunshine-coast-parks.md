Whether you’re picnicking with friends, exploring playgrounds with little ones, connecting with nature, improving your fitness or celebrating a special occasion – our Sunshine Coast parks offer many different opportunities for everyone.  

Sunshine Coast Council is asking the community to review the new Draft Recreation Parks Plan and provide feedback on the future of the region’s parks.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the plan was created to outline the strategic direction for recreation parks across the region.

“Now we need our community’s help to ensure it reflects what you expect of your parks on the Sunshine Coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This plan will be a tool that supports council’s commitment to preserving spaces and parks that enhance the natural character of the Sunshine Coast’s environment.

“For many of us, our experiences of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has made us appreciate how wonderful it is to get outside and explore what our parks have to offer.

“So don’t miss the opportunity to help shape the future of parks in our Sunshine Coast.”

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said recreation parks were at the heart of the Sunshine Coast’s diverse landscape and lifestyle.

“Our parks provide us with space for social, recreational and cultural activities, connecting us with nature and providing a huge variety of opportunities to enjoy,” Cr Suarez said.

“The Recreation Parks Plan is one of many ways council is delivering on its Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS), which provides long-term direction to guide growth and shape the future of our region.

“It will also assist policy makers and park planners within council and the development industry to design and deliver recreation parks that achieve council’s strategic goals.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the plan demonstrated council’s intention to enhance the variety of services that recreation parks provide for our Sunshine Coast communities.

“It’s our diverse green spaces across our region, from the hinterland to the coast and everywhere in between which complement the character of the region and add to a healthy, smart and creative region,” Cr Law said.

“The Recreation Parks Plan will also assist the local community understand how, why and where council locates park activities and the infrastructure that supports them.”

Sunshine Coast teen and environmental campaigner Ella Woodborne, who was recognised as the region’s Young Citizen of the Year in 2020, called on local youth to make their voice heard.

“As a 17-year-old, I think it’s so important our local government has great plans in place to guide what our parks will be like in the future,” Ms Woodborne said.

“I’m asking other teens and young adults on the Sunshine Coast to check out this new plan, fill out the survey and take this opportunity to tell council what you really think.

 “In my own school I’ve been a passionate ambassador for our environment and our parks provide much needed green spaces throughout our towns.

“They are lovely places to spend time outside and help people get a better understanding of our precious ecosystem.”
