Accolades are flowing for Sunshine Coast Council’s development industry and the Construction Management and Waterway Protection program after it brought home a major title.

The program has claimed the Award for Excellence in Policy and Education at the 2022 Stormwater Queensland Awards.

The award recognises excellence in policy, regulation, educational programs and activities that foster the sustainable use and management of stormwater.

Council successfully launched the Construction Management and Waterway Taskforce in June 2021, initially as part of a three-year program funded by Council’s Environment Levy.

<https://oursc.com.au/council-news/creating-a-greener-future-through-your-environment-levy>


The Taskforce is working with developers, consultants, contractors and builders in the region to improve construction management practices and levels of compliance, particularly regarding erosion and sediment control to improve our region’s waterway and wetland health.

To date, over 1000 dump trucks full of sediment have been saved from running into our region’s waterways and damaging crucial ecosystems, through improved controls on development and building sites.

Council wish to thank key players who have been part of the improvement journey including Master Builders, Urban Development Institute of Australia (UDIA), Property Council of Australia (PCA), Sunshine Coast Environmental Council, Healthy Land & Water, Engineers Australia, Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES), developers, consultants, and builders.

**How Council is helping to lead the way**

Supporting the education of development and building industry on the coast, is Councils new Regional Erosion and Sediment, Education and Trialtraining site (the RESET site).

Sunshine Coast Council held two Erosion and Sediment Field days at the site in August in conjunction with the International Erosion Control Association (IECA). 

More than 100 local contractors and consultants attended events to learn more about controlling erosion and sediment

Council is also committed to ensuring that its own capital and maintenance works are undertaken in environmentally responsible manner.

Council held internal training days, with 160 internal staff attending training delivered by council’s Catchment Management, Project Delivery and Civil Asset Management teams.

The site was Highly Commended in the Innovation or Education to the Erosion and Sediment Control Industry category at the recent IECA Australasia Awards 2022.

***SINCE THE TASKFORCE COMMENCED***

*   There has been 30% improvement in compliant building sites
*   Compliance at larger construction sites is 35% above South East Queensland average.

**Truckloads of Sediment Saved**

**FAST FACTS:**

In the first 12 months of the program the CMWP Taskforce has:

*   Presented on the program and erosion and sediment requirements to over 15 groups, including at Master Builders influencers session.
*   Conducted 526  building site inspections sessions,
*   Visited 128 unique building companies,
*   Conducted 107 inspections for large civil construction sites,
*   Worked with 33 unique civil contractors.

Keep an eye out for the Taskforce team members in the “Is your Site Right?” cars!
