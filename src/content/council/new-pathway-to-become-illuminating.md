A Sippy Down’s pathway garnering heavy foot traffic to the Coast’s education precinct will be made a whole lot brighter.

Sunshine Coast Council has started construction along Claymore Road footpath in Sippy Downs.  

Twenty-nine LED lights will be installed between Sippy Downs Drive to Bainbridge Circuit which will greatly improve the thoroughfare’s safety at night.

Many students and locals walk, ride and scoot along the pathways connecting the community to nearby shops, schools and the local university and sports precinct.

Works are expected to be completed by mid-May 2023. Watch this space!

This project was funded by the Australian Government’s Local Roads and Community Infrastructure (LRCI) Program in association with Sunshine Coast Council.
