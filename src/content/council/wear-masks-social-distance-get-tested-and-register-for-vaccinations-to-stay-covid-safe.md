Wear a mask for the next two weeks, be COVID alert and get vaccinated.

That’s the message from Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson, following Queensland Health issuing COVID-19 contact tracing alerts for parts of the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane.

“Wear a mask from now (this is mandatory from 1am on Tuesday, 29 June) and for the next two weeks when you are out and about, and comply with Queensland Health directions including handwashing, social distancing, checking in to any venues and indoor spaces that you visit and get tested if you have any symptoms,” Mayor Jamieson said.

Mayor Jamieson urged Sunshine Coast residents and visitors to check Queensland Health’s website regularly for updates, stay COVID alert and register for vaccination if you are eligible to be vaccinated and have not already registered.

“Contact tracing is underway following recent confirmed cases in the community and information on the Queensland Health website will be updated as it comes to hand.

“If you were in any of the identified locations, available on Queensland Health’s website, please isolate and get tested,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Also, if you have already had your first vaccination and are due to receive your second dose, it is critical that you follow up and get the second vaccination.

“We’re in this together and the Sunshine Coast has done a great job keeping our community safe so far, let’s keep it up.

“I urge every member of our community and every person visiting our Sunshine Coast to be COVID-19 alert to help keep us all safe.”

Mayor Jamieson said anyone with any COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, should get tested.

“Options for [testing](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/stay-informed/testing-and-fever-clinics)
&#x20;are listed on Queensland Health’s website and include a drive-through testing clinic at Caloundra Aerodrome, 14 Pathfinder Drive, Caloundra West from 7am to 3pm weekdays. A GP referral is **not** needed for testing.

“Social distancing remains essential, stay 1.5 metres away from other people, think two big steps.

“Wash your hands with soap and water, or hand sanitiser and leave a location if it’s crowded.”

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in using the Queensland Government QR code when visiting places like cafes and restaurants, and to provide accurate contact details.

“If you are attending any events on the Sunshine Coast, I ask you to please comply with the COVID safe steps put in place by the organisers,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We want everyone to keep safe and comply with the COVID-19 precautions and mandatory mask wearing (from 1am, 29 June).

“And remember, if you are eligible to be vaccinated and haven’t already organised to do so, there is no better time than now.

“Visit Queensland Health’s website to register your details.”
