Sunshine Coast Council’s first resident historians are embarking on two new projects to fill key gaps in our region’s sporting and First Nation’s history.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the University of the Sunshine Coast PhD sports history student, Kate Kirby and historian Dr Ray Kerkhove would deliver two separate projects to expand the regions local history knowledge and increase the understanding of council’s collections.

Ms Kirby will take her research into the community to explore our rich sporting history with her project Sunshine Coast Gold 1901 to 2021.

“This project will examine local high-performing athletes winning on the world stage, as well as community sport, memories and stories, monuments, and the built environment,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The project will be a terrific way to shine a light on our local sporting legends as the Sunshine Coast prepares to play a key role in the 2032 Olympic Games.

“Ms Kirby’s research will reveal behind the scenes achievers including coaches, administrators, volunteers and community leaders.

“Dr Kerkhove’s project will identify First Nations’ places, pathways and their associated Traditional Custodian names on the Sunshine Coast.

“Dr Kerkhove is a renowned historian and his research will map important historical First Nations locations and provide an index of interpretations and meaning.

Sunshine Coast Council Cultural Heritage Services coordinator Peter Connell said the community was invited to get involved in the project.

“At the start of each residency we will invite the community to attend open conversation sessions with each historian so people can share their stories or provide avenues for research based on the historian’s topic,” Mr Connell said.

“Each historian will also present their findings after the completion of their residency at public talks.

“The topics selected by the historian reflect their areas of expertise and show how diverse historical research can be, and how the Coast’s history and heritage relates to everyone in our community.”

Dr Kerkhove will be resident historian at Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct in the Glass House Mountains.

His First Nations mapping research adds to his existing cultural mapping of the Greater Brisbane area.

While in residence, Dr Kerkhove will also examine council’s Bankfoot House collection to explore the relationship between First Nations peoples and this early settler family.

Kate Kirby will be resident historian at the Heritage Library at Nambour. Her project supports her earlier research of rural Queensland including sports history research of Townsville, Charters Towers, Mount Isa, Rockhampton and Gladstone.

The community is invited to contribute to the projects by emailing relevant information to the Cultural Heritage Services team at culturalheritage\@sunshinecoast.gld.gov.au or phoning 54208600.

Further information on the program can be found on [council’s heritage website](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Historian-in-Residence)
.

This initiative is supported by The Heritage Levy, which is  used to document, research, conserve, protect, promote and provide access to those tangible and intangible items, places, facilities and events that define the stories, history and values of the people, communities and culture of the Sunshine Coast.
