Eumundi’s main thoroughfare is headed for a vibrant improvement which will celebrate its heritage, character and importantly the community’s vision.

Sunshine Coast Council has been working with the community for more than a year, to help shape the future of Memorial Drive.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said he asked residents in October last year what they loved about Memorial Drive and what could be improved.

“Since then, council has been working with the local community and businesses to gain further ideas and feedback through business surveys and community workshops to help develop the Draft Streetscape Concept Design,” Cr Law said.

“Our Design and Placemaking team has been collating feedback and translating that into a placemaking approach which celebrates the very essence of Eumundi’s main street through a natural look and feel.

“This design is an opportunity to involve our community and seek their feedback about how its function, character and identity can be boosted to support Eumundi as a popular local place and destination.

Memorial Drive, Eumundi.

“I thank the community for being patient while we look at all aspects of the design, before we ask for further feedback in the new year.

“Council will ask the community, ‘Have we got it right?’ in how we have translated their values and vision into the concept design.

“You can view the Draft Streetscape Concept Design and provide feedback by speaking with the project team at one of the drop-in sessions being held in Eumundi’s CWA Hall, in late-January 2022.

“If you don’t have time to attend, you can complete the survey online (open for four weeks) by visiting council’s website – but for now, save the date and we will provide you more details closer to the time it goes live.”

All ideas are subject to further community and business feedback, technical feasibility and budget considerations. Final designs will be produced for these streetscape improvements, with construction anticipated to start mid-2022.

The $1.77 million Eumundi Streetscape Placemaking design and construction project has been funded by council, with $500,000 contributed by the Queensland Government’s COVID Works for Queensland program. 

More information about the placemaking project can be found on the Have Your Say website <https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/eumundi-placemaking>

**Background information: Environmental sensors**

Research and data has become fundamental to the design to improve the streetscape’s longevity. Council’s Smart City team, in conjunction with the Placemaking Team, is also installing an environmental sensor and gateway to better understand climate information.

More than 50 sensors are installed in various locations across the Sunshine Coast. The detailed temperature information collected by the sensors will enable council to further research the effects of increasing heat in our urban and peri-urban areas.

This information will be used to improve planning and design of public areas, such as the use of materials and colours which reduce heat and increase canopy cover to provide cooler and more comfortable open spaces and streets for our community.

This [cool technology](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Cool-technologies-to-beat-the-heat)
&#x20;goes hand in hand with council’s placemaking approach to engage and collaborate with communities to create meaningful and vibrant places that reflect their values.
