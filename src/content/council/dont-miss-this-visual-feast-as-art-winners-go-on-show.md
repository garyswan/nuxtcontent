They impressed the judges of this hotly contested art prize and now you have the chance to see them at a special free exhibition.

Described as a feast for the eyes, the winning works are part of a competition that attracted entries from throughout the nation.

A delicate and complex layering of materials and textures created by Kate Tucker took out the top gong in this year’s [Sunshine Coast Art Prize](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2022-Finalists)
, which carried a $25,000 prize.

The Victorian artist’s compelling piece, titled ‘Carve time / print space’, (correct) is a timely reminder of the importance of viewing art in person, rather than on a screen.

It will be on show, along with the other leading award entries, until October 16 at Caloundra Regional Gallery at 22 Omrah Avenue, Caloundra.

The gallery is open from 10am to 4pm Tuesday to Friday, 10am to 2pm Saturday and Sunday and admission is free. 

Sunshine Coast Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the exhibition was an important touchstone of contemporary art and a immersive journey everyone could appreciate.

“It provides a unique insight into this volatile year from an Australian perspective and has been depicted by leading contemporary 2D artists,” Cr Baberowski said. 

“The winners’ composition also cleverly nods to the history of painting, but it’s through the use of digital printing where ‘Carve time / print space’ is also reflective of our progressively digital era, while speaking to the challenges we faced during a global pandemic.

“If you have not had the opportunity to view these pieces, I encourage you to take the time and visit Caloundra Regional Gallery to explore and soak in the exhibited artworks.”

Ms Tucker will now stake her claim in the region’s art history with her winning artwork being acquired into the [Sunshine Coast Art Collection](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Collections/Art-Collection)
, an impressive assembly of more than 880 works.

Speaking about her own work, Ms Tucker said the painting came together slowly amid the continuing disruptions over the last two years. 

“Lockdowns kept me out of the studio on and off for years, and when my workspace and tools became available again, I had to process the sudden removal of constraints,” Ms Tucker said.

“I referenced pictures of people making things with their hands and in their homes, as I tried to make work what felt true to being an artist now.

“I’m honoured that my work will be acquired into the Sunshine Coast Art Collection by way of this award.”

A 10 vinyl-cut relief print with hand-coloured watercolours took out the Highly Commended prize and has been a talking point throughout the exhibition.

Sunshine Coast Art Prize guest judge Ellie Buttrose said Tamika Grant-Iramu’s ‘Undulations’ advocated for the need to not only look closely at art but also the world around us.

“Celebrating small plants that might otherwise go unnoticed, Ms Grant-Iramu’s fine lines draw the viewers’ attention to the physical intricacies of Australian Lemon Myrtle and Mount Blackwood Holly,” Ms Buttrose said.

“By highlighting both native and introduced species the work also expresses the way that the landscape has been and continues to be shaped by human influence.”

Ms Grant-Iramu said she was thrilled to receive the award.

“Throughout my creative practice I have often been intrigued by the complexities of nature, focusing on the minute areas of flora that tend to go unnoticed,” Ms Grant-Iramu said.

“Drawing on the repetitive mark-making techniques of vinyl-cut carving, ‘Undulations’ explores native and introduced plant life from the Southeast Queensland and Mackay regions, showcasing the Australian Lemon Myrtle and Mount Blackwood Holly.

“The small nature of these plants is amplified, brought to the foreground to be celebrated and experienced by the viewer, while remaining connected to the diversity and organic complexity of Queensland’s coastal landscape.

“The rhythm of these carved lines undulates across the length of the artwork, capturing the expansive nature of our environment that is constantly changing and evolving into something new.”

The Residency prize was awarded to Gerwyn Davies for his archival pigment print, ‘Mirror 2021’.

Mr Davies’ work was prompted by an interest in the gaudy world of stage magic, its elaborate displays of smoke and mirrors, spectacular tricks of the eye and confounding sleights of hand.

Caloundra Regional Gallery Manager and Curator Ms Jo Duke said one of the most coveted categories was the People’s Choice Prize.

“The winner in this category is Roman Longginou for his work ‘Tension’,’’ Ms Duke said.
