Sunshine Coast residents with any signs of being unwell are strongly urged to get a COVID-19 test as Queensland’s Chief Health Officer sets a statewide target for 40,000 daily tests.

If you have any of the following symptoms - fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea, loss of smell or loss of taste – please make arrangements to get tested immediately.

Other symptoms people may experience include muscle or joint pain, and loss of appetite.

If you are unsure if your symptoms could be COVID-related, get tested.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor and Local Disaster Management Group chair Mark Jamieson said additional [testing](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/stay-informed/testing-and-fever-clinics)
&#x20;locations were open across the Sunshine Coast region and details were available on the Queensland Health website.

“Thousands of people have already been tested, but we need to significantly increase the testing numbers to help keep us all safe,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We are also again urging people to stay home and not to be out in our community unless it is for one of the limited essential reasons.

“Parks, playgrounds, skate parks and our tips are among the facilities closed in a bid to discourage people moving around our community unnecessarily. For a full list of changes to council services and facilities, visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/COVID19)
.

“Businesses operating essential services are permitted to access council’s waste facilities during the lockdown period and should use cashless payment.

“Signage is in place advising where council facilities are closed, and the advice must be observed.”

The Sunshine Coast local government area is among 11 areas across south east Queensland in an extended lockdown until 4pm Sunday 8 August.

Under the directives issued by the Queensland Chief Health Officer, residents can only leave their home for limited permitted purposes such as:

• obtaining essential goods or services within 10 kilometres, including healthcare

• exercise (within a 10-kilometre radius from home)

• attending essential work or childcare or school for the children of essential workers

• assisting vulnerable persons

•           obtaining a COVID-19 test or vaccination.

Under lock down provisions no visitors are allowed at your residence (excluding volunteers and workers), unless providing support to a vulnerable person.

**Be COVID-19 alert**

If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, call your doctor or 13HEALTH (13 43 25 84) and get tested.

Call emergency services on Triple Zero (000) if you are very sick.
