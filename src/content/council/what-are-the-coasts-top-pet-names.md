Our favourite pet names for 2022 have been revealed.

Bella and Charlie have taken the top two places for dogs and cats registered with Sunshine Coast Council.

Rounding out the Top 5 for felines this time was Luna, Mia and Molly, while for pooches, it was Molly, Ruby and Buddy.

Whatever you call your best mate, it’s now time to renew their registration.

Annual pet registration renewals are on the way, either by post or email, to owners of the more than 65,335 cats and dogs registered on the Sunshine Coast – that’s over 1040 more than last year.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said pet registration helped council ensure the Sunshine Coast was a great home for your furry friend.

“Pet registration helps council officers reunite lost pets with their owners,” Cr Johnston said.

“It also provides funding for pet-related services like animal management, responsible pet ownership education programs and support our pet partnerships through council’s grants programs.

“Information gathered from pet registration also helps council plan for dog parks, off-leash areas and other pet facilities, where they’re needed most.

“With so many new faces on the Sunshine Coast in the past year, this is a friendly reminder to register your dog or cat, if you haven’t already done so.

“New residents can transfer their cat or dog registration from another region for free if registered within 14 days of moving to the Sunshine Coast.

“It’s also worth letting us know if your pet’s details have changed as we may be able to offer a discount.”

Discounts apply for desexed pets, with the cost being just $24 or free if you have a current pensioner card and your pet is both desexed and microchipped.

There is also the option of a lifetime registration for desexed and microchipped cats – only $87 with no annual renewal fee required.

Registration is free for pets under six-months-old.

The annual registration period for cats and dogs starts on October 1 each year and runs through until September 30 the following year.

Renewal of pet registration is due by **September 30**.

There are several convenient payment methods available, including online payments via [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
 or BPay, over the phone or at a council customer contact centre. Where possible, online payment is preferred.

Pet owners can also update their pet’s details, including changes to desexing, microchipping and pensioner details or cancelling your pet’s registration if you no longer own your pet, via [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
 or an [online form](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Cat-and-Dog-Registration/Updating-Registration-Details)
&#x20;on council’s website.

Dog registration is required under the Queensland Government Animal Management (Cats & Dogs) Act 2008 and cat registration is required under Sunshine Coast Council [Local Law No. 2 (Animal Management) 2011](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Local-Laws)
