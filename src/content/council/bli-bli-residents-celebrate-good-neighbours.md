Spirits were high and everyone knew each other’s name as neighbours in Lotus Place, Bli Bli, gathered together recently (13 February) for a festive street party after winning Sunshine Coast Council’s Covid Kindness Neighbourly Stories competition.

Dozens of neighbourhoods across the Sunshine Coast entered the competition last year, where people were asked to share stories of outstanding acts of kindness during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lotus Place was selected for their many kind gestures, including holding an ANZAC dawn service together, writing chalk messages on the street for the elderly and maintaining each other’s lawns.

Resident Andrew Mortimer has lived in Lotus Place for nine years.

“We normally hold a street party every year or two, but last year it was put on hold due to the pandemic,” Mr Mortimer said.

“This year’s street party was a fantastic get together and we thank council for arranging it. It was so nice to see the children having fun with the jumping castle, craft activities and entertainment.

“Bli Bli itself is a lovely region and the sense of community is really high.

“Friendships have really developed over time. We’re always there for each other and always borrowing an onion or cornflour for a recipe. We’ve pulled each other’s dogs off the street and help put each other’s bins away.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez attended the street party and helped present another crucial element to the prize, a $1500 evacuation kit donated by the State Government.

“There’s some wonderfully caring communities on the Sunshine Coast and the residents of Lotus Place should be very proud of being a crucial part of that social fabric,” Cr Suarez said.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Neighbourly Stories competition was a strong vision of council’s At Home in My Neighbourhood [program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/covidkindness)
.

“Strong neighbourhoods result in connected communities that form the foundation of our region and it’s great to see these wonderful community champions,” Cr Law said.
