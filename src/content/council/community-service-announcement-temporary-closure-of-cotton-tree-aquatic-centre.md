The Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre will be closed from 7pm Wednesday (February 8) to ensure public safety as remediation works are carried out on the facility’s pool lighting towers and inground infrastructure.

These works are part of a lighting infrastructure renewal at the facility. 

Council expects the facility to remain closed for at least a week but will do its best to return the centre to normal operations as quickly as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience and will continue to provide updates on when the centre will re-open.
