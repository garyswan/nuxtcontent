Investments in the next stage of Buderim Village Park, lighting upgrades to sporting fields, cycle lanes at Rosemount and sealing of a much-used carpark at Buderim are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 7. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford said council would invest in many worthy projects across the community.\
“There is a $755,000 budget allocation to design the Wises Road and Sugar intersection upgrade at Maroochydore,” Cr Hungerford said.\
“Another $670,000 will be invested in Stage 9 of Buderim Village Park on the corner of Church and King Streets.\
“Council purchased this 3.4 hectare piece of land in 2010 to develop it into an open, green, district-level park.

“Buderim Village Park has become enormously popular with the local community and visitors to our region and I’m really excited to see this next stage of its development.\
“This will include a new playground, shade over the playground, garden arbour, pedestrian pathways and landscaping works.\
“In keeping with council’s strong commitment to our environment and sustainability, the Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex will undergo a renewal of existing field lighting, replacing them with energy efficient LED lights and fittings.\
“The Maroochydore Junior Rugby League fields will also receive a $250,000 lighting upgrade and $120,000 has been committed for renewals to the popular Buderim Aquatic Centre in Buderim.\
“There will be a number of important investments in transportation infrastructure within Division 7, including new cycle lanes on Petrie Creek Road at Rosemount.\
“The Main Street, Buderim off-road car park will be formalised and sealed, and new retaining structures will be constructed on Vista Park Drive and Forestwood Drive in Buderim.”\
Cr Hungerford said a large number of parks and gardens projects within Division 7 were included in this year’s budget.\
“Ash Road Park in Diddilibah, Lions Lookout Park, Deloraine Drive Park and Wirreanda Park in Buderim and Cod Hole Park in Maroochydore will all undergo renewal works to playground equipment,” Cr Hungerford said.\
“Timbertop Park and The Woods Park in Buderim will receive upgrades and new naming signs will be installed in Deloraine Drive Park and Irene Sheen Court Park in Buderim.\
“I’m also very pleased to see $350,000 in the budget to start renewing the dilapidated drainage under Buderim Palmwoods Heritage Trail and a renewal and upgrade of the Buderim Forest Park track from the Quorn Close end of the reserve to meet increasing visitation demands.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
