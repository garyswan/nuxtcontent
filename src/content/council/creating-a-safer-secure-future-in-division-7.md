Investing $3.6 million towards a new pedestrian and cyclist bridge on Stringybark Road, Buderim, completing the tramway trail and undertaking significant upgrades to stormwater management infrastructure are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 7.

Divisional councillor Ted Hungerford said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future across the region.

“Starting the new pedestrian and cyclist bridge on the western side of the existing road bridge on Stringybark Road, Buderim, which crosses over the Sunshine Coast Motorway will make a huge difference to the lives of local residents,” Cr Hungerford said.

“This important piece of infrastructure will provide safer connectivity between Buderim and Sippy Downs and enable residents to adopt more sustainable and active transport.

“Council will also invest more than $2.4 million in new and upgraded stormwater quality management infrastructure across Division 7.

“Planning and design to upgrade the intersection of Sugar Road and Wises Road will start, Maroochydore as well as construction upgrades to the existing roundabout intersection at Stringybark Road and Gleneagle Court at Buderim to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety.

“I’m also very pleased to announce more than $709,000 has been allocated to construct a pedestrian pathway from MacKenzie Green, up the hill crossing Crosby Hill Road, Scenic Avenue, William Street at Buderim and joining into the existing pathway.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
