Sunshine Coast drivers are urged to consider whether travel is necessary over the coming days, with significant rainfall expected to continue.

Some parts of the Sunshine Coast have received more than 170mm over the last 24 hours.

Local Disaster Coordinator Tom Jamieson said the road network had been severely impacted and Council’s disaster management team was keeping a close eye on the evolving situation.

He urged the community to access weather warnings and road closures at Council’s Disaster Hub.

For a full list of closed roads on the Sunshine Coast visit: [disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](http://disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

“This one-stop-shop provides all the information our community requires regarding the local situation,” Mr Jamieson said.

“It includes links to airport updates, traffic cameras, flood mapping, and Council’s news updates and social media.

“There have been no reports of damage, however we are continually monitoring our local road situation.

“Roads will be slippery so please take care and have patience.

“Remember when it comes to driving through flood waters – if it’s flooded, forget it.”

For life threatening emergencies call 000.

For emergency help in storms and floods including a request for sand bags call **SES 13 25 00**.

For regular weather updates, you can also tune into your local radio station.

The community can contact Council to report any issues via the Council [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council)
&#x20;including the live chat option.
