Sunshine Coast building approvals reached a record level of $1.9 billion for the 2020/21 financial year.

Sunshine Coast Council Service Delivery Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said council’s [Development Indictors Annual Highlights report](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Development-Tools-and-Guidelines/Development-Indicators-Report)
&#x20;reflected activity in our development and building sector.

“Considering the events of the past year, this report shows that confidence in our local building and construction industry remained high throughout the pandemic,” Cr Dickson said.  

“Locals have jumped at the chance to renovate their homes with around 18,500 development applications lodged, ranging from renovations to extensions, plumbing and drainage works, subdividing and much more.

“The report reflects record high plumbing and drainage work approvals and inspections, plus 2463 new lots created.

“Work is steadily continuing on the development of our new CBD at Maroochydore and the surrounding areas are experiencing rapid growth, with building activity higher than previous years.

“As outlined in the report, suburbs like Buderim, Bokarina and Palmview experienced significant building activity as well as the Caloundra South suburbs of Baringa and Nirimba.

“It was very pleasing to see council’s award-winning [Development.i platform](https://developmenti.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;continue to empower our community by providing information on local development matters from the comfort and safety of their homes through uncertain times.

“Development.i was accessed more than 347,000 times – an increase of 41 per cent in usage on the previous year.

“More than 360,000 free [Development.i site reports](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Development-Tools-and-Guidelines/Development-i-Site-Report)
&#x20;were generated over the past 12 months. That’s around 6900 reports a week and an overall increase of 57 per cent compared to the last financial year.”

In response to economic impacts caused by the pandemic, council has been able to respond to industry demand to streamline approvals, stimulating our local economy.

“Council has focused on maximising incentives to bring forward ‘shovel ready’ projects and generate significant employment and capital investment across the region.

Fellow Service Delivery Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said council would continue supporting our local building and construction industry through [Sunshine Coast Council’s Economic Resurgence Plan.](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Regional-Economy/Economic-Resurgence-Plan?utm_source=Corporate&utm_medium=Spotlights&utm_campaign=Economic%20Resurgence%20Plan&utm_term=Economic%20Resurgence%20Plan)


“Our council has made it a priority to support our local businesses and building industry as they get back on their feet and build back better than before the pandemic,” Cr Johnston said.

“More investment in our region means construction jobs and opportunities for locals.

“Now, more than ever, our region needs these economic stimulus projects and council is continuing to the lead the way.”

&#x20;remains in place until December 2021 to stimulate jobs and complement State and Federal government programs also underway.
