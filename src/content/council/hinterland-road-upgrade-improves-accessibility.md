Brandenburg Road in Mooloolah Valley is being upgraded and widened to improve safety for all road users on the up-hill incline.

The works are located near the intersection of Viewland Drive and continue west for approximately 500 meters.

Many residents have been waiting for this work to take place. This is a great community asset and Council asks that residents be patient whilst this work is carried out.

### The works include:

*   The road widening on the up-hill side to provide a more uniform road width between 6 - 6.5m and to improve safety.
*   Installation of kerb and channel on the up-hill side to improve drainage.
*   Installation of three speed humps and additional signage to control traffic speed.
*   Minimum clearing of vegetation on the up-hill side may be required to accommodate the widening. A fauna spotter/catcher will be on site during any vegetation works and vegetation offset planting will be carried out off site to compensate for any loss.

Brandenburg Road widening works starting.

### Change to traffic

Brandenburg Road will be open for local traffic only throughout construction.

There will be delays at the construction site which will be under traffic control. Temporary closures will occur from time to time.

Traffic east and west of the temporarily closed section will need to take the detour route such as Landsborough Maleny Road – Gympie Street North – Tunnel Ridge Road – Connection Road.

Work started in February and is expected to be completed by mid-April 2023, weather and site conditions permitting.
