A major milestone was reached in Nambour on Friday 14 May with community members turning out to celebrate the official opening of the Nambour Heritage Tramway Depot. 

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was pleased to help provide a rich historical experience in Nambour.

“This heritage-listed tramline provides Nambour with a point of difference, it will help drive tourism and importantly support our local economy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Nambour’s newest attraction is the result of many years of community effort to get the tramway on track.

“It builds on council’s strong and continuing support for Nambour that will give a lot of confidence to local businesses and capitalise on the work done over many years to provide a vibrant and fulfilling future for Nambour and its community."

Officially opening the new Nambour Heritage Tramway Depot, Ted O’Brien MP, Federal Member for Fairfax, said the project was a huge milestone in the reimagining of the historical town.

“This project is a great example of what can be achieved when governments and the community have a dream and work together to achieve it,” Mr O’Brien said.

“We’ve brought this attraction back to life and we look forward to seeing it trundling through Nambour for many years to come.

“I can’t wait to get on board this piece of street theatre and travel along the beautiful streets of Nambour.”

The terminus project, which includes an information centre, has been funded by the Federal Government, the Sunshine Coast Council, and the Nambour Tramway Company (TNT Co), with contributions from the local community including a generous donation from philanthropists Roy and Nola Thompson.

Mr O’Brien secured half a million dollars of Federal funds, awarded through the National Stronger Regions Fund, to add to the $1.1 million raised by TNT Co and the $2.6 million contributed by the Sunshine Coast Council.

Greg Rogerson, Chairman of the Nambour Tramway Company said he's delighted to finally be able to host the Official Opening of the Terminus building and give people their first glimpse of the Tram design.

“Almost all the labour and materials for the terminus build were from Sunshine Coast businesses and now we are delighted to announce that the tram will also be built right here on the Sunshine Coast,” Mr Rogerson said. 

The special event also revealed the new design of a modern, solar powered battery operated tram to be designed and built on the Sunshine Coast.Until the battery-powered tram is built, the terminus will remain home to the 1968 Petrie Locomotive which was gifted to The Nambour Tramway Co by Bundaberg Sugar in 2014, for locals and visitors to enjoy.

The battery-powered tram will run between Nambour Mill Village Shopping Centre to the southern end of Quota Park between Repco and Aldi, and along Mill and Howard Streets.

The tram and terminus are expected to be operational by the end of the year.
