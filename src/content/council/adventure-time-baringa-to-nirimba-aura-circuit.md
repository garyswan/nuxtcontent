An easy 7.2km walk, ride or run for the active family throughout the newly built pathway and cycleway.

## Suitability

This circuit is ideal for the whole family, including your dog on a lead. Make sure though to bring water and a hat.

## Highlights

Start your journey at Baringa’s centre, head south via the pathway or cycleway along Aura Boulevard.

Along the way you will experience clear views of the Glasshouse Mountains.

Once you reach Aura central take a break at the cute little coffee shop easily located next to the pathway. Continue your journey back and you will find a new playground with undercover picnic areas, toilet facilities and a drinking fountain.
