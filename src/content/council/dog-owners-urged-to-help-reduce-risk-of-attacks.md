Responsible dog ownership will be highlighted as Sunshine Coast Council launches its annual inspection program.

The program relates to dogs that are “regulated’’ under the State legislation.

The annual audit of properties where a regulated dog is kept, ensures animal owners are doing the right thing by their community to reduce potential risks.

Officers will audit premises where regulated dogs are being kept to ensure they are being kept in line with the applicable conditions. These relate to containment, tags, signage, registration, collars and microchips.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said the compliance audits ensured council was doing what it could to keep the community safe.

“There are risks associated with regulated dogs, but we want the community to have peace in knowing we’re working to ensure these dogs are being properly contained and looked after,” Cr Johnston said.

“Owning any dog comes with serious responsibilities and that is increased for owners of regulated dogs.”

Under the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008, there are three regulated dog categories - declared dangerous, declared menacing and restricted.

During annual regulated dog inspection programs, council’s Response Services team focuses on working with dog owners to ensure they meet the requirements of keeping a regulated dog.

This includes improving advice and recommendations around creating child proof fences and repairing old containments where there are signs of wear and tear.

Council is committed to promoting community safety and educating the community on how to be a responsible pet owner through various education programs.

The next 12 month program was approved by council at the October Ordinary Meeting (October 27) and is due to start on November 14.

The Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008 requires local governments to manage regulated dogs within their boundaries.

**Regulated dog facts:**

**Dangerous**

A dangerous dog declaration may be made for a dog if the dog:

*   has seriously attacked someone, or another animal
*   has acted in a way that causes fear to someone, or another animal
*   may – in the opinion of an authorised person – seriously attack someone, or another animal, or
*   may act in a way that causes fear to someone, or another animal.

**Menacing**

A menacing dog declaration may be made for a dog if it behaved in a way defined as 'dangerous', except that the attack was not serious.

**Restricted**

The following breeds of dogs are restricted:

*   American Pit Bull Terriers
*   Dogo Argentino
*   Fila Brasileiro
*   Japanese Tosa.

**Note:** A restricted breed requires a restricted dog permit from council.
