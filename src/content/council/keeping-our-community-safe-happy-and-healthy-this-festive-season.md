Everyone deserves a safe and happy Sunshine Coast summer, exploring and enjoying all our healthy, smart and creative region has to offer.  

So, whether you’re a long time local, new resident or a visitor, be sure to keep your wellbeing and the wellbeing of our community front of mind these holidays.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson is calling on everyone to remain COVID-19 vigilant during the festive season.

“We want Christmas and the holidays to remain the most wonderful time of year, so I urge you, if you haven’t had your COVID-19 vaccination, there is no better time,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Vaccination is our ticket to a safer future, our best defence in the fight against COVID-19.

“Please remember to have a booster dose when advised and don’t forget about personal hygiene basics.

“Stay home if you are sick, get tested if you have any COVID-19 symptoms, stay 1.5 metres away from other people, wash your hands often with soap and water or hand sanitiser, and sneeze or cough into your arm or a tissue. Then put the tissue in the bin.

“Wear a face mask when you are not able to keep 1.5 metres away from other people or when mandatory face masks are required.”

Mayor Jamieson said with borders now open, and an influx of holidaymakers on the Sunshine Coast, it was important to be kind and considerate to others.

“Who wouldn’t want to visit our Sunshine Coast? From to the coast to the hinterland, and everywhere in between our region boasts an abundance of natural beauty and unique attractions.

“That’s exactly why people flock here, so please plan ahead and be patient during these busy periods.

“Please make our visitors feel welcome, this will be a very special Christmas for so many who are finally spending it with loved ones they had been separated from.

“Remember to continue to check-in. This is vital information for our contact tracers, and ensure you have proof of your COVID-19 vaccination available if required.

“Our community has done a remarkable job of uniting to protect each other during the pandemic and I am confident we can continue this into the new year and beyond.”

Queensland Police Service Sunshine Coast District Officer Superintendent Craig Hawkins said it was important the community were respectful toward each other during the festive season.

“The holidays are very busy, so if you’re on the roads, please be patient and courteous, and take breaks,” Superintendent Hawkins said.

“Likewise, retail, hospitality, and tourist attractions here on the Sunshine Coast will be busy, keep in mind that many businesses will also be required to comply with the Queensland Government’s Public Health measures.

“We expect everyone to show these businesses respect, there is no excuse for bad behaviour toward them or any other patrons.”
