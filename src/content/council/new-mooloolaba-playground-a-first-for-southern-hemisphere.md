Works are now underway to install a one-of-a-kind children’s adventure playground in the heart of Mooloolaba as part of Sunshine Coast Council’s Stage 1, Northern Parkland works.

This exciting new family friendly play space is the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere, especially designed for children of all ages and abilities.

It follows the successful opening of the new [boardwalk and viewing platform](https://oursc.com.au/community/lets-stroll-down-the-boardwalk-in-mooloolaba)
&#x20;at the Mooloolaba foreshore in November 2021.

The adventure playground, which was designed in collaboration with Queensland’s Urban Play, KOMPAN Design Studio and Fleetwood Urban, features three main elements including a multidimensional climbing net, large swing set and Pandanus Play Towers.

Two of the three playground elements are expected to open in early April, including the climbing net and swing set, ready for the peak Easter holiday period.

The unique climbing net experience will challenge and develop children’s motor skills, build muscle strength, courage and social skills.

The 360-degree design of the net allows people of all abilities to climb onto or play underneath the net and offers inclusive sensory ground-level activities.

The final element, the Pandanus Play Towers, is due to open by mid-June, weather and site conditions permitting.

Shade sails will be installed over the swing set and lower elements of the play towers for sun safety.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the new playground would deliver major economic benefit to Mooloolaba and further position the iconic foreshore as a prime destination for locals and visitors.

“This will be one of the most incredible playgrounds in our region and I am thrilled our community will be able to enjoy early access to the climbing net and swings prior to the official opening of the entire Stage 1 Northern Parkland mid-year”, Cr Natoli said.

“The adventure playground has been designed to fit within the natural terrain and will be positioned at the southern section of the Stage 1 Northern Parkland area, near the new sheltered barbecue facility, public amenities building and the coastal pathway.

“This one-of-a-kind playground has been especially created for our Mooloolaba Foreshore.

“Stage 1 includes over 10,000 new plants and 120 trees, including palms native to the Sunshine Coast.”

The adventure playground is surrounded by new open grass space to throw out a picnic rug or play ball, extensive garden beds and revegetation, accessible boardwalk and pathways – all with the vantage of Mooloolaba’s famous ocean views.

The new adventure playground is an outcome of community consultation from the [2015 Place Making Mooloolaba Master Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Place-Making-Mooloolaba-Master-Plan)
. 

The complete Stage 1 Northern Parkland will be officially unveiled with an exciting community event later this year.

**Stage 1 of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation includes:**

*   A new viewing platform with seating at the Alex Bluff Foreshore Park **– now open!**
*   An accessible boardwalk linking Alexandra Headland and Mooloolaba **– now open!**
*   Two new sets of stairs linking Mooloolaba Esplanade to the parkland and beach – **one** **now open!**
*   Open space for the community to come together and connect with nature.
*   Children’s adventure playground.
*   A sheltered barbecue area and public amenities.
*   More than 120 new trees and more than 10,000 new shrubs and groundcovers as well as removal of weed species.

The new infrastructure is part of the greater Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation project which will increase public beachfront parkland by 40 per cent and include new community spaces and amenities, all of which aim to enhance and celebrate the natural Sunshine Coast way of life.

The Queensland Government has invested $4.6 million into Stage 1 through the $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package for south east Queensland councils to stimulate economies and support jobs. Sunshine Coast Council has committed $11.5 million towards Stage 1 and is proud to have local firms deliver this new parkland precinct.
