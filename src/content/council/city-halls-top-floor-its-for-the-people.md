Sunshine Coast City Hall’s top floor, offering views from the hinterland to the coastline, will be for the people.

Council, at today’s (December 9) Ordinary Meeting, recognised the importance of connecting the community with the civic building, and agreed to retain Level 9 for civic and community purposes, rather than lease it out for commercial operations.

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas said the building, now under construction, would be part of Maroochydore’s community heart.

“Council has acknowledged the importance of community access to, engagement in, and connection with, its city hall and the position and nature of this level of the building sees it well-placed to provide that opportunity,” Ms Thomas said.

“There is increasing demand for a range of community spaces and the top level of city hall will assist in responding to that need.

"We will see it used for council hosted and sponsored events, citizenship ceremonies and community engagement workshops and it will be available for hire for specified community events.

“We also envisage that Level 9 will be an important asset for the significant range of delegations, workshops and activities to prepare for and deliver the Brisbane 2032 Summer Olympics.

“It has also been suggested that Level 9 be used to display and present exhibition themes portraying our natural and social history, environment, sustainability and heritage, arts and culture and we are keen to explore those opportunities.”

While yet to be finalised, the fitout design may include catering bump-in facilities, audio visual, information technology and a dividing wall system to allow for multiple uses.

Ms Thomas said including community use within city hall would also activate the broader Maroochydore City Centre.

Council also agreed to retain Level 8 for council operations, a space for cross-group teams working on key projects such as the New Planning Scheme and creating short term (one to three year) collaboration, start-up, innovation and project spaces potentially in cooperation with community and business partners.

“This is a growing area of interest and opportunity and is consistent with council’s key community, economic and environment and liveability strategies and council’s healthy, smart and creative ambitions,” Ms Thomas said.

Sunshine Coast City Hall’s construction is expected to be completed late 2022.

**The project**

Sunshine Coast City Hall will be located at the corner of South Sea Islander Way and First Avenue, Maroochydore. It will include customer contact, council chamber, retail spaces and office accommodation for approximately 700 council staff from late 2022.

Visit the project web page at [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)
&#x20;or phone 5475 7272 for more information.

**The building**

The key building parameters endorsed by council for the Maroochydore Administration Building are:

*   Approximate Nett Lettable Area of 9,600m2
*   Approximate Gross Building Area of 21,500m2
*   10 levels and rooftop
*   156 car parking spaces
*   5 star National Australian Built Environment Energy Rating System rating target
*   5 star Green Star rating target
*   Regional A grade commercial building
*   Complementary commercial/retail uses

**The concept design**

The design is inspired by the landscape of the Sunshine Coast - our deep connection to the hinterland, our mountain ranges and our coastal plains.

The Maroochydore Administration Building will be bordered by the laneways of the City Centre, South Sea Islander Way and First Avenue. Retail and dining opportunities will be offered at the Ground Floor and public art and landscaping will create attractive spaces to link the Maroochydore Administration Building with its surroundings.
