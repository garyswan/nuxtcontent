Sunshine Coast Council has revealed its new-look [Have Your Say](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/?utm_source=Corporate&utm_medium=Spotlights&utm_campaign=Have%20your%20say&utm_term=Have%20your%20say)
&#x20;platform - a central and freshly designed portal created to spark innovative ideas in an easy-to-navigate format.  

Community members are encouraged to register online to receive important community consultation updates, and for those who are already subscribed to also review and update their profiles and preferences.

At one quick glance, people can see the projects open for community consultation, such as Eumundi Placemaking and the Woombye street design project.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said meaningful community engagement was an essential and valuable input in future council projects, decision-making and outcomes for our region.

“Every voice in our region has value, and we genuinely encourage you to contribute your ideas and submit feedback on matters that affect you and your community,” Cr Law said.

“Our refreshed Have Your Say platform has some really nifty tools to capture vital community feedback.

“You can submit stories and experiences quickly and easily and information is presented in an easy to understand format.

“The upgraded site also provides a mapping tool which collects geographic-based feedback and council can conduct polls and use intuitive forms to gather input.

“Jump onto the platform today, take a look and register, or update your details as it will only take a moment.

“This is a core action of our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;which aims to connect and engage with our community so together we thrive, and a key deliverable of council’s excellence in engagement approach.”   

He said the online tool was part of a suite of consultation options that would continue to be provided by council including drop-in sessions, stakeholder meetings, phone calls, written feedback and more.

USC Pro Vice-Chancellor (Engagement) Professor Joanne Scott said the initiative would help raise awareness of key research and engagement projects involving the Council and the University.

 “The Sunshine Coast Council and USC’s ongoing Regional Partnership Agreement encourages our researchers and academics to collaborate on work that boosts the sustainability of our region,” Professor Scott said.

“We look forward to seeing the public feedback and discussions stimulated by this interactive online platform.”
