Where would you like to exercise and walk your pooch off-leash in Mapleton? That’s the question Divisional Councillor David Law is asking the Mapleton community this month.

“Mapleton residents love their furry companions,” Cr Law said.

“Council’s records show that there is one dog registered for every seven people.

“This demonstrates the need for a dog off-leash facility in the local area considering the nearest unfenced dog off-leash area is Petrie Park, Nambour and the nearest fenced facility is at Federation Park, Palmwoods.

“With this in mind, I’m pleased to say, following community feedback received in 2019, council has identified three potential sites for a dog off-leash area and has developed concept designs for each location.

“Two of the proposed sites are located within Mapleton Lilyponds Park on Delicia Road. Option one is an unfenced dog off-leash area during specified times and the second option, is a fenced dog off-leash area.

“The third option is located at Mapleton Fire Brigade Park on Obi Obi Road and would also be a fenced dog off-leash area.

“Council values the input of residents and is seeking feedback so all relevant opinions are considered in the decision-making process.

“I encourage everyone to review each [concept design](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mapleton-dog-off-leash-area)
, select your preferred dog off-leash site and provide your feedback on the design options via an online [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B8XB32W)
.

“I am looking forward to receiving your feedback and taking this community project to the next stage.”

All feedback received from the community will inform council’s decision to proceed with a detailed design of a dedicated dog off-leash area, at the preferred location. Council is committed to keeping the community informed on the project as it progresses.

The community is encouraged to share their thoughts and ideas by visiting council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mapleton-dog-off-leash-area)
&#x20;before 5pm, Wednesday 24 March.

Visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Animals-and-Pets/Dog-Parks-and-Off-Leash-Areas)
