The latest section of Coastal Pathway near Palkana Park, Warana is open to the community to enjoy a walk, ride, run, scoot or skate alongside the open beach and tea trees.

Stage 2 of the Coastal Pathway works adds an extra kilometre to the Coastal Pathway Network, which spans 73-kilometre-long route from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north. 

The highlight of this section between Palkana Wetland and Beach Access 234  is the raised boardwalk allowing users to travel through a seasonal tea tree wetland. 

The section offers a chance for our community to hear the site come to life during frog mating season or explode with butterflies at various times of the year. 

The Palkana stage consists of over 100m of raised boardwalk linking the Coastal Path to the north and south. 

Bush revegetation works are ongoing with the management of weeds and assisted generation of native vegetation. 

The long-term bush regeneration and offset planting is an important part of the project which has seen another 290 trees into the area in addition to 600 plants and trees already installed as part of this stage of works.

**WHAT’S NEXT?**

The project team is progressing the design for the next stage of works which in time will link up with the existing network near Kawana Surf club. 

A wayfinding signage project for the Bokarina / Warana Coastal Path is also underway with installation scheduled for this new financial year.

*The pathway is being completed in partnership with Council and the Department of Transport and Main Road’s Cycle Network Local Government Grants Program.*
