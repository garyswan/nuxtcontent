As part of Create Caloundra students have learnt about Sunshine Coast Council planning projects and turned old trash into treasure at our Caloundra Administration Building.

Caloundra City Private School Year 8 students have transformed household resources, which often get thrown away, into dazzling hangings for our community.

The art workshop is part of raising awareness about the Caloundra Community + Creative Hub to get our youngest minds thinking about art, creativity and the environment.

**WHAT IS CREATE CALOUNDRA?**

The proposed hub seeks to be a public space precinct connecting The Events Centre, new district library, Caloundra Regional Gallery and town square through to Bulcock Beach.The Caloundra Community + Creative hub will be your future place for arts, community and creativity.
