In 1954, the newly crowned Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia.

Queensland was included in the itinerary and seven million people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty and Prince Phillip.

To acknowledge the unwavering devotion and service of Her Majesty to the Commonwealth, a series of displays and stories are being shared at Sunshine Coast museums and as on-line exhibitions.

Find these throughout June at

*   Landsborough Museum
*   Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct
*   Nambour Museum
*   Yandina Historic House and Museum
*   Heritage Library

## *"As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all; and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. - The Queen's Accession Day message."*
