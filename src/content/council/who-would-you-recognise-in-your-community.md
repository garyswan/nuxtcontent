We all know someone who deserves a big pat on the back for the work they do for others — and now is the time to bring them out of the shadows and celebrate all their efforts.

Nominations are open for the 2023 Sunshine Coast Australia Day Awards, which give our community the chance to say ‘thank you’ to those who go the extra mile.

The awards recognise the fundraisers, the community support groups, the volunteers and the organisations who deliver time and time again for our region.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the awards were about shining the spotlight on our local heroes.

“Our current 2022 recipients are outstanding. They continue to inspire and deliver outcomes for their communities across a raft of areas from tackling homelessness to digging deeply for the environment,” Mayor Jamieson said.

2022 Sunshine Coast Australia Day recipients

“Now, we’re again on the hunt for nominees across seven categories, from creative and sport and recreation to environment.

“We’re also looking for our next citizen, senior citizen and young citizen of the year, as well as the community group or organisation making a positive difference to our community.

“I encourage everyone to think about who has made a difference to their life or the lives of those around them and nominate them for an award.
