The Sunshine Coast is not only home to migratory shorebirds, but also to resident shorebirds. Resident shorebirds donâ€™t migrate to breed, instead they nest on our beaches and rocky headlands.

Laying eggs and raising chicks on our open beaches makes them particularly vulnerable to predation from wild and domestic animals.

As with all shorebirds, share our shores and keep your distance.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
