Community groups around Beerwah will soon have a new location to get together, with construction officially getting underway on the new Beerwah Community Meeting Place.

The new facility is being constructed by Sunshine Coast Council thanks to funding from the Palaszczuk Government’s Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package.

Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt welcomed news that construction had now started.

“This new facility is a fantastic opportunity in our community, helping to create a space for locals to come together,” Mr Hunt said.

“The Beerwah Community Meeting place will be a real asset for our community and by investing in it we’re investing in our community.

“Critically the construction of this facility with deliver a number of high quality construction jobs for locals, helping to drive the southern Sunshine Coast’s economic recovery.

Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said it was projects like this that were driving Queensland’s economic recovery.

“By investing in our communities up and down Queensland we’re getting locals back to work and rebuilding after the COVID pandemic,” Ms Boyd said.

“Palaszczuk Government’s Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package in particular has been delivering for communities like Beerwah.”

“In fact, across South East Queensland, the program will create or support more than 1,500 jobs, through 63 individual projects.

“Sunshine Coast Council has received $6.5 million from the program to help deliver four projects that the council estimates will support or create more than 600 jobs.”

When completed, the Beerwah Community Meeting Place will include a range of flexible meeting rooms, an outdoor meeting room and ‘green’ arcade, and small kitchenette.

Sunshine Coast Council Deputy Mayor Rick Baberowski joined Ms Boyd for the start of construction.

“Our community groups have been struggling with the existing one small space or alternative large hall for years, so they will now have many more choices and I’m sure will put the building to good use,” Deputy Mayor Baberowski said.

“Our dedicated volunteers and community champions do so much for so many and this new space will give them access to a comfortable and modern facility to work from.

“This is the essential fourth element to this popular precinct now comprising of a library, hall, meeting space and parklands and I can’t wait to celebrate the opening in a few months’ time.”

Construction is expected to be finished by late June 2021.
