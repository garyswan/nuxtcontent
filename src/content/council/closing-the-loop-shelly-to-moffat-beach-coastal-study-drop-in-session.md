Between 2021 and 2022 a detailed study of the coastal strip from the southern end of Shelly Beach northward to Tooway Lake took place.

We asked our community what they love about this section of coastline to help guide our management of it into the future.

Their feedback and a lot of research has gone into this study, and we are ready to present the outcomes.

### Come along to a drop in INFORMATION SESSION to learn more.

**Date:** Saturday April 22, 2023

**Time:** Drop in anytime between 9am and 1pm
