The amazing new Caloundra District Library, priority road safety projects and numerous parks and gardens improvements are just some of the key features in the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget for Division 2. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said he was confident the Division 2 community would share his excitement about the start of the new Caloundra District Library project.\
“This will be a great cultural facility and is also the first new library for the Sunshine Coast Local Government area in more than 20 years, with $5.3 million allocated towards initial construction costs,” Cr Landsberg said.\
“The safety of our Sunshine Coast residents and visitors continues to be a priority in council’s 2022–23 budget with more than $4.5 million allocated to transportation capital works in Division 2 alone.

“This funding includes the upgrade of a number of key Division 2 intersections such as the $1.1 million upgrade to the Queen Street and Bower Street intersection – an important project that has prioritised the safety of students and road users around Caloundra State High School.\
“Another $456,000 will be invested in constructing pathways on Queen Street near Caloundra State School and Caloundra State High School.”\
As part of council’s commitment to improving access into the Caloundra CBD and surrounding destinations through the ongoing Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade project, $888,000 has been allocated to the Oval Avenue and Gosling Street Upgrade (Section 1) for detailed design.\
Council will also contribute $500,000 towards the detailed design development of the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ Nicklin Way/Third Avenue Extension, Section 2 of the Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade project.\
“To help us continue to enjoy the great coastal facilities in Division 2, more than $1.4 million has been allocated to parks and gardens projects and includes the $425,000 Dicky Beach interpretive area celebrating the SS Dicky; and a variety of renewal and refurbishments of existing infrastructure such as swings, tables, seats, signage and playgrounds,” Cr Landsberg said.\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
