The Easter bunny may need to be extra careful delivering goodies this long weekend, with wet weather including possible heavy rainfall, strong winds and hazardous surf conditions forecast.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson is urging both the Easter bunny and community members to be prepared in the event of significant and unpredictable storms.

“As we’ve seen many times before, powerful storm cells can result in power outages, road closures, fallen trees and vegetation damage,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“A severe storm can have a big impact on your life, so please pay close attention to the Bureau of Meteorology this long weekend and always put safety first.”

Mayor Jamieson encouraged everyone to ensure their households or businesses were prepared before the next storm hits and avoid unnecessary travel if you don’t need to be on the road during severe weather.

“Please have plans in place to cope with the unexpected. No matter how accustomed to storm season you may feel – don’t become complacent.”

Parents and guardians are urged to be aware of where their children are, especially at the beach and everyone is reminded not to play in flood waters.

Visit council’s Disaster Hub website [disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;to find the latest updates, practical resources and what to do before, during and after a storm or emergency.

**Tips during the storm season to help minimise the damage on your home and keep your household safe:**

*   Trim trees and branches close to the house, but call a professional tree trimmer if they’re near powerlines.
*   Secure loose items in your backyard.
*   Clear gutters, downpipes and drains.
*   Check your roof regularly to ensure it’s in good condition.
*   Make sure all shades, sails and awnings are fitted properly.
*   Get your insurance up-to-date and check your policy inclusions.
*   Identify the safest room in the house to shelter during a storm.
*   Identify a safe place to evacuate to should a storm surge or flood threaten your home.
*   Ensure you know how to safely turn off your power, water and gas.
*   Check your emergency kit is up-to-date with water containers, a barbecue or another gas or coal cooking appliance.
*   Make sure your pet’s registration and tags are current.
*   Stock up on food, water and medicine for your pets.
*   Tune into warnings.

Households and businesses should also check to see if they require a generator. Business owners can find more information about preparing for emergencies by visiting council’s Disaster Hub website [disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)
.

**When a severe weather warning or storm alert has been issued for the Sunshine Coast, ensure you gain as much information as possible to help you prepare and protect your household and home:**

*   Tune in to the local radio and TV station for updates. (ABC 90.3 FM SUNSHINE COAST and 95.3 FM GYMPIE).

*   Log on to the Sunshine Coast Council’s Disaster Hub website:

    and reliable social media sources managed by council or emergency services.

*   Listen out for the Standard Emergency Warning Signal (SEWS) – this is the siren used at the beginning of storm warning announcements on radio and TV, for Emergency Alert messages on your landline and mobile phone, for warning sirens and announcements made by emergency services. 

**Pre-storm checklist:**

*   Secure outdoor furniture and gardening items.
*   Tape glass on exposed windows and secure all doors.
*   Park vehicles under cover or protect with secured tarpaulins or blankets.
*   Ensure your car has a full tank of fuel.
*   Turn off and unplug electrical items and turn off power, water and gas if instructed.
*   Ensure mobile phone batteries are fully charged.
*   Stay indoors as the storm approaches and ensure pets/farm animals are secured safely under shelter.
*   Store your important documents, medical prescriptions and valuables in a waterproof container in a secure location like your car boot.
*   Ensure that every household member knows about warnings and advice.

**Post-storm checklist:**

*   Check on neighbours and friends who may need special assistance.
*   Don’t go exploring.
*   Act quickly on advice given by emergency services.
