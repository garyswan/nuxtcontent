Community consultation for a new Peregian Springs Community Centre, $2.4 million to seal Zgrajewski Road, Yandina Creek, and a new amenities building for Jack Morgan Park, Coolum are just some of the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 9.

Divisional councillor Maria Suarez said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future across the region.

“I’m pleased to be able to progress projects which have been on the community wish list for some time now,” Cr Suarez said.

“Road improvements and sealing of unsealed roads remains a priority. The $500,000 sealing of Oyster Bank Road, Bli Bli and $300,000 to improve the safety and upgrade the Coolum Sports intersection at David Low Way, Coolum are also welcomed investments.

“A missing link of the coastal pathway at Coolum Beach between Lions Park and Norrie Job Park will be built as well as a new amenity block at Jack Morgan Park.

“Planning for a new community park at our Blue Heart at Yandina will begin as well as upgrades to other playground and fitness equipment at Cordellia Street Park Playground, Coolum Beach and Grove Park, Mornington Crescent, Peregian Springs.

“A significant investment is taking place in securing our future waste and recycling processing capacity, with construction of a new Materials Recovery Facility and expansion of the Nambour Landfill and resource recovery facility at Bli Bli.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
