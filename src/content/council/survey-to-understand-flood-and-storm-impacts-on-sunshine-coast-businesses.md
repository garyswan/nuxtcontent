Sunshine Coast Council continues to work closely with all levels of government, emergency and community agencies to support our community as the region navigates the impacts of the recent significant weather and flooding events.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said he understood the impact the weather event has had on local businesses.

“Council is supporting and advocating for our local business community to ensure we can bounce back as a region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our local businesses are the ones employing our friends and family, they help shape our local communities and are the economic backbone of our region.

“They need all the support they can get and we encourage the community to buy and support local businesses wherever possible.”

The Queensland Government’s Department of Employment, Small Business and Training (DESBT) would like to connect with business owners impacted by recent rainfall and flooding to identify what help they need during this challenging time. 

“It is important that council shares this information with our business community so that our local businesses can get the support they need to recover and get back on track quickly,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We support the Queensland Government’s Natural Disaster Business Survey which will help the Department understand the impact of rainfall and flooding on businesses on the Sunshine Coast and throughout South East Queensland, Maryborough and the Fraser Coast and will inform the ongoing assistance required.

“We encourage local businesses to complete this short survey to ensure the Sunshine Coast has a strong voice and appropriate levels of assistance can be provided for them to support their recovery.  

This survey will remain open as long as required to enable time for impacted businesses to respond.

Mayor Jamieson also welcomed the Queensland Government announcement that funding is now available for Sunshine Coast businesses who have been affected by the recent weather events.

An initial $558.5 million, jointly funded by the Australian and Queensland governments will be provided to support communities in need.

Demand driven grants of up to $75,000 for primary producers, up to $50,000 for affected small businesses and not-for-profit organisations, and $20,000 for sporting and community clubs and associations will be available through Queensland Government agencies to help flood-affected communities get back on their feet. Find out more information about these grants [here](https://www.qrida.qld.gov.au/)
.

In addition, the Queensland Government Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is seeking input from agricultural businesses and producers by completing the DAF Natural Disaster Impact Survey. The survey aims to gain a better understanding of the extent of the recent natural disaster has had on this sector.
