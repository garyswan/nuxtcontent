High quality open space that supports active and healthy communities is a key priority for Sunshine Coast Council.

Council is investigating the community’s interest in a Dog Exercise Area (DEA) in Yandina.

### Six sites have been identified as suitable:

1.Wonga Park (Fenced)

2.Tea Tree Park 1 (Fenced)

3.Tea Tree Park 2 (Fenced)

4.Stevens Street Reserve (Fenced)

5.Christina Low Park (Unfenced)

6.Koongalba Street Park (Unfenced)

Council invites you to have your say on the proposal of a DEA at Yandina by completing a short online survey before **June 2, 2023.**

[Click here for survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/yandina-dog-exercise-area)


Community feedback received during this engagement phase will help Council determine the community demand and best location for a dog exercise area at Yandina.

The construction of the proposed DEA has not been scheduled. If the community supports the project, it will be developed in stages subject to detailed design and funding availability in future financial years.
