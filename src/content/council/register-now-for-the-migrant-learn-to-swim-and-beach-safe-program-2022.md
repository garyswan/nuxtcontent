Sunshine Coast migrants wanting to make a splash can now register for a popular low-cost swim program designed to boost their confidence and safety skills in and around the water.

The Migrant Learn to Swim and Beach Safe program, run by Sunshine Coast Council and Royal Life Saving Society of Queensland, will run for seven weeks at Goodlife Community Centre, Buderim, and Nambour Aquatic Centre, plus Bulcock Beach from March 12, 2022.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said it was great to see the program back for another year.

“Within our region, the water is a way of life, so it is vital that we are all safe and familiar at the pool and beach,” Cr Law said.

“Council is committed to promoting beach and water safety across the Sunshine Coast, with the Migrant Learn to Swim and Beach Safe program now in its fourth year.

“This program is a great opportunity for participants to learn water safety, make social connections and engage in outdoor exercise which aligns strongly with council’s vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region, healthy, smart, creative.

“The program is extremely popular, and I am grateful for the hard work of all the participants, instructors and organisers.”

Migrant Learn to Swim participant Abdalla Mohamed said the program has been great for his water confidence.

“I joined the program because I didn’t know how to swim, and I was afraid going into the water,” Mr Mohamed said.

“I was frightened at the start and at my first lesson, but I was able to overcome my fear and can now swim.

“I met a few people in the program that I am still friends with now and the team were very lovely and very helpful. I am hoping to continue swimming classes with them and build on my skills.”

Royal Life Saving Queensland Executive Director Paul Barry said the program and other learn-to-swim programs can save lives.

“In Queensland, it is especially important to ensure that our community is confident in and around the water,” Mr Barry said.

“The program is designed for participants with limited experience with swimming and I encourage migrants to register now and give it a go.”

“It’s also very important that we are all equipped with beach safety and survival skills. If the community has any questions or concerns, just ask a lifeguard and remember to swim between the red and yellow flags.”

**KEY DATES:**

*   **Welcome Session**: 11am-noon on Saturday, March 12 at Nambour Aquatic Centre, 31 Petrie Park Rd, Nambour, (mixed sessions) and Goodlife Community Centre, 100 Buderim Pines Drive, Buderim (women’s only and mixed sessions)
