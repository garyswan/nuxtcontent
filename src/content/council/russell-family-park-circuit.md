Have you been to Russel Family Park lately? Get set for a fun, healthy and active adventure for the whole family! 

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers, prams and wheelchairs and recreational cyclists of all age-groups. It’s an easy grade circuit.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Wheelchair and grand-folk friendly, Russell Family Park in Montville is just that. Perfect to stroll off all the coffee and cake and other delectables from Montville’s many main street cafés with lots of great interweaving pathways. Or take a seat and watch the ducks on the lake or your kids in the playground.

This newly upgraded 7.5 ha park features a 10 metre super slide, nature playscape, butterfly eclipse climbing tower along with a windmill, two lakes with signed heritage walking paths and large grassy hills for children to safely roll down. At the northern end is a rainforest and a flying fox that even adults can enjoy. 

At certain times of year you can enjoy flowering trees. At other times, there are lots of ferns and water plants to admire.

Public amenities and BBQ facilities are also available.

**AFTERWARDS**\
Take a picnic or BBQ supplies and enjoy a relaxed lunch in the park or stroll through Montville’s main street and revive yourself at one of the many establishments. For some more excitement head to Kondalilla Falls, only 5 mins drive away.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Head to the Montville Visitor Information Centre on Main St, just past Western Avenue. At the information centre there is an off-street car park. Walk or cycle though the carpark and you will find the park.
