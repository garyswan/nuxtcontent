Creating solutions to end poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring people enjoy peace and prosperity will be the motivation for more than 100 designers, developers, students and creatives who will gather at the Sunshine Coast’s seventh annual Techstars Startup Weekend (August 5-7).

This boot camp for big ideas will run for 54 action packed hours of hands-on entrepreneurship, giving innovators a framework and mentorship to transform their bright ideas into reality, with team formation, user research, prototyping and pitching to investors.

For the first time, the Startup Weekend will focus on the United Nations [Sustainable Dev](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) [elopment Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)
.

Sunshine Coast Council is proudly sponsoring the Sustainable Cities and Communities category.

Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said this event was an exciting and immersive foray into the world of entrepreneurship.

“Attendees will learn to think, work and build their own startup in a race to the finish line,” Cr Landsberg said.  

“This is an opportunity for innovators to link up with the very best mentors, investors, co-founders and sponsors to teach them how to get more done faster and maybe even launch that business idea they’ve been dreaming of.”

Tim Hall from the local innovative startup venture, Greaseboss, will be a judge at the event.

Greaseboss is a Sunshine Coast based success story which evolved from a similar Startup Weekend event in 2017. The business has now grown to achieve global recognition in its field.

The boot camp culminates with the pitch night on Sunday. The participants will then have the opportunity to further refine their offering with the support of local entrepreneurship network Silicon Coast and participate in the Social Enterprise World Forum in Brisbane in September.
