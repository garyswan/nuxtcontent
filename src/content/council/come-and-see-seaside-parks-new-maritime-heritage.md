The construction fencing has come down on part of the second stage of the [Dicky Beach Precinct Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Dicky-Beach-Precinct-Plan)
.

The Stage 1 works included the S.S. Dicky propellor relocation, new and improved community facilities such as the public amenities and skate park, connecting pathways, a new picnic shelter and beach showers.

The second stage of works now compliment the first with connecting pathways, improved beach access, custom furniture and seating which will encourage locals and visitors to grab a spot of lunch from the nearby shops, or just spend time outdoors.

The space provides a welcoming experience for people of all ages and abilities.

The SS Dicky’s wreck’s significance to the local area will soon be on display through interpretive elements and ship pieces featured on a viewing deck which has direct line of sight to the location of the S.S. Dicky beach grounding. Watch this space!
