Horizon Festival, the Sunshine Coast’s premier arts and cultural celebration, is back in 2021, with ten inspirational days and nights of music, visual art, theatre, dance, film, spoken word, comedy and much more.

The iconic festival runs from Friday 27 August to Sunday 5 September bringing together local and national artists to offer vibrant, immersive and entertaining experiences for all ages.

The full program and tickets are now available at [www.horizonfestival.com.au](http://www.horizonfestival.com.au)


Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the festival was an exciting celebration of the arts.

“Horizon is a great example of Sunshine Coast Council and our community working together to create a festival that pushes boundaries and surprises and delights all in attendance,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our region’s arts and cultural sector is thriving and, in its sixth year, Horizon Festival is well on its way to becoming a cultural highlight on the national arts calendar.”

Horizon Festival Artistic Director Dr Lynne Bradleysaid this year’s festival shone a spotlight on the extraordinary talents of our local Sunshine Coast and Queensland-based artists.

“The all-Queensland line-up offers local audiences and visitors to the Coast the chance to experience a high quality and accessible artistic program, set against the spectacular backdrop of the region,” Dr Bradley said.

“The natural environment and issues such as climate change feature throughout the program, with many projects inspired by, and set within, this region’s very special landscape including Lake Baroon, Glass House Mountains, Chambers Island and Happy Valley. 

“Deeply connected to Country and community, local Kabi Kabi (Gubbi Gubbi) and Jinibara artists are central to this year’s festival.

“The First Nations’ program includes the much-celebrated ceremonial performance, *Dawn Awakening,* at Stumers Creek on Sunday 5 September, large-scale outdoor visual arts projections, *Kabi Kabi Connections,* and an array of rich cultural offerings throughout the region."

This year, Horizon Festival cranks the lever on excitement with a festival hub like no other.

The Wonderland Spiegeltent will take centre-stage overlooking the water at Cotton Tree Park, bringing with it a program of world-class cabaret, comedy, circus, dance and theatre.

Never-before seen on the Coast, the Wonderland Spiegeltent, built in the 1920s, is an opulent travelling pavilion boasting ballooning velvet canopies, ornate stained-glass windows and an intimate interior that will charm and delight audiences.

The Spiegeltent program will host a hugely diverse range of shows from the adults-only *Club Briefs* by Briefs Factory International and stand-up comedy *Black Out* featuring Ydinji comedian Steph Tisdell and friends, to *Circus Wonderland - A Mermaid’s Tale*, a heart-warming circus show for the whole family.

Sunshine Coast dance gladiators will battle it out on the Wonderland Spiegeltent stage in an over-the-top explosion of sequins, sweat and spandex, in *Common People Dance Eisteddfod*.

Dr Bradley said the team came together in March and, over the next few months, are rehearsing ’80s-inspired dance routines that pay homage to the Rock Eisteddfods of decades past.

*“Common People Dance Eisteddfod* is an amazing project hailing from Brisbane that brings people of all ages and abilities together through dance and performance. *Common People* will be a highlight of the program and really speaks to our commitment to creating opportunities for the community to get involved and to connect with each other through art,” Dr Bradley said.

“The Spiegeltent program also includes hands-on workshops led by local artists, a poetry slam-night with *The Bunker Spoken Word Series* and a *Disco Rainbow Sparkle Dance Party* for kids.”

Each afternoon audiences can enjoy the sunset in the Wonderland Spiegeltent Garden with a free nightly program of *Live + Local* music accompanied by tasty local brews and eats.

Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the festival also had an interesting and consciously thought-provoking youth program.

“One show I’m particularly looking forward to is a unique performance where 9 – 13 year olds ask challenging questions of grown-ups,” Cr Baberowski said.

*“I’ve Been Meaning To Ask You* is a fantastic way to give our youth a voice and to introduce them to the performing arts all at the same time.

“It’s also a much-needed opportunity to showcase some of our emerging local talent who may go onto decide their calling is a career on the screen and stage.”

Horizon Festival will operate in line with full COVID-safe protocols and with patron and artist safety a priority. More information about COVID protocols can be found on horizonfestival.com.au
