A $1.5 million investment to upgrade Cotton Tree Holiday Park, a further $12.9 million to continue the road upgrades in Mooloolaba, $2.1 million to start upgrading First Avenue at Maroochydore and significant upgrades to parks are among some of the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 4. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Natoli said council had worked very hard to deliver a budget that had something for everyone.\
“With an increasingly diverse and growing community the projects included in this year’s budget will please many Division 4 residents,” Cr Natoli said.\
“The Cotton Tree Holiday Park is set to receive a million-dollar facelift across a number of areas to ensure it remains a destination-of-choice for residents and visitors.\
“The extensive $1.5 million upgrade will deliver a new camp kitchen, new blinds across all cabins and a major overhaul to a large area of powered tent and van sites within the park.

“Road safety continues to be a high priority with planning and design starting on two major intersections in Maroochydore including Maud Street, Dalton Street and Sugar Road, as well as the intersection of Maud Street and Comstar Avenue.\
“The Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade will also move into its next stage with the upgrade of Brisbane Road between Kyamba Court and Tuckers Creek.\
“Council is also investing in several infrastructure projects to improve streetscape, active transport and traffic flow at Maroochydore.\
“A new attractive streetscape will soon transform First Avenue, Maroochydore, into a vibrant, shady and inclusive CBD link, providing businesses, residents and visitors a more inviting space to live, work and play.\
“Funds will be invested in Division 4 parks and playgrounds to help the Sunshine Coast community achieve a healthy, active and sustainable lifestyle.\
“Exercise equipment and new playground features will be installed at Alexandra Headland, Maroochydore, Buddina, Warana and Parrearra and barbecue areas, which will be renewed at Mooloolaba, Minyama and Buddina.\
“Funding has also been allocated to design a shelter shed at the John Hotton Park, Warana.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
