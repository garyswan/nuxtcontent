A new cycling event has hit the Sunshine Coast sporting calendar, and everyone is invited to have a wheelie good time!

The new fun ride on December 19 is a key event on the new Cycle Sunshine Coast festival program.

With varied distances, the Fun Ride includes a 27km and a 17km ride option, the contingent will depart the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) heading through Mountain Creek and onto Buddina before taking in the scenic views along the esplanade at Kawana and then heading back to USC.

The fun ride is almost entirely on bike paths around the Sunshine Coast and is perfect for anyone with a bike – you don’t even need Lycra.

The FREE [fun ride](https://www.aca-cycling.cc/cycle-sunshine-coast/community-ride/)
&#x20;follows other elite competitions and activities - the [SunCentral Maroochdyore CBD Street Criterium](https://www.aca-cycling.cc/cycle-sunshine-coast/nrs-stage-1/)
&#x20;on December 17, the [Peachester Road Race](https://www.aca-cycling.cc/cycle-sunshine-coast/nrs-stage-2/)
&#x20;on December 18, the [North Arm Circuit](https://www.aca-cycling.cc/cycle-sunshine-coast/nrs-stage-3/)
&#x20;on December 19 and precedes the [USC Time Trial](https://www.aca-cycling.cc/cycle-sunshine-coast/nrs-stage-4/)
&#x20;taking place on the same day (Sunday) at USC.

The Sunshine Coast based Australian Cycling Academy is delivering this event in partnership with the University of the Sunshine Coast and Sunshine Coast Council through the Major Events Sponsorship program, and with funding support from the Australian Government and the Queensland Government Cycle Network Local Government Grants program.

With an action packed three days planned, economy portfolio councillor Jason O’Pray said the inaugural Cycle Sunshine Coast event would benefit the Sunshine Coast tourism, sport and leisure industries by showcasing our region as a premium cycling destination and encouraging active and connected communities.

“Sunshine Coast Council is a founding partner of the Australian Cycling Academy, and since its inception in December 2017, the ACA has developed and supported the creation of the elite ‘Pro Racing Sunshine Coast’ cycling team competing on the global stage, as well as a range of community and educational programs for all cycling enthusiasts.

“Their vision to “Live, Learn, Ride” on the Sunshine Coast, aligns closely with council’s Healthy. Smart. Creative. vision.

“The festival offers events for the elite rider through to the all abilities community ride, with courses spread throughout our picturesque region.

“This fantastic variety will mean there’s something for everyone to enjoy,” Cr O’Pray said.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said investing in bike-riding projects was delivering positive benefits for local communities and this fun bike ride was a fantastic opportunity to showcase this.

“The Palaszczuk Government has committed $252 million in funding over the next four years to support and encourage bike riding across the state, including projects across the Sunshine Coast region and its Coastal Pathway, to improve facilities for locals and tourists alike," Mr Bailey said.

“Investments and opportunities like this will help get more people riding more often around the Sunshine Coast community."

The three-day Cycle Sunshine Coast tour will see some of the country’s top cyclists compete in the region for the first time for the National Road Series – going head to head against the local Pro Racing Sunshine Coast riders.
