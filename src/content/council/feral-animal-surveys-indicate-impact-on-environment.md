Feral animals across the region will be surveyed and monitored as Sunshine Coast Council works to minimise their impacts on our community and environment including horticultural crops, domestic pets and native animals.

Council will conduct routine night-time feral animal surveying at Kenilworth, Conondale and Cambroon between Monday, August 15, and Wednesday, August 17.

Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said it was important learn more about feral animals.

“Surveying is used to determine the distribution, population, size, habitat use and impacts of feral animals,” Cr Suarez said.

“Knowing their location and movements helps us understand the activities which can be implemented to minimise their impact on our environment and our community.

“Council has feral animal control programs in place to assist with targeting problem areas and the data collected from this upcoming survey will be used to assess the effectiveness of the current programs.

"Feral animals can negatively impact our environment and community by damaging agricultural and horticultural crops, irrigation and fences, competing with livestock for pasture and supplementary feed, attacking livestock, domestic pets and native animals, damaging trees and native regeneration, the dispersing weed seeds and erosion.”

Some survey results are shared with research organisations, universities and other areas of government across the country, and form the basis for further research, programs and investigations.

The survey is conducted from council roads and reserves and does not require officers to enter private property.

The work will be performed using thermal imaging equipment mounted to a council vehicle. No spotlights are used.

Surveying will be conducted in the following locations:

*   Walli Creek Rd/Walli Mountain Rd, Kenilworth
*   Aherns Rd, Conondale
*   Kilcoy Lane – Broken Bridge Rd, Conondale
*   Eastern Mary River Rd, Cambroon
*   Booloumba Creek Rd, Cambroon

Please report sightings of feral animals in your area to council. Council officers are available to assist with education and action for landowners to minimise the impact of feral animals on their property.
