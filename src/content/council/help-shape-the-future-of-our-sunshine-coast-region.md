Growing sustainably and preserving the things we love about the Sunshine Coast will take careful planning, which is why council is preparing a [new planning scheme](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Planning-Documents/New-Sunshine-Coast-Planning-Scheme)
&#x20;to guide the way we grow and develop as a region.

From today (February 10), residents can provide early input into the scheme development process by providing feedback on proposed planning directions at both a [regional](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/regional-directions)
&#x20;and [local](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/local-directions)
&#x20;level.

A [community reference group](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/New-group-to-help-shape-community-input-on-New-Planning-Scheme-Project310821)
&#x20;has been working with council from the outset of the project, providing valuable feedback about the best ways to engage with our community as part of the plan-making process.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged residents to get involved and [have their say](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme)
&#x20;on the proposed planning directions before March 31.

“Through careful planning, and in partnership with our community, we can provide the foundations that support the opportunities for the future prosperity and liveability of our Sunshine Coast as Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We want to hear from our diverse range of community voices and to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard during this important preliminary engagement phase.

“With that in mind, I’d like to thank the community reference group for their valuable input, which has helped council plan for this preliminary engagement.

"The current planning scheme has been in place since 2014 and a lot has changed, but one thing that remains constant is the importance of maintaining our region’s identity, character and lifestyle.

“The new planning scheme can ensure future growth and development aligns with the evolving views of the community, changes in technologies, updates to state, regional and local planning policies as well as the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Here on the Sunshine Coast, we’ve been experiencing growth for some decades now – it’s not something new.

“We cannot escape the fact that people move to the Coast to enjoy our laid-back lifestyle, community spirit and, of course, our spectacular beaches and hinterland.

“We have seen our Sunshine Coast transform from a collection of small towns to a connected healthy, smart, creative region, all the while retaining our sense of a community of communities.

“The diversity and uniqueness of our local communities is one of the reasons our region is so special, which is why council is seeking feedback on proposed region-wide planning directions as well as proposed planning directions specific to local areas.

“Understanding what a local community considers to be their values and aspirations will ensure that the planning scheme is not one-size-fits-all and allows each of our diverse communities to thrive in their own way.”

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said with the help of our community, the feedback received on the proposed planning directions would be used to prepare a draft new planning scheme that would be subject to further community consultation.

“The planning scheme is, and will continue to be, the key tool to assist council in responding to growth management challenges,” Cr Johnston said.

“The outcomes of the preliminary consultation will be used to inform the preparation of a draft version of the new planning scheme, which will also welcome future community feedback.”

The new planning scheme is intended to be in place by 2024.
