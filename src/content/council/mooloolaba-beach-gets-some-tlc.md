This summer, Sunshine Coast Council will be working with the Queensland Government (Marine Safety Queensland) as part of their project to remove sand from the mouth of the Mooloolah River.

Marine Safety Queensland (MSQ) needs to remove sand from the entrance channel of the Mooloolaba harbour and the surrounding sand shoal for marine safety.

We will use this sand to restore Mooloolaba beach which has been affected by the erosion that occurred during the severe weather earlier in the year. We also want to protect it from the upcoming summer storms.

Beach scarping on Mooloolaba Beach

There will be some changes to beach access while the work takes place. For your own safety, please follow signage and stick to the pedestrian pathway while the machines are working.

MSQ will use a dredge to suck the sand from the mouth of the Mooloolah River and the shoal in Mooloolaba Bay.

The dredge will connect to council’s pipeline that is already buried beneath the sand along Mooloolaba Beach.

Using a booster pump, the sand will be transported through the pipeline to where it’s needed further up the beach.

The sand will be placed on the beach from the Cheeseblock (Uranga Esp) to the Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club.
