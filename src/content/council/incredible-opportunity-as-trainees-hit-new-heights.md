This is the ultimate career booster, a work experience program that starts at the bottom and rises all the way to the top.

Sunshine Coast Council is taking its traineeship program to new heights, even incorporating a “CEO experience’’.

Trainees Erin Wooldridge and Georgia Porteous recently joined CEO Emma Thomas, gaining a rare insight into what it takes to run one of the nation’s biggest and busiest councils.

They sat in on numerous meetings with the CEO, covering a variety of projects and initiatives that will benefit our community into the future.

This could have been a glimpse into the future for the duo, who’ve excelled in their 12-month traineeships with Council and are nominees for the Queensland Government’s [Bob Marshman Trainee of the Year Award](https://desbt.qld.gov.au/training/qta/enter/award-categories#:~:text=Bob%20Marshman%20Trainee%20of%20the,year%20current%20at%20nomination%20time.)
.

While executive decisions are still a way off yet for Erin and Georgia, pursuing a Council traineeship has proven to be a great call for their careers.    

### Traineeships help guide new career path

“I have had an exceptional experience during my traineeship with Council – there have been so many opportunities and projects I have been able to take part in,” Georgia said.

“Previously, I was working in retail and didn’t see the career path I wanted going forward in that sector.

“I was interested in Business Management & Technology Solutions and the Sunshine Coast Council traineeship seemed like an excellent opportunity to begin to build my career in that direction.

“I have recently obtained a full-time position in the Meeting Management Team and I’m looking forward to working with them for the foreseeable future.”

Erin described her traineeship experience as “incredible”.

“Working in People Services as a trainee at Sunshine Coast Council has provided an excellent opportunity to develop new skills and kick start my career,” Erin said.

“The skills I have developed during my time as a trainee have been extremely valuable and I will be able to take these skills anywhere I go.

“I have also been lucky enough to secure a full-time position as a Human Resources Officer and I’m super excited in continuing to learn and grow throughout my career at Council.”

CEO Emma Thomas said Council traineeships were a terrific opportunity for people with limited qualifications and work experience to get a great start in future employment and earn a wage.

“Council offers a range of opportunities for people of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels to gain employment and broaden their career skills,” Ms Thomas said.

“It’s wonderful to see so many people like Erin and Georgia pursuing career start-up opportunities with Council and going on to great things within our organisation and elsewhere.

“I think we’ll be seeing them in more meetings about the future of our city in years to come.”  

This year, traineeships were offered in built infrastructure, economic and community development, business performance, customer and planning services, liveability and natural assets and civic governance.

The next round of Council traineeships will be offered early next year.

Prior to this, Sunshine Coast university students and TAFE students can kickstart their careers and earn a wage with Council’s My Summer Workplace program.

My Summer Workplace is a 10-week program that runs from November to February, providing tertiary students with the opportunity to gain experience in their chosen profession in one of Australia’s most dynamic local government organisations.
