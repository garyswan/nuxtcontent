Community groups, residents and local leaders today (September 23, 2021) took the first tour through the Beerwah Community Meeting Place – the Sunshine Coast’s newest community facility.

The new Sunshine Coast Council community space was constructed thanks to $1.65 million from the Queensland Government’s Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package.

Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said Sunshine Coast-based teams from Bark Architects and Be! Building Group brought the project to life which also helped to drive economic recovery during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“What a way to contribute to the region, by not only creating local jobs, but also by providing this beautiful and spacious resource for the community to enjoy,” Ms Boyd said.

Deputy Mayor and local Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said he was thrilled with the innovative and sustainable design of the meeting place.

“This is a brilliant extension to the precinct. The Beerwah and district community love this civic precinct and have been looking forward to having a larger community space,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Inspired by the natural environment that surrounds us, the Beerwah Community Meeting Place’s design takes into account the winter sun, summer shade, natural breezes and landscape to ensure all who use this space are comfortable. 

“It’s also great to see that these flexible, multi-functional and adaptable indoor/outdoor meeting areas and social spaces will suit all sorts of group sizes and needs.

“I’m very grateful to everyone involved in planning and delivering this people-focused project and I look forward to the many initiatives that emanate from its use.

“This building will be part of the community heart of Beerwah where we can see our community culture, arts and heritage come to life, in a lake-side precinct that already hosts the Beerwah library, community hall and Turner Park.”

Some of the Meeting Place’s sustainability measures include using recycled and locally sourced hardwood, plantation pine lining and other low maintenance and durable building materials.

The 3.15kW solar system, which can be expanded in the future, will offset some of the building’s energy use.

The Beerwah Community Meeting Place is located next door to the [Beerwah](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About-Libraries/Open-Hours/Beerwah-Library)
