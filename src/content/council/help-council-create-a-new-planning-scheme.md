A planning scheme sets out council’s plan for managing growth and change within our region.

It applies to land that you own or rent and affects what you can do with your land and what your neighbour can do with theirs.

Council is in the early stages of preparing a new planning scheme and everyone will soon have the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed planning directions for our region.

Visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Planning-Documents/New-Sunshine-Coast-Planning-Scheme)
&#x20;and sign up today to receive project updates, details on engagement activities and be the first to have your say when consultation begins.
