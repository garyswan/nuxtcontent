Rosebed Street in Eudlo will be seeing even more green with Sunshine Coast Council finalising the new streetscape design.

In November last year, council asked the community to share what they loved and what could be improved to enhance Rosebed Street, so a draft streetscape concept plan could be developed.  

Sunshine Coast Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said further feedback was sought on the final concept plan in July 2021.

“Thank you to all the locals, visitors and businesses who worked with our Placemaking and Design team, attended a series of community events and completed the online surveys, so we can create a cool, shady and green space we can all enjoy,” Cr Johnston said.

“This new and improved streetscape aims to enhance the day-to-day experience of people living, working and visiting the hinterland town.  

“The final concept plan reflects the community’s values and vision for safer streets both for pedestrians and road users, and provides an attractive and appealing walkable environment which is cool and leafy.

“To keep our youngest residents safe when walking and riding to school, the pedestrian crossing on Rosebed Street and Corlis Avenue will be upgraded.  

“Three new garden beds will be installed along the main street to beautify and green the urban environment.

“I’m proud to see the final design embody the community’s values and deliver social, economic and sustainable benefits for locals and businesses in Eudlo.”

Council’s series of placemaking projects aims to create vibrant places that enhance the unique characters of our towns by drawing from community feedback.

Construction is scheduled to take place from Monday, January 10, 2022 and is expected to take two weeks, weather and site conditions dependant. Council will keep the community updated as the project progresses.

**Key elements of the concept:**

*   An upgrade to the school crossing on Rosebed Street and the road crossing on Corlis Avenue to create safer streets for pedestrians and motorists.
*   Realignment of carparks in the centre of Rosebed Street to create three garden beds for large, leafy trees to create a shady, cool and green street.
*   Placement of new gardens to create an attractive and appealing walkable environment.
