Just a reminder: Waste and recycling collections continue as per the normal schedule over the upcoming loooong weekend.

Your bins will be collected, even on Good Friday and Easter Monday! And a friendly reminder - don't forget to bring your bins in after bin day.

Councilâ€™s resource recovery facilities are open as normal on these days, but the recycle markets are closed.

Visit Council's website for the [opening times](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Rubbish-Tip-Locations-and-Fees)
&#x20;and for [more information about bin collection days](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Bin-collection-days)
