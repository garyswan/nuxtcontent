The Sunshine Coast community has one more week to have a say on proposed planning directions for the new planning scheme.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged anyone with an interest in what our region could look like in 2041 to go online, complete the surveys and submit their feedback by March 31.

“This preliminary consultation is open for one more week and it’s important all community members have their say on the proposed planning directions for our region and local areas,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Consultation at this early stage of the planning process is non-statutory; however, council wants to understand what our local communities consider to be their values and aspirations.

“We aren’t at the detailed stage of the new planning scheme yet. This preliminary consultation is gathering feedback from each of our diverse communities so that our future plan can help them all thrive in their own way.

“With more people choosing to call the Sunshine Coast home, I urge all of our residents to take advantage of this fantastic opportunity to have their say on the region’s future.”

The outcomes of the preliminary consultation will be used to inform preparation of the new planning scheme, including local area provisions.

The community will have a further opportunity to provide feedback when a draft version of the new planning scheme is released for formal public consultation.

The new planning scheme is intended to be in place by 2024.

**How you can have your say:**

View the proposed planning directions and provide your feedback by completing the [online surveys](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/regional-directions#regional-survey)
&#x20;before next Thursday, March 31.
