Health and wellbeing, community connection, transport, volunteering and a greater voice in decision making were among the topics discussed at an “enthusiastic and positive’’ community forum.

Around 100 people have taken part in a region-wide forum at Meridan Community Centre to help review and refresh Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Strategy Action Plan (2019-2024).

All local community members were invited to attend and those who accepted included individuals and those representing organisations and businesses.

All had the same goal – to work towards a ‘stronger community’.

Stronger Together Forum Sunshine Coast Council

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the forum brought a range of individuals of all ages, abilities, backgrounds and interests together and each shared unique insights and experiences.

“The gathering used a variety of methods such as storytelling and group activities, designed so we could really listen and better understand what the future opportunities and challenges are for our region,” Cr Law said.

“The day was full of conversations and connection. The energy and enthusiasm in the room was overwhelmingly positive and a true demonstration of how we can collectively seek to build a stronger community together.

“The information collected at the forum will help to inform a refreshed Community Strategy Action Plan for 2024-2029 that will continue to improve the way we live, work and play on the Sunshine Coast. 

“I want to acknowledge the valuable ideas and contributions made at the forum to generate a refreshed Action Plan.

“I also wish to acknowledge the members of the Community Strategy Leadership Group who volunteered their time to plan and co-host the forum and ensure the day was full of rich conversations.

“Residents can still provide their feedback on the Action Plan on [Council’s Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stronger-together)
&#x20;before May 30.”
