Due to community interest, Sunshine Coast Council is looking at establishing a new Dog Exercise Area (DEA) on the southern Sunshine Coast.  

Over the past several years, Council has received numerous requests for a DEA in Pelican Waters and now is the time for the community to tell us their preference!

### In Pelican Waters, three fenced sites have been identified as suitable:

*   Judy Henzell Park
*   Raptor Park
*   Scribbly Gum Park

Please share your feedback on your preferred option for Pelican Waters by completing the online survey on Council’s [w](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/pelican-waters-dog-exercise-area) [ebsite](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/pelican-waters-dog-exercise-area)
&#x20;before **June 2, 2023**.

[**Click here to complete survey**](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/pelican-waters-dog-exercise-area)


### Council is seeking feedback to better understand:

*   If the community is supportive of the plan to install a dog exercise area?
*   How regularly residents would use a new local dog exercise area?
*   Of the identified sites, which is the preferred location?

Council endeavours to provide high quality open space that supports active and healthy communities, and we look forward to working together to get the best outcome for Pelican Waters.

Community feedback received during this engagement phase will help Council understand the community demand and best location for a DEA.

The construction of the proposed DEA has not been scheduled. If the community supports the project, it will be developed in stages.
