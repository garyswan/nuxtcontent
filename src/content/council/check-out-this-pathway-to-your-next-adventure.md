An exciting new link in the Sunshine Coast’s beautiful coastal pathway is open and ready for adventure.

Whether you’re riding a bike, enjoying a scenic stroll with family and friends or tackling a cardio-boosting run, this is the place to be!

The 850 metre Warana section of [Coastal Pathway](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Coastal-Pathway)
, which straddles the Division 3 and 4 boundary, forms part of the 73-kilometre-long route from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

100m raised boardwalk

Sunshine Coast Council Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said he was pleased to officially open the new link which had been well received by the community.

“What don’t you love about the sweeping vistas as you walk, ride, run, scoot or skate alongside the open beach,” Cr Cox said.

“One of my favourite sections is between Palkana Wetland and Beach Access 234, where there’s a 100-metre raised boardwalk allowing users to travel through a seasonal tea tree wetland. 

“This section offers a chance for our community to hear the site come to life during frog mating season or see it explode with butterflies at various times of the year.”

Bush revegetation works are ongoing, including managing weeds and assisted generation of native vegetation. 

The long-term bush regeneration and offset planting is an important part of the Coastal Pathway project which has seen almost 900 plants and trees planted in this stage of works.

*Warana Coastal Pathway*

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the Coastal Pathway provided a great opportunity for residents to explore the Sunshine Coast while spending time outdoors.

“These safe, connected pathways are great for residents to have some fun with family and friends and it’s a really wonderful way of seeing the beauty of the coastline while staying active,” Cr Natoli said.

“This stage of coastal pathway is accessible for all our community, including parents with prams and especially people living with a disability.

“I’d also like to thank the adjacent residents for their cooperation during the construction period.”

The Coastal pathway is part of the Sunshine Coast Council Community Strategy 2019-2041 which empowers our community to live a healthy and active lifestyle and meets the needs of people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds.

The pathway is being completed in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council and the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ Cycle Network Local Government Grants Program.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said investing in active transport projects was delivering positive benefits for local communities.

“I’m a keen bike rider and runner, so I understand the importance of delivering more active transport infrastructure for Queenslanders like this shared path in Warana,” Mr Bailey said.

“We know that on average, every dollar we invest in active transport infrastructure will return nearly five dollars in economic benefit to Queensland with improved health outcomes, reduced traffic congestion, and lower transport costs.

“That’s why the Palaszczuk Government is delivering $268.8 million worth of active transport projects across Queensland over the next four years.

“That includes projects just like this one in Warana which the Sunshine Coast Council and Mayor Mark Jamieson have done a fantastic job on.”

Council reminds everyone to share the path when out and about. All users should have respect for others and slow down, keep left, pass on the right, and don’t block the pathway for others.
