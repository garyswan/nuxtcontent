Upgrades to the Queen Street, Caloundra intersections, investments at Caloundra Aquatic Centre and Caloundra Regional Tennis Centre and construction of a ‘missing link’ in the Coastal Pathway at Dicky Beach, are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 2. 

Divisional councillor Terry Landsberg said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future.

“I’m very pleased to see $1.6 million has been allocated to upgrade two intersections on Queen Street at Ulm Street and Bower Street at Caloundra to address community concerns,” Cr Landsberg said.

“These upgrades will improve the safety of this busy stretch of road for residents and visitors.

“Council and Transport and Main Roads have jointly allocated around $1.5 million for the detailed design of the Nicklin Way to Omrah Avenue corridor upgrade in Caloundra.

“The Dicky Beach Precinct Stage 1 project will continue with $280,000 invested to complete the skate park and $100,000 to complete the landscape and pathway works to complement the public amenities building and shelter.

“The SS Dicky propeller will also be installed after being taken off site while stage 1 construction works were undertaken.

“A further $350,000 has been allocated this year, to start construction of the SS Dicky Memorial deck.”

Cr Landsberg said the next stage of the Coastal Pathway would continue from Dicky Beach Park to Sir Leslie Park, Dicky Beach, with $750,000 allocated this year.

“The Coastal Pathway is the Sunshine Coast’s most popular shared pathway extending 73 kilometres from Bells Creek at Golden Beach in the south, to Coolum in the north,” he said.

“I’m also very pleased to see funding allocated to maintaining sports infrastructure in Division 2 including $1.1 million for the Caloundra Aquatic Centre and $600,000 for the Regional Tennis Centre.”

The Caloundra Centre Activation project, which includes the Caloundra, Community and Creative Hub and the refurbishment of Council’s Administration Building to the green star district-level library, continues with a $1.94 million investment.

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
