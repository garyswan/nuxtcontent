A more environmentally conscious approach to contracting and engaging with local suppliers is  a highlight of  Sunshine Coast Council’s 2022-23 Procurement and Disposal Policy.

The new policy was endorsed by council at today’s Ordinary Meeting (June 23).

Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the new procurement policy included the introduction of an Environment and Sustainability in Procurement guideline which would inform future contracting decisions.

“The new Environment and Sustainability in Procurement Guideline outlines council’s framework for and approach to conducting contracting activities in an environmentally considerate and sustainable manner,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Council’s 2022-23 Procurement and Disposal Policy continues to include a Local Preference in Procurement Guideline, which supports council’s Regional Economic Development Strategy 2013-2033.

This guideline has resulted in council spending $265 million with local suppliers for the current financial year (to May 31) which represents 71 per cent of council’s total purchasing spend.”  

The 2022-23 Procurement and Disposal Policy will also continue to encourage engagement with First Nation businesses and suppliers with social missions centred on benefitting people who are considered disadvantaged in the local community.

“This resulted in Council spending $1.8 million with First Nations businesses during the 2021-22 financial year,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Council will continue to deliver programs which support and assist local [suppliers to win more work with council.”](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Business-Gateway)
