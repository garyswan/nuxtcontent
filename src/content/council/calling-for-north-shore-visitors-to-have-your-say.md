Sunshine Coast Council is considering how it can balance the needs of both our community and wildlife at the popular Maroochy North Shore beach, Mudjimba, and is asking for [community feedback](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/shorebird-impacts-northshor)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Acting Coastal, Constructed Water Bodies and Planning Manager Raeleen Draper said the Maroochy North Shore, Mudjimba, was a popular and important place for our community, our environment and the local and visiting wildlife.

“From calm water river swimming, catching ocean waves, to off-leash sandy fun for the fur-baby – the Maroochy North Shore area is a popular place for our community and visitors to our region, at all times of the year,” Ms Draper said.

“It’s also an important environmental area for local and visiting wildlife.

“Through this survey, we are trying to better understand the users of this area, their motivations and demographics, and their knowledge of the unique environmental values of the lower Maroochy River, so we can continue to balance the needs of our community and preserve the natural environment.

“Independent experts from the University of Queensland have been engaged to conduct an online survey and will also interview people in person on location at Mudjimba.

“They will then evaluate the answers and make recommendations to council on how our community can continue to enjoy the lower Maroochy River in harmony with nature.”

You are invited to have your say by [completing the confidential survey](https://uniofqueensland.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2fW00qhZNpmkuX4)
 before August 31, 2022, or by completing in-person interviews at North Shore throughout July and August.
