We are halfway through our upgrade of Buderim Off Leash Dog Park - work to the large dog park is complete and ready for our four-legged friends to stretch their legs.

This upgrade has been staggered so part of the park could stay open all the time.

#### What's been completed during stage one of Buderim Off-Leash Dog Park

Stage one included:

*   extended the large dog park for more space to run
*   added a new entry point
*   fixed the drainage to keep furry paws dry
*   laid new grass (turf) to play on
*   upgraded the pathway
*   added some Sandstone Seating
*   rewired the fencing.

Next, we’ll be upgrading the second stage of the large dog park and the small dog park – we expect it will be re-opened to our dog loving community by mid-2023.

Thanks for your patience as we work to make this popular dog park even better.

Buddha had a trial run inside the revamped dog park before it reopened to the community.
