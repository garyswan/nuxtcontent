**Meet your cool neighbour at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve**

Explore the amazing world of reptiles and amphibians at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve. They aren’t always the most popular of neighbours, but they are certainly very ‘cool’. These amazing cold-blooded creatures, collectively called herptiles, live all around us and are uniquely adapted to Australia’s hot, dry climate. Learn about the frog who carries his tadpoles round in his pockets, the caring snake who cuddles her eggs to keep them warm and the striking lizard who can change its colour.

On now at the Rainforest Discovery Centre, open daily between 9.30am-3.30pm.
