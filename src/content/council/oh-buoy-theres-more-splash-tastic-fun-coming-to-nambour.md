Nambour Aquatic Centre is one step closer to becoming one of the region’s most exciting community splash parks with the installation of two giant new water slides.

The finishing touches are now underway on the Nambour Aquatic Splash Park, which is expected to open in the coming months, weather permitting, followed by an official opening celebration in the warmer September school holiday period.

The colourful new slides measuring 60 and 67 metres will join the zero-depth and fully accessible [splash pad](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Nambour-makes-a-splash-with-kids-new-water-wonderland-180122)
&#x20;which is already open.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was thrilled to see the Nambour Aquatic Splash Park transform.

“The Splash Pad is very popular with families and we know the slides will be just as sensational when they open in the coming months,” Cr Law said.

“The completed water-wonderland will be a major drawcard for the Nambour area.”

Together with the Centre’s existing 50 metre lap pool and 25 metre indoor pool, the new water play facilities will allow people of all ages to enjoy hours of healthy and active fun.

Be sure to follow Sunshine Coast Council on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SunshineCoastCouncil)
&#x20;for more details to follow on early access and official opening celebrations.

The Nambour Aquatic Splash Park is being developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s Works for Queensland program in association with Sunshine Coast Council, and pool lessee Belgravia Leisure.

The $3.26 million investment includes the recent addition of 44 new car parking spaces, a zero-depth splash pad play area and two adventure slides.

The Nambour Aquatic Centre is one of nine council-owned aquatic centres across our region, the others are located at Beerwah, Buderim, Caloundra, Coolum-Peregian, Cotton Tree, Eumundi, Kawana, and Palmwoods.
