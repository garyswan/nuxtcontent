Sunshine Coast Council is undertaking a Mooloolaba Visitation Study to better understand how the local visitor economy has been, and is currently, performing and the broader factors relating to commercial and economic trends in the area.

The study seeks to gather feedback from local businesses, residents, and visitors to Mooloolaba.

You can share your thoughts by completing a [short online survey](http://tiny.cc/visitation-study-story)
.

The survey results will assist council and the Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce to better understand community needs and consider potential solutions as part of the study.

Findings from the survey will be used to inform council’s decision-making process about how to ensure Mooloolaba continues to be an attractive and convenient place to visit.

Don’t miss your opportunity to have your say! The [survey](http://tiny.cc/visitation-study-story)
&#x20;takes just 10 minutes and will close at 11pm Sunday 17 October 2021.

All responses will be kept confidential.

Have questions or want to learn more about this project? Please email mooloolabavisitationstudy\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.

Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback.
