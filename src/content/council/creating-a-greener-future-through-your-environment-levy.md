Ratepayers have helped preserve precious habitats, protect our foreshores and support community groups devoted to conservation through the region’s Environment Levy.

In 2021/22, Levy funds have again supported an array of diverse projects, programs and initiatives to help protect and enhance our valued natural assets.

These achievements have been revealed in Sunshine Coast Council’s Annual Environment Levy Report.

**Environment Levy Investment at a glance**

*   $5.67 million spent on the acquisition of four properties adding a further 165 hectares to Council’s conservation estate
*   $1.1 million invested into coastal protection works and dune rehabilitation  
*   $610,000 provided to 19 partnership community groups
*   $740,000 invested into invasive species research, action and community engagement
*   $325,000 in Landholder Environment Grants for 103 private landholders to undertake on-ground projects, and
*   $220,000 invested into erosion and sediment control and waterway protection

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said it was wonderful to see the Environment Levy continue to deliver to protect and enhance our natural assets.

“Many of these projects are undertaken in partnership with dedicated volunteers, landholders, community groups and research organisations who share council’s interest in creating a legacy that will benefit our community for decades to come,” Cr Suarez said.

“In 2021/22, the Environment Levy contributed approximately 165 hectares of environmental land to council’s 7,864 hectares owned and/or managed reserve network, of which more than 4000 hectares has been secured through the Environment Levy— protecting precious habitat areas and the animals that live in them.

“We have continued to lead the way in advancing invasive species management, trialling innovative technologies to control pest animals and weeds that threaten our biodiversity.”

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said he was pleased that, through the Environment Levy, council was able to support landholders to protect their properties and their values from invasive species.

“This year’s program saw the inclusion of new projects focussed on protecting our much-loved waterways—fundamental to the liveability of our region,” Cr Cox said.

“Through these award-winning projects we are engaging, educating and supporting industry and the community in fostering sustainable practices through improved erosion and sediment control.

“We are pleased to celebrate the success of the projects, programs and initiatives funded by the Environment Levy and would like to thank our volunteers —the students, landholders and community groups — for their enthusiasm, passion and commitment in caring for our natural environment.”

**Strategic Land Acquisition Program at a glance**

The Environment Levy has continued to support the acquisition of environmentally significant land to protect and enhance habitat areas and biodiversity corridors. Four properties were purchased in 2021/22 — adding a further 165 hectares to Council’s conservation estate.

This included:

*   68 hectares of high-value habitat at Witta: expanding Kirby’s Road Environment Reserve to 280 hectares and further consolidating landscape connectivity between Maleny and Kondalilla National Parks.
*   65 hectares at Coochin Creek: further consolidating the Regional Inter-urban Break Green Space and protecting 450 metres of Coochin Creek riparian habitat (which flows into the RAMSAR-designated Pumicestone Passage)
*   19 hectares within the Blue Heart Sunshine Coast project area expanding Coolum Creek Environment Reserve to 465 hectares, protecting Maroochy River riparian habitat and providing opportunity to consolidate connectivity of the Maroochy-Noosa Wallum biodiversity corridor.
*   13 hectares in Verrierdale:  expanding an existing protected area of very high biodiversity values to 37 hectares to further protect critically endangered lowland rainforest regional ecosystems and habitat for the Richmond birdwing butterfly (*Ornithoptera richmondia*).

Two Environment Levy funded projects were recently recognised for their contributions in improving stormwater management and sediment control practices with council’s Construction Management and Waterway Protection Taskforce winning an award at the 2022 Stormwater Queensland Awards and council’s Regional Erosion and Sediment Education and Training (RESET) Facility receiving Highly Commended at the International Erosion Control Association 2022 conference.
