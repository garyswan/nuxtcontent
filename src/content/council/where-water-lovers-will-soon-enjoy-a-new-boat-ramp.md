The Palaszczuk Government and Sunshine Coast Council are working to secure a major upgrade to a public boat ramp and trailer parking at one of the region’s busiest waterways.

The smooth, easy-access ramp and 36 car-trailer parks are planned at Outrigger Island, Minyama, on the stunning Mooloolah River. The work is expected to start in the 2023–24 financial year.

Maritime Safety Queensland is working with the Council to secure the new project for Sunshine Coast boaties and tourists.

The state's Maritime Infrastructure Investment Program is funding the boat ramp and floating walkway.

The Federal Government is contributing to Council's landside works through its Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, and the Palaszczuk Government through its Southeast Queensland Community Stimulus Program. The landside works are scheduled to start this financial year.

Upgrade plans to the boat ramp.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey MP said the facility was a high priority.

"The proposed new two-lane boat ramp, floating walkway and car-parking were identified as a high priority in the 2017 Recreational Boating Facilities Demand Forecasting Study,” Mr Bailey said.

"This project is one of many the Palaszczuk Government for the Sunshine Coast and surrounding areas over the next four years."

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the extensive upgrade would significantly improve the amenity and practicality of the site for all boaties, water users and community groups.

“Boaties, fishing lovers and water users, including the Panamuna Outrigger Canoe Club, are already familiar with the rough terrain and informal carpark at the much-loved Outrigger Park. I expect the upgrade will be warmly welcomed by all water enthusiasts,” Cr Natoli said.

“Council is also planning to deliver community assets, including new public amenities, for those who wish to stay ashore.

“The design will improve access to the water and create an inviting place to spend time outdoors.

“Council is pleased to be delivering this project in partnership with the Albanese and Palaszczuk Governments."

Member for Caloundra, Jason Hunt MP said the identified site at Outrigger Island is likely the last available location for a new recreational boating facility.

"It will provide consistent open-water access from Mooloolaba,” Mr Hunt said.

"The new facility will take pressure off the popular Parkyn Parade and La Balsa Park boat ramps. It will assist in meeting community demand for boat launching facilities over the next 20 years."

The Australian Government is contributing $400,000 to Council's landside works through its Local Roads and Community Infrastructure (LRCI) Program, and the Queensland Government through its South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.

The LRCI Program supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across the nation, supporting jobs and delivering benefits to local communities.

The landside works are scheduled to start this financial year.
