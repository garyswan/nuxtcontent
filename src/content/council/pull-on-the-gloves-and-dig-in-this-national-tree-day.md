The Sunshine Coast community is encouraged to book now for National Tree Day and join in Australia’s largest tree planting event at one of seven free family friendly tree planting events being held across the region from July 23 to August 6.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez encouraged the community to dig in and sign up for a family friendly tree planting event near them.

“The main event on July 31 will be an opportunity for our community to lend a hand to further restore the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve, spend a day outdoors and connect with nature,” Cr Suarez said.

“The reserve is a special place and an important coastal habitat area with vegetation that ranges from iconic coastal heath, scribbly gum forest to melaleuca wetlands.

“It’s home to more than 125 different bird and 24 different mammal species and vulnerable wallum frogs.

“Our community has helped council restore the reserve for many years, and in the last three years alone, has planted more than 11,700 native trees, shrubs and ground covers.

“There are also six other free family tree planting events that they can sign up to help restore their local environment.

“We invite everyone across the region to be part of Australia’s largest tree planting event at a local level because every tree or shrub planted makes a difference and is a win for the local wildlife and biodiversity of our region.”
