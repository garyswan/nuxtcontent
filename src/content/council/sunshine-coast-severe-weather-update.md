Some of our community, especially at Landsborough, Beerwah, Peachester and surrounds, are still doing it tough after yesterday morning’s severe storm (Thursday March 3).

Please be aware some roads have been significantly damaged. There are fallen trees and powerlines are down.

Where possible, stay away from these areas for your own safety and to allow damage assessments and repairs to take place.

Hundreds of properties are still without power and it’s taking time for everyone’s power to be restored.

The crews remain hard at work and communications to the area are being restored as a high priority. Council, SES and our emergency services partners continue to provide assistance and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services crews are conducting rapid damage assessments so property owners can get the help they need.

FLOOD DAMAGE UPDATE - TIP FEE WAIVER EXTENDED: Sunshine Coast Council is offering free domestic general and food waste disposal to residents impacted by flooding for a further week until close of business Sunday 13 March.

This extension will give our residents impacted by flooding extra time to remove and dispose their general and food waste and help spread out the demand at our resource recovery centres.

We are putting on extra staff at our tips and thank you for your understanding and patience as our staff deal with the expected increase in customer numbers.

GARDEN WASTE: Landsborough and Beerwah areas were significantly damaged in yesterday morning’s thunderstorm.

We are putting in place a solution for you to dispose of your fallen vegetation. For anyone outside Landsborough and Beerwah, our green waste storage areas are full and we are unable to receive large volumes of green waste at this time.

We are doing our utmost to receive greater volumes and thank you for your patience. We’ll keep our community updated and let you know when we can accept green waste.

In the short-term, we ask you to please store garden waste on your property until we can decrease the current stocks at our transfer stations.
