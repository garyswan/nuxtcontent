Sunshine Coast Council’s ParkSmart program trial is rolling out to new locations on March 27, 2023.

The ParkSmart program trial will introduce its third vehicle, equipped with number plate recognition, high-speed cameras and advanced computer software, to Maroochydore, including the Cotton Tree and Picnic Point areas Mooloolaba and Alexandra Headland.

Sunshine Coast Council Customer and Planning Services Group Executive Debra Robinson said that, just like phase one and two, there would be a four-week educational period with caution notices issued before infringements would then be imposed.

“This new parking monitoring technology is aimed at creating impartial and safe access to various locations across our popular regions,” Ms Robinson said.

**“It’s also focused on providing a safer work environment for parking officers and reducing the risk of occupational violence.**

“We have seen a real reduction in occupational violence in our trial areas, so we’re keen to continue streamlining this less intrusive parking monitoring, by adding these further four locations.

“We also look forward to supporting the local businesses in Maroochydore, including the Cotton Tree and Picnic Point areas, Mooloolaba and Alexandra Headland as ParkSmart provides greater coverage and capacity to encourage visitor turnover.

“We’ve been seeing the benefits of using this new technology in highly concentrated locations, such as Eumundi during the bi-weekly Eumundi Markets,” she said.

Introducing the ParkSmart trial to Maroochydore, Mooloolaba and Alexandra Headlands provides a further opportunity to understand the benefits of the technology around major events held in these areas.

#### **ParkSmart Fast Facts:**

*   During the trial, regulated parking patrols may be carried out by foot patrol or the ParkSmart vehicle with council’s Regulated Parking Officers.
*   If the area has been patrolled by the ParkSmart vehicle, you will receive your caution or infringement notice by post.
*   If the area has been patrolled by a foot patrol, you will receive your infringement notice on your windscreen, which is in line with our current practice.
*   Equipped with number plate recognition, the ParkSmart vehicle is fitted with six high speed cameras and a GPS tracking system.
*   The vehicle captures images of parked vehicles and records the vehicle location (GPS coordinates), number plate and time.
*   It allows council to monitor regulated parking areas to ensure motorists are adhering to parking regulations and ensures equitable and safe access to various parking locations in our region.
*   ParkSmart operates in all weather conditions and identifies regulated parking conditions on the street.
*   Those with a Disability Parking Permit are required under their permit conditions to clearly display the permit on the windshield of their vehicle.
