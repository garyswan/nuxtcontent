Sunshine Coast Council is inviting local artists and creative practitioners to apply for funding through the Regional Arts Development Fund’s (RADF) Grants program, after securing a record investment from Arts Queensland.

Applications for the November round of RADF grants are open now and close on 1 November. Submissions can be made online at [sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Regional-Arts-Development-Fund.)


Council’s RADF officer is hosting one-on-one meetings for those who need assistance to prepare their funding submission.

One-on-one meetings will be held across the region at:

*   Eumundi, Imperial Hotel, Thursday 16 September
*   Maroochydore Library, Monday 20 September
*   Caloundra Library, Friday 24 September

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said RADF was a very welcome 60:40 funding partnership between Sunshine Coast Council and Queensland Government and sought to foster and invest in the region’s energetic arts sector.

“Arts Queensland’s increased investment to a best ever $115,00 this year, together with council’s 60 percent contribution, means local arts and cultural priorities including the Grants Program, are better supported this year with an allocation of more than $287,500,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Last year’s program certainly generated some remarkable opportunities for the region and I’m genuinely excited in anticipation of the projects our region’s artists, producers and practitioners will present this year.

“In this year’s July 2021 funding round, [seven local artists](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Funding-Outcomes/Previous-Successful-Applicants)
&#x20;will receive almost $40,000 for an thought-provoking range of developmental projects in a diverse mix of genres.”

Minister for the Arts Leeanne Enoch said the Queensland Government was investing $2.08 million through the RADF in 2021-22, matched with a contribution of approximately $2.3 million from 59 councils across the state.  

“RADF is a great example of working together to deliver our COVID-19 economic recovery plan, supporting employment opportunities and creating new arts and cultural experiences in local and regional communities,” Minister Enoch said.      

“RADF in 2021-2022 will provide valuable social, health and economic outcomes for regional Queenslanders, and support our Government’s 10-year arts roadmap priorities to strengthen Queensland communities, activate local places, and drive social change across the state. 

“Our investment complements the Queensland Government’s wider commitment to regional arts, including continued support of $6 million over four years for the Regional Arts Services Network (RASN),” she said. 

**Successful projects for the July 2021 round include:**

*   Courtney Scheu of Buderim for her Sand dance development and local presentation
*   Kenny Waterson of Moffat Beach for his ‘Pure Imagination’ screen project
*   Patricia McInerney also of Moffat Beach for her ‘Basket of Hammers Presents – Samhain 31/10’ interdisciplinary project.

The visual arts were well represented this round with:

*   Laura Vecmane Bartlett, of Maleny, undertaking a mentorship with sculptor Janna Pameijer’  
*   Beerwah’s Claire Letitia Reynolds for her ‘We are One’ photographic project, and Elizabeth Derham of Peregian Springs for her ‘Sensing the Landscape: -Through a painter’s Eyes’ work
*   Maleny’s Leigh Robshaw was successful in securing funding to translate her memoir, “You had me at Hola” into an audiobook.

Funding is awarded to projects that align with the Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018-2038, which provides a 20-year vision for the region, placing artists at its core.

RADF Grant applications can be submitted all year round. There are three rounds, closing 1 March, 1 July and 1 November.

*   Individual Development - $750 within Australia and $1500 international

*   Project - Up to $10,000
