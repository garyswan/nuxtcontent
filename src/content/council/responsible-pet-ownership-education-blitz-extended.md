Following on from a successful campaign in Point Cartwright, Sunshine Coast Council will extend the pet education pop-ups to other popular dog locations across the coast over the next two months to raise awareness among our 51,400 registered dog owners about their responsibilities.

The education campaign was held at Point Cartwright in early April in response to complaints and to ensure dog owners knew their responsibilities while in public with their pet.

Divisional Councillor Joe Natoli said he was pleased residents engaged with council officers, and an ongoing education was still important.

“More than 700 people and almost 250 dogs were observed, and 380 residents engaged with our officers during our education blitz over the school holiday period,” Cr Natoli said.

“I’m pleased to report that less than 20 infringements had to be issued, however sadly, there were a few instances of owners evading our officers and also giving false details which required the involvement of the Queensland Police Service. That just isn’t good enough.

“We know people love to bring their dogs to Point Cartwright and council is committed to raising awareness of pet owner responsibilities so we can be considerate to residents in the local community and visitors to the area.”

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said council would continue to focus on responsible pet ownership education at Point Cartwright and extend the education blitz to other locations along the coast.

“Throughout May and June, council will hold pop-up education booths at Mudjimba, Twin Waters, Marcoola, Coolum, Currimundi Lake, Ballinger Beach and Golden Beach to promote owner responsibilities,” Cr Johnston said.

“Our community clearly loves animals, with over 43,500 households owning a dog, a cat or both, and we want to work with the community to ensure everyone understands their responsibilities as pet owners.

“Our public spaces are for everyone to enjoy, so it’s important that dog owners are being respectful of others in shared spaces, know where and when their dogs can exercise in public, ensure their dogs are under effective control at all times and their waste is disposed of correctly.”
