Looking for an adventure off the beaten track with plenty of wildlife to spot, but still close to main towns, parks and amenities? This recovering bushland on a slope in the back of Caloundra West (which is a grazing ground for grey kangaroos) is perfect for you!

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers of some experience and mountain bikers. Younger children can also enjoy this short trail if you are happy to take it slow and enjoy each section as it comes. There are other trail options you can explore also.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This important refuge was purchased by Caloundra Council in 2004 to safeguard an important habitat and food source for black cockatoos, the swordgrass brown butterfly, koalas and grey kangaroos.

The park was named in honour of Jill Chamberlain, a local environmental activist who has campaigned for nature cause for over 30 years.

This walk will take you along the western perimeter before entering the bushland (mostly she-oaks) and slowly ascending the hill. You will come out to an open grassy section with powerlines running across it. Here you are likely to see kangaroos grazing. You can continue straight ahead and up to reach Old Caloundra Road. To do the marked route, turn right and head down hill, over some rocky fill and past a palm gully before swinging around to your right and following a path alongside the eastern boundary. You could well see more kangaroos on the fields to your east. The well-worn path leads straight to the metal fence where it’s an easy climb through and short return to your starting point.

**AFTERWARDS**\
From Jill Chamberlain Nature Reserve if you head west along the grasslands you will come to a green parkland corridor that leads south to Canavan Gracie Recreation Park and Little Mountain Common. Caloundra eateries and beaches are only a few kilometres away – a great spot for a dip and bite to eat. Mountain bikers - Sugar Bag Road Mountain Bike Trails are just minutes away with plenty of trails to choose from.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
The Jill Chamberlain Nature Refuge (31.45ha) borders Caloundra Road, approximately 3km west of Caloundra and 6km east of the M1 Caloundra Road turn-off.

While there are multiple entry points, the best place to start is at the end of Winchester Rd. Heading along Caloundra Road turn south into Ridgewood Rd and follow it around the corner and head to the end of the road parking on the side of the road near the gate.

You can also access the reserve from: the top via Old Caloundra Road (runs parallel to Caloundra Road); from west off of Bellvista Road.
