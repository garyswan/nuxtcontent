A land permit is permission from the council to hold events or commercial activities on community land.

Community land includes:

Some things that may require a permit include:

*   Markets
*   Weddings
*   Community film nights
*   Advertising signs
*   Footpath Dining
*   Street stalls
*   Public events.

**Fast Facts:**

*   Over 270 applications for land permits were issued by council in the last quarter of the 2021/22 financial year.
*   Over 1260 applications have been issued in 2022.
*   Council issued over 400 more permits in 2022 than we did in 2021.

This is a great sign that the Sunshine Coast is continuing to enjoy our community spaces.
