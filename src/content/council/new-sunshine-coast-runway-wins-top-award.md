The Sunshine Coast Airport Expansion Project has taken out one of the most prestigious awards in civil infrastructure, the [Civil Contractors Federation QLD (CCF QLD)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/civil-contractors-federation---queensland/)
&#x20;Earth Award for a Queensland project valued above $75 million.

The award recognised the work of Sunshine Coast Council in delivering the $334 million project, alongside contractors John Holland and Beca.

The new international standard runway, with associated taxiways and aprons was completed in January 2021.

The new infrastructure caters for a wider range of aircraft, able to reach a range of international destinations in Asia and the Western Pacific and thus service the air travel and air freight demands of the Sunshine Coast well into the future.

The Sunshine Coast Airport Expansion Project is the single largest civil infrastructure project ever delivered by council and the largest aviation project delivered by any local government in Queensland.

The Civil Contractors Federation Queensland awards celebrate the industry’s achievements by showcasing the high calibre of people and their organisations, along with the outstanding and innovative projects that are completed in Queensland.
