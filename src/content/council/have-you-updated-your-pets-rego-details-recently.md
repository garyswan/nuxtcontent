Sunshine Coast Council has been able to reunite more than 460 animals with their families over the last 12 months – thanks to up-to-date pet registration information.

Making sure we have the most up-to-date information is SO im-paw-tent as it helps council to identify and reunite you with your furry friend if they get lost.

Updating your details or adding a new pet is easy! You can update your details online via [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, email animals\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or call council on 5475 7272.
