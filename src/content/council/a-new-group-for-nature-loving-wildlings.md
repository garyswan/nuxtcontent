Do you need a midweek activity for a wildling in your care?

Join our Whipbird Kindy at the Maroochy Bushland Botanic Garden: an outdoor kindergarten for children aged 3 – 6 years, where kids connect with nature and caregivers don’t stay.

### Join in weekly on Wednesdays from 9.30am - 12.30pm

Each Wednesday morning during school term dates, young children enrolled in the Whipbird Kindy will be immersed in a facilitated program that prioritises child-led, experiential nature connection.

Surrounded by the calming, sensory-rich bushland environment, dedicated kindy leaders will support a safe and welcoming space where children develop environmental awareness, social skills and gross-motor confidence in the Whipbird Village precinct.
