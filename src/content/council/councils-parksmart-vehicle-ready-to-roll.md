A new hybrid parking-monitoring vehicle, equipped with number plate recognition technology, high-speed cameras and a GPS tracking system will soon be trialled at Birtinya, Point Cartwright, Nicklin Way and Caloundra.

During the trial, regulated parking patrols may be carried out by either the ParkSmart vehicle or by one of council’s Regulated Parking Officers.

Sunshine Coast Council Customer Engagement and Planning Services Group Executive Debra Robinson said the new ParkSmart vehicle technology was already in use in other parts of Australia and aimed to encourage vehicle turnover, creating parking opportunities and allowing equitable and safe access to various locations across our region.

“We want our residents and visitors to become familiar with the new approach to patrolling and as a result, it is intended that a four-week education program will start from July 18, when council will issue caution notices rather than infringements,” Ms Robinson said.

“However, if the area has been patrolled by a Regulated Parking Officer, you will receive your infringement notice on your windscreen, which is in line with our current practice.

“Once the education period is over, infringement notices will be issued by post.”

Ms Robinson said the vehicle was clearly marked and the trial was endorsed by council in June 2021 to also provide a safer work environment for parking officers.

“Sadly, many of our officers are at risk of physical and verbal abuse while carrying out their duties when regulating on-street parking or stopping illegal parking,” she said.

“The new ParkSmart vehicle reduces the risk of abuse.”

Signage on how council regulates parking is now in place in these areas to inform residents and visitors of the new system.
