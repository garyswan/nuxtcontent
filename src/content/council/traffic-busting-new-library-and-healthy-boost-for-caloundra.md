Vital transport upgrades, a new heart for Caloundra’s CBD, and improving sport and recreational facilities are key priorities for Division 2 in the Sunshine Coast Council 2023-24 Budget. 

Division 2 encompasses Battery Hill, Caloundra, Caloundra West, Dicky Beach, Golden Beach, Kings Beach, Little Mountain, Moffat Beach, Pelican Waters, Shelly Beach.

Council’s billion-dollar budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better and more sustainable Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said Council would invest in many worthy projects in his area, including more than $22 million for Caloundra’s CBD.

“Funding for the new state-of-the-art [district library](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/major-regional-projects/caloundra-cbd-project/cal-library)
&#x20;and vibrant [creative community hub](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/major-regional-projects/caloundra-cbd-project/create-caloundra)
&#x20;will create a wonderful centrepiece for locals to enjoy, help lift investment confidence and establish Caloundra as a business and cultural and community heart,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Road safety and reducing congestion continues to be a top priority and will see the [Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Caloundra-Transport-Corridor-Upgrade-Project)
&#x20;move into its next phase with more than $5 million invested.”

Council will also contribute more than $8 million towards improving buildings and facilities, including a roof replacement at the Caloundra Indoor Sports Stadium, new field lighting at several sports clubs, plus improved facilities at the Metropolitan Caloundra Surf Life Saving Club at Kings Beach.

“I’m pleased we’re able to bring the works forward to upgrade the switchboard for improved lighting at the Caloundra Rugby Union Club, which supports the highest number of Oztag participants in our state.

“A new surf club facility for our popular surf club at Kings Beach is set to kick-off with $2.2 million to start construction, which will ensure it remains a destination-of-choice for residents and visitors.

“Improvements will also be made to Caloundra Headland Coastal Pathway, Kings Beach thanks to a $2.235 million investment, of which $980,000 will be provided by the State Government’s Local Government Grants and Subsidies Program,” Cr Landsberg said.

Council handed down its 2023-24 budget on June 22, 2023.
