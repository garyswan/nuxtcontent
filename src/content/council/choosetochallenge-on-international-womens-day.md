Heritage Listed Bankfoot House is home to some seriously impressive pioneering women of the past and the ideal setting for an International Women’s Day talk with a fruity twist, on tomorrow, Friday 5 March, 10am – noon.

International Women's Day is on March 8, 2021 and this year’s theme is #ChooseToChallenge.

Dr Amy Clarke, Senior Lecturer in History at the University of the Sunshine Coast, specialises in architectural heritage, identity politics, British colonial and Australian socio-cultural histories and said this year’s theme asked each of us to challenge gender equality.

“I’ll be speaking about the historic lack of representation of women in Australian landscapes,” Dr Clarke said.

“For example there are more statues of large fruits in Australia than of women.

“This is not to enflame men – just to encourage greater reflection on who we champion and celebrate and what we could be doing to add greater diversity to this practice in the future.”

Bankfoot House staff will also share a story of bravery, tenacity and strength that is enduringly compelling—the story of Mary Grigor.

Mary travelled across the world alone – when women really didn’t travel at all, and her entrepreneurial spirit saw her forge her own path, setting up a thriving business.

Against all odds, this ordinary woman left a legacy that we’re still in awe of today. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFSFoFr6CW8>


The event will be live-streamed and available to watch later. Visit <https://www.facebook.com/events/121893396489067>
