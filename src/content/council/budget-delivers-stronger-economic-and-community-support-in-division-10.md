Strong business and community support is at the forefront of Division 10 thanks to Sunshine Coast Council’s 2022–23 Budget with the Nambour Administration Precinct and Namba Place Revitalisation projects at Nambour encouraging economic and social uplift in the hinterland town.\
Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see Nambour featured extensively this year in council’s budget.\
“Nambour’s Namba Place Revitalisation Project has been allocated $300,000, which will see streetscape improvement projects on Currie Street, Howard Street and Mill Street,” Cr Law said.\
“The Nambour Administration Precinct project will receive $750,000 for the feasibility, planning, designing and delivery of projects within the existing precinct to further connect council with the community.

“I’m pleased to see a number of pathways planned in Yandina and Nambour, connecting the hinterland community and improving our active transport connectivity.\
“Road safety improvement will see the Pringle Road intersection at Panorama Drive in Nambour upgraded to clearly define the main throughfare.\
“Kanes Road in Bridges will also be upgraded to a sealed road.\
“Our parks in Obi Obi, Kenilworth, Eerwah Vale, Nambour and North Arm will receive upgrades so our community can continue to enjoy our open spaces, and ensure our youngsters can play safely with playground renewal, carpark construction and fence renewal.\
“Council will also continue implementing elements of the Petrie Creek Parklands masterplan.\
“It’s great to see the continuation and another $100,000 invested in Eumundi’s Town Centre this year, following the completion of community consultation and a $1.5 million commitment last year.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
