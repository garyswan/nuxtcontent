This event is brought to you by the [Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden’s The Backyard Series](https://oursc.com.au/community/events/learn-how-to-create-a-beautiful-native-garden)
.

Native grasses are wonderful for biodiversity and beauty.

In this workshop you'll learn which species perform best in different conditions and for different design effects. Discover how local grasses can be used to create lawns and also how to achieve a 'wildflower meadow look'.

Mid-winter is a great time to take a break from the mowing and consider making changes to your backyard lawn, for aesthetic improvement, higher habitat value and less maintenance!

#### **Date:** Saturday, July 1, 2023

#### **Time**: 10am-12noon

#### **Cost:** $20

#### **Location**: Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden, 51 Palm Creek Road, Tanawha.

#### Registration is limited.
