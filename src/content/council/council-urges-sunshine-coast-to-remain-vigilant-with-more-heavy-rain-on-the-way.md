Sunshine Coast Council has asked residents to stay off the roads if possible, as the community prepares for another deluge, with more rain expected to cross the southeast Queensland coast today and tomorrow (Friday).

After a reprieve overnight, the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast damaging winds, intense rainfall of up to 300mm and the possibility of severe storms to hit the region over the next 24 hours.

With the ground already soaked and waterways swollen, authorities predict more rain could significantly impact areas across the Coast, including flash flooding.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson said now was the time to prepare given the weather forecast.

“Please use this time to plan ahead, stay off the roads where possible and if not, plan for an alternative route home from work or school so you’re not faced with a flooded road later this afternoon and tonight,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I would also ask for the community to stay away from water courses as fast-moving waters can be incredibly treacherous.

“Even a small amount of water on the road is extremely dangerous for you and your passengers, as well as the emergency service workers who may be called to assist you.

“Please stay vigilant and tune into warnings and advice from emergency services and authorities, plus the local emergency broadcaster ABC.

“Remember, if it’s flooded, forget it.”

Mayor Jamieson said council was continuing to deal with the impacts of Tuesday night’s rainfall.

“Council officers and emergency services continue to clear debris, assess damage and monitor road closures,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“There is a range of resources and assistance available through council, emergency services and our recovery agencies for our community.

“I thank them for their continued efforts to keep our community safe.”

The evacuation centre at [Nambour Showgrounds](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Facilities/Nambour-Showgrounds)
 remains open and is able to accept people and animals.

The Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group (LDMG) remains at ‘Stand Up’ and was keeping a close eye on the unfolding situation.

More information and details on road closures can be found on council’s Disaster Hub website: [https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
