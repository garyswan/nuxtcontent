Students from across Australia will swap four wheels for two on Friday 19 March as they pedal, scoot or skate to school for National Ride2School Day.

Ride2School day encourages students to incorporate active travel into their lives and set up lifelong healthy travel habits.

Sunshine Coast Council promotes the event to every school in the local government area and is providing four $500 bike shop vouchers as incentives to encourage as many students as possible to take part.

Transport portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said we all know it’s tough to change the usual way we move around, particularly if it seems to be working. But we also know we should be giving more active travel a go whenever we can. Well here’s a helpful incentive to do just that.

“We want to get as many youngsters riding, skating or scooting to school as possible, so the message to even students who live a fair distance from school is to register and commit to riding even just part of the way,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Choosing active travel over sitting in traffic in a private vehicle even for just one day a week is a great way to build sustainable, healthy, lifelong habits that are good for you and good for the planet.

“Parents and caregivers can find information and useful resources on how to ‘active travel’ to school on the [active school travel](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Roads-and-Transport/Active-School-Travel)
 pages on council’s website.

“Our region has an ever increasing pathway network with over 1,400 kilometres of sealed pathways and we’re moving as quickly as possible on pathway network improvements, with an emphasis on those around school precincts.”

Participants must [register](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07ehj2hjzm0497fd55&oseq=&c=&ch=)
 before 5pm on Friday 19 March to enter the draw for a chance to win. 

Prize winners must be school-aged children attending a school in the Sunshine Coast Regional Council area, be registered for council's prize draw and travel to school by riding, scooting, skating or walking on Friday 19 March 2021.
