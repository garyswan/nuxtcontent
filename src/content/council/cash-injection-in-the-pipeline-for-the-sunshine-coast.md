A $9.03 million funding injection will kick-start 16 projects worth more than $22 million across the Sunshine Coast to improve parks, streetscapes and sporting facilities, provide new playgrounds and generate local jobs sooner than planned.

The Queensland Government funding is in addition to the $268 million worth of projects announced in Sunshine Coast Council’s 2021/2022 [budget](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Budget-Financial-and-Annual-Reports/Budget)
&#x20;last month and is matched by $13.4 million council funding to deliver these projects over the next three years.

The funding is a share in the Queensland Government’s $100 million South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the upgrades would provide important infrastructure and facilities to meet our community’s needs.

“The projects, which will be delivered through this funding package, will provide widespread benefit to residents across our region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This funding will enable these projects to be delivered sooner which is a great outcome for our community while also providing further stimulus to our local economy by creating work across a variety of trades and services.”

Deputy Premier and Minister for Local Government Steven Miles said the SEQ Community Stimulus Program was part of Queensland’s COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan and the projects would make a positive impact on communities.

“There’s no doubt these projects will produce enormous benefits by creating employment opportunities and improving liveability across the Sunshine Coast,” Mr Miles said.

“More than 300 jobs will be created or supported through delivering these projects, which is a great result for local families.

“Investing in infrastructure that will improve communities and create local jobs is part of the government’s Economic Recovery Plan.”

The SEQCSP-funded projects within the Sunshine Coast local government area include the following, by division and suburb.

**DIVISION 1 BEERWAH AND LANDSBOROUGH PROJECTS**

*$500,000 toward the Stage 2 Cribb Street Streetscape Project, Landsborough*

*$200,000 toward further implementation of the Beerwah Place Masterplan at Turner Park, Beerwah*

Continuing the Landsborough Streetscape project and upgrading Turner Park are now in the pipeline.

Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said both projects would feature valuable community enhancements.

“The $200,000 Turner Park upgrades will include improved pathways and landscaping as well as recreational infrastructure and space,” Cr Baberowski said.

“I also look forward to the $500,000 investment in streetscape improvements at Landsborough which focus on the park side of Cribb Street and are an important part of the multi-stage Landsborough Placemaking Master Plan.

“This will complement work completed in Stage 1 and continues to deliver a streetscape designed with community feedback, featuring seating, shelters and arbours, as well as lighting and associated landscaping which will create a cooler and more shady street with improved access and more street activation.”

**DIVISION 2 CALOUNDRA PROJECT**

*$700,000 to support the roof upgrade at the Caloundra Indoor Stadium, Golden Beach*

The Caloundra Indoor Stadium at Golden Beach will benefit from a $700,000 roof upgrade.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said it was imperative to keep the region’s only four-court multi-purpose air-conditioned stadium structure solid.

“The Caloundra Indoor Stadium is a much-loved sporting asset and hosts a wide range of events, from local fixtures to national level tournaments as well as expos, trade shows, conferences and community events,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Improving this facility will enable us to continue attracting popular events at a state and national level as well as supporting our local fixtures.”

**DIVISION 3 BOKARINA PROJECT**

*$500,000 towards construction of a car park on Sportsman’s Parade at the Sunshine Coast Stadium, Bokarina*

To meet the needs of our growing community and the increasing popularity of the Sunshine Coast Stadium, $500,000 has been granted towards the construction of a car park on Sportsman’s Parade at Bokarina.

Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said 180 car park spaces, wayfinding signage, boom gate access control, precinct pathway connections, fencing and a drop off area for public transport would improve access to the facility.

“We’ve seen sell-out crowds at this much-loved stadium, most recently for the Women’s State of Origin clash on 25 June, so it’s critical that our stadium can accommodate the additional people choosing to live on our Sunshine Coast,” Cr Cox said.

**DIVISION 4** **MOOLOOLABA, MINYAMA AND MAROOCHYDORE PROJECTS**

*$2.02 million as a major funding boost to deliver the Major Streetscaping Upgrade of First Avenue, Maroochydore*

*$215,000 to assist construction of new facilities at Outrigger Park, Minyama*

*$100,000 to support shade provision at the Stage 1 Mooloolaba Foreshore Northern Parkland, Mooloolaba*

The Mooloolaba Foreshore Northern Parkland will receive $100,000 for shading; $215,000 will provide amenities at Outrigger Park, Minyama; and $145,000 will provide pedestrian facilities at Parkyn Parade, Mooloolaba.

A further $2.02 million funding will be invested in the Major Streetscape Upgrade at First Avenue, Maroochydore.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said he was pleased the First Avenue upgrade at Maroochydore made the cut.

“This project’s funding is particularly exciting and is part of $26 million distributed by the State Government on a competitive application basis,” Cr Natoli said.

“The First Avenue Streetscape Project will upgrade a critical physical connection, while providing economic and social revitalisation within Maroochydore.

“It will create a revitalised, appealing, accessible and safe streetscape setting for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as nearby businesses and services.

“The Mooloolaba Foreshore Northern Parkland project will receive $100,000 for shade cover, an important component for safe sun-smart play areas in our harsh environment.

“Outrigger Park, Minyama will receive $215,000 to assist construction of new facilities and $145,000 will be invested in pedestrian facilities at Arthur Parkyn Park and Penny Lane on Parkyn Parade, Mooloolaba.

“This is a very busy road, especially during the warmer months, so these upgrades will go a long way to improving pedestrian safety on Parkyn Parade.”

**DIVISION 5 PALMWOODS AND WOOMBYE PROJECTS**

*$500,000 contribution toward Woombye Placemaking – Blackall Street Streetscape Project, providing a range of streetscape enhancements for Woombye*

Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston welcomed the funding which includes $500,000 for the Woombye streetscape enhancements and $450,000 will benefit Palmwoods footy fans and players.

“The $500,000 investment will go a long way in restoring Woombye’s rich history and charm,” Cr Johnston said.

“We aren’t looking to change Woombye’s identity, instead enhance what the community already loves about the lively township by providing a range of streetscape improvements.

“Meanwhile, the Palmwoods Warriors Football Club upgrades will include new amenities, a meeting space and a canteen and help protect against flooding.”

**DIVISION 6 SIPPY DOWNS PROJECT**

*$600,000 to support construction of Stage 2 of the Albany Lakes Park Playground, Sippy Downs*

Consultation with the Sippy Downs community through the Sippy Downs Parks Master Plan in 2018 showed overwhelming support for a new playground at Albany Lakes Park, with more play opportunities and better car parking.

And now, their vision is becoming a reality.

Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said $600,000 was a significant funding injection to support construction of Stage 2 of the Albany Lakes Park Playground, Sippy Downs.

“I’m pleased that Stage 1 works on both play space and carpark upgrades will wrap up in coming months,” Cr Dickson said.

“This extra funding will allow us to start on Stage 2 which includes feature playground equipment with multiple large shade sails, a large picnic shelter, barbecue and drinking fountain.

“Once complete, I’m sure the community will be eager to bring their children to the park and let little legs run wild.”

**DIVISION 7 BUDERIM** **PROJECT**

*$700,000 towards new major playground facilities at Buderim Village Park, Buderim*

The new major playground at Buderim Village Park, on the corner of Church and King streets, Buderim, will progress thanks to a $700,000 funding injection.

Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford welcomed the funding and said it would further enhance council’s vision for the new park as a place of nature, recreation and to be enjoyed by everyone in the community.

“Council purchased the 3.4ha piece of land in 2010 to develop it into an open, green, district level park,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Extensive consultation was undertaken providing the community the opportunity to share ideas and help shape the vision for the park which then formed the draft landscape concept plan.

“I look forward to providing updates to our community as the design progresses.”

**DIVISION 8 MAROOCHYDORE AND MUDJIMBA PROJECTS**

*$700,000 to support construction of new change rooms and amenities at the North Shore Multi-Sports Complex, Mudjimba*

*$500,000 towards Ocean Street Streetscape renewal and upgrade works, Maroochydore*

A total of $1.2 million dollars will be invested in Division 8 for streetscape renewals and upgrades to Ocean Street, Maroochydore as well as supporting infrastructure at North Shore Multi-Sports Complex.

Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said $700,000 had been allocated for improvements at the popular North Shore Multi-Sports Complex.

“The funding will go towards constructing new change rooms and an amenity block, which I’m sure our sports stars will warmly welcome,” Cr O’Pray said.

“It’s infrastructure like this which encourages a healthy region and provides opportunities and possibilities for our rising sports stars.

“A further $500,000 has been allocated towards Ocean Street – a cultural destination within Maroochydore, providing food and dining, festivals, live music and cultural activities.

“Upgrades to structures, street furniture and signage and will create a more inviting streetscape and help foster economic confidence into the future.”

**DIVISION 9 COOLUM PROJECT**

*$700,000 towards upgrading the Coolum Sports Complex access road intersection with David Low Way, Coolum*

The Coolum Sports Complex intersection, Coolum will receive $700,000 towards David Low Way access.

Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said she was looking forward to seeing the intersection upgraded, which would improve driver safety when cars left the sporting facilities.

“Considering the location, close proximity to schools and high usage of the complex, upgrading the intersection for Coolum Sports Complex has been a priority project for the Coolum community,” Cr Maria said.

“It’s especially important to also provide safe crossing points for those who ride or walk and parents who drop off and pick up their children accessing the popular sports complex.”

**DIVISION 10 EUMUNDI PROJECT**

*$500,000 contribution towards Eumundi Placemaking project, providing a range of streetscape enhancements in Eumundi*

Eumundi’s Memorial Drive will receive a $500,000 injection to deliver streetscape improvements.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said the streetscape project was about enhancing those aspects locals already loved about Eumundi’s main street.

“This announcement is very exciting for our community, as council has been working with local businesses and organisations to find out their values and vision for the main street,” Cr Law said.

“A draft streetscape design will be presented over the coming months as part of Stage 2’s – ‘Have we got it right’ with an opportunity for the community to provide further feedback.

“I look forward to releasing more information very soon.”
