The inspiration behind the Sunshine Coast City Hall’s design – the hinterland’s majestic Glass House Mountains – is now becoming evident as the building's exterior is gradually unveiled.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said Maroochydore City Centre’s landmark building had reached another important construction milestone with the tower crane dismantled and all external scaffolding scheduled to be removed over the coming days.

“The similarities to the Glass House Mountains can now be seen in the architects’ use of the mountains’ forms and colours, the stepped roof and curved facade and the tower of native species gradually being planted,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“And, in a further nod to nature, residents, visitors and staff will experience the mountain and water themes as they flow from the exterior inwards.

“I encourage our community to take a look at council’s new video which reveals how the Glasshouse Mountains inspired our City Hall’s design.”

Mayor Jamieson said while the tower crane had been removed and scaffolding was coming down, there was still much work to be completed.

“This includes public art and landscaping which will create attractive spaces linking the City Hall building with its surroundings in Australia’s newest CBD,” he said.

Other works on the external façade and ground level streetscape are progressing at a rapid pace.

Fit-out on a number of floors will be completed in the coming weeks, ready for furniture, audio visual and IT equipment installation in the coming months.

Sunshine Coast City Hall is expected to be open late 2022.
