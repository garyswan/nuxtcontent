Affordable and environmentally friendly transport is coming to the Sunshine Coast with Council announcing the successful applicant for an electric scooter and bike trial.

Council received four Expression of Interest submissions, with Neuron Mobility Pty Ltd the successful operator. All EOI submissions demonstrated an encouraging level of interest in the trial program.

Neuron Mobility’s proposal stood out for their level of service, their understanding of the unique requirements of the Sunshine Coast market and their commitments to safety and community engagement.

Neuron Mobility e-scooter and bike.

Neuron Mobility is one of Australia’s leading e-mobility share program providers with significant experience nationally and in Queensland, operating in Brisbane, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Townsville, and Yeppoon.

Neuron Mobility Regional Manager Tim Morris said the company was delighted to have been chosen by Sunshine Coast Council.

“e-scooters and e-bikes are really well suited to Maroochydore and Mooloolaba and will be a great way for locals and tourists to travel in a safe, convenient and environmentally friendly way,’’ Mr Morris said.

“Safety is our top priority; it dictates our e-scooter and e-bike design and also the way we operate them.

“Both are packed with a range of cutting-edge safety features and we know from experience in other cities, that riders really appreciate this.”

Neuron Mobility will now undertake community education and awareness campaigns to promote safe e-bike and e-scooter use, including ‘share the path’ initiatives.

Operation of the eco-friendly trial will begin in the Mooloolaba and Maroochydore area this June.

Neuron Mobility will launch in June with 50% of their e-scooter and e-bike fleet. A total of 400 e-scooters and 75 e-bikes will be available by the end of June, 2023. 

Neuron Mobility will educate riders on riding rules to ensure all users of Neuron electric bikes and scooters adhere to the road rules and comply with all other Department of Transport and Main Roads requirements.
