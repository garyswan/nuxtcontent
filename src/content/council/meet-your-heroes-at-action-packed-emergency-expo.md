If you’ve ever wanted to watch a helicopter water bombing, see firefighters respond to a blaze or observe a mock crash scene rescue, be sure not to miss the Emergency Services and Disaster Preparedness Expo.

This family-friendly event will be held at the Sunshine Coast Stadium on Sunday 30 May from 10am to 2pm.

The renowned Queensland Police Pipes and Drums will be keeping the crowd entertained and you can even step inside impressive emergency service vehicles, plus so much more.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson today launched the event alongside emergency services representatives who have partnered with council to deliver the expo.

“As we know all too well here on the Sunshine Coast, disaster can strike anytime and anywhere,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“No one is immune, so the best thing you can do is ensure you, your family and neighbours know exactly what to do when faced with a disaster or emergency.

“The expo will offer people of all ages the opportunity to both learn how to prepare for emergencies and see first-hand how emergency services personnel respond when the worst happens.

“As well as all the exciting demonstrations, there will be stalls hosted by council and the emergency services where you can collect stamps on a passport and go in the draw to win some fantastic prizes.”

Mayor Jamieson said the expo was also a great opportunity to meet and thank emergency services workers for their efforts in keeping our community safe.

“When severe storms strike, fires rage, tragic road incidents occur, and even throughout the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, during the most difficult of times our emergency services are there for us. 

“Don’t miss this chance to get a better understanding of how they work and what you can do to support them – all while having a fun day out with your family.”

Attendees will also have the chance to vote for their favourite finalist in the award-winning Sunshine Coast Get Ready Schools Competition, which challenges primary-school students to create a 30-second video highlighting the importance of having a “WHAT-IF-PLAN” so everyone knows what to do when disaster strikes.
