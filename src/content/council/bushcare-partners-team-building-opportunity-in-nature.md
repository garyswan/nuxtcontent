This year, exercise your team’s green thumb and book a team building activity with BushCare Partners.

BushCare Partners has been working with corporate organisations and volunteers for over 20 years and uses bushcare and tree planning activities for organisations to:

*   work on their team building and culture
*   inspire individual development
*   get outdoors and away from the desk
*   stay healthy and active
*   connect with nature
*   make a positive impact on the environment

Corporate volunteer teams have planted over 22,000 trees, removed environmental weeds and helped local BushCare Community groups restore numerous sites across the region.

Projects can be tailored to suit your organisation’s needs. This can range from regular smaller group involvement to larger one-off days or sponsorship.

Learn more about BushCare Partners on council's [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Get-Involved-in-Conservation/BushCare-Sunshine-Coast/BushCare-Partners)
