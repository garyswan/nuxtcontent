February is when our first turtle hatchling emerges from its nest beneath the sand.

Before that happens, Sunshine Coast Council is calling on our community to come together to tidy up their local beach as part of the 9th annual Clean up for the Hatchlings event on Saturday, February 4, 2023.

Sunshine Coast Council is proudly running this event in partnership with TurtleCare Sunshine Coast, [Reef Check Australia](https://www.facebook.com/reefcheckaustralia/)
, [Unitywater](https://www.facebook.com/Unitywater/)
, [SEA LIFE Sunshine Coast Aquarium](https://www.facebook.com/sealifesunshinecoast/)
&#x20;and Noosa Council.

Volunteers can register now to pick up litter at various beach locations across the Sunshine Coast from 6am to 7.30am.

From 8am, participants are invited to Coopers Lookout Park, south of the Kawana Surf Club, to enjoy a free barbecue, participate in a prize draw and other fun activities and, most importantly, to weigh and sort the collected debris.

The event will be single-use plastic-free, so make sure you bring a reusable water bottle, coffee cup and gloves, as well enclosed footwear, and sun protection.

Sunshine Coast hatchlings.

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said that while every day could be a beach clean-up day, he was delighted to see our community come together to help protect these threatened species every year.

“We are a turtle-friendly community on the Sunshine Coast and this is our chance to make a difference to our threatened turtle hatchlings,” Cr Cox said.
