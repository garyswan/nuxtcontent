Great news for budding photographers or aspiring David Attenboroughs, the deadline for the Sunshine Coast Biosphere Photography competition has been extended to midnight Sunday, October 9.

And by sharing a high-res snap of a native plant, insect, landscape or connection between people and the natural environment, entrants could potentially win a share in a prize pool of $3500\*.

This initiative is to celebrate International Day of Biosphere Reserves in November.

Creative efforts will be rewarded with selected photographs curated into a special showcase which includes an exhibition that can be viewed during November, and the chance to win a share in an award prize pool of $3500\*.
