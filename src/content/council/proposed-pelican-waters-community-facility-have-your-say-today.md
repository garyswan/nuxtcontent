Residents are invited to have their say on a proposed community facility in Pelican Waters.

Sunshine Coast Council is seeking to understand the need and demand for a facility at Spitfire Banks Drive in Pelican Waters near the soon-to-be developed [Pelican Waters Marina](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/New-marina-for-the-Sunshine-Coast-anchors-major-benefits-for-boaties-and-businesses-230322)

The proposed location for a community facility at Spitfire Banks Drive in Pelican Waters

A series of engagement activities has been planned throughout May, including a pop-up engagement activity, an online survey and a virtual and in-person community workshop.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said council wanted to hear from

residents and community groups, to find out how useful a new community facility would be in Pelican Waters.

“We want to understand the need for a community facility, and the activities that should be on offer at a future facility,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Community facilities can provide spaces for a wide range of community uses such as meetings, social gatherings, or recreational, educational, artistic, and cultural activities.

“Feedback will allow council to plan more effectively by responding to community need rather than duplicating what is already on offer.

“A variety of community engagement activities has been organised so residents can get involved in the way that best suits them.

“During this process, we’ll also aim to identify opportunities such as potential partnerships and funding sources.”

Residents can register to attend an online workshop on Monday, May 9, or attend an in-person community workshop at Caloundra Power Boat Club on Wednesday, May 11. Please register your attendance or complete the survey via council’s [Have Your Say page](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/pelican-waters-comm-facility)
.

A pop-up engagement activity will also be held at Scribbly Gum Park, Pelican Waters on Wednesday, May 11, from 4-6pm. “Be sure to attend one of our engagement activities or provide your feedback online by May 23,” Cr Landsberg said.
