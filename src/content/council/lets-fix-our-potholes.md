The recent deluge and minor flooding across our region has prompted renewed calls for our community to dob in a pothole or report damaged roads.

Sunshine Coast Council crews and contractors have been busy clearing debris and assessing our roads to make sure they are safe.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged the community to be our eyes and ears in locating damaged roads which had emerged after the recent weather.

“Since the February weather event and the more recent heavy rain this month, some of our roads have been significantly impacted,” Cr Law said.

“We always appreciate the community’s assistance is locating and alerting us to any repairs needed, especially on local residential streets.

“Before you report potholes or damages, please firstly check if the road is owned by the local council road or the State Government. You can quickly check this by visiting [Queensland Traffic Road Lookup](https://qldtraffic.qld.gov.au/lookup.html)
&#x20;website which tells you if you should contact council or the Department of Transport and Main Roads.   

“This step before you submit your request will ensure the repair job is directed to the correct road owner to get the job done quickly!”

To report a pothole on a Council road, visit Council’s website at [sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council)
, where you can lodge an eRequest online, phone 5475 7272 or alternatively email Customer.Service\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.

To report a pothole on state-controlled roads, please contact the Department of Transport and Main Roads on 07 5451 7055 or email northcoast\@tmr.qld.gov.au.

A list of state-controlled roads across our region is available at [qldtraffic.qld.gov.au/lookup.html](https://qldtraffic.qld.gov.au/lookup.html)
