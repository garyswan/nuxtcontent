Single, doubles or queens – it’s time to dig deep into the depths of your linen cupboard to give those old sheets a second chance at life.

To celebrate World Environment Day, [Sunshine Coast Council](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/18407924-a/give-a-sheet-for-the-planet)
&#x20;and [Noosa Council](https://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/events/event/454/give-a-sheet-for-the-planet-linen-and-clothing-collection)
&#x20;have teamed up with [BlockTexx](https://www.blocktexx.com/)
&#x20;and [St Vincent de Paul Society](https://www.vinnies.org.au/)
&#x20;to hold a community textile recycling event, ‘Give a Sheet® for the Planet’.

Simply clean out your linen cupboards and drop-off approved items at [Chancellor State College, Secondary Campus, Sippy Downs Drive, Sippy Downs](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/18407924-a/give-a-sheet-for-the-planet)
&#x20;or [Tewantin State School, 10 Werin Street, Tewantin](https://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/events/event/454/give-a-sheet-for-the-planet-linen-and-clothing-collection)
, on June 11.

All donated linen will be converted into valuable, high-grade recycled materials by BlockTexx to be used by Australian manufacturers to create new products. These include hydro-mulch, geosynthetic fabrics and building materials.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Holder Cr Maria Suarez said the event was a great way to clean out the closet and recycle for the environment.

“An average household is estimated to have around 20kg of old linen stashed in their cupboards,” said Cr Suarez.

“Often this linen ends up as unusable donations or landfill.

“Give a Sheet® for the planet will allow for tonnes of old unwanted sheets, towels, pillowcases and other household textiles to be given a new life.

“Just one truck load of linen collected will have diverted 10 tonnes of textile waste from landfill and will have removed carbon emissions equivalent to taking 60 cars off the road for a year.

“This event gives the community a convenient way to do their part in creating a cleaner, greener environment and sustainable future, all while winning back some space in their cupboards.”

Noosa Mayor Clare Stewart said Noosa Council was proud to spearhead the inaugural Give a Sheet® textile collection initiative with BlockTexx in 2022.

“We asked Noosa residents and businesses to ‘give a sheet’ in support of reducing textile waste.

“The community rallied around the cause with over 200 donations dropped off, helping to divert 3.2 tonnes of textile waste from landfill.

“This initiative is not only a win for the environment but is also creating new resources for other sectors and helping Councils deliver on their commitments to the circular economy in a measurable, tangible way.”

### **Australian-first initiative**

Co-founder of BlockTexx Adrian Jones said the community feedback was always extremely positive.

“Everyone seems to have a ‘thank goodness you’re here’ moment when they realise that our onshore recycling option is a better alternative than landfill or export,” Mr Jones said.

“This state-of-the-art textile recovery facility developed in Australia will break down textiles into new recycled materials of rPET pellets and Cellulose clay to be used by Australian manufacturers – they won’t be going into landfill, burnt, or exported overseas.

“Being able to access a commercial-scale circular economy solution for textile waste, diverting it from kerbside bins and landfill, right here on the Sunshine Coast, is remarkable.”
