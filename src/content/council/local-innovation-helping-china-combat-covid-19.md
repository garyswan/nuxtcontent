Ozzi Kleen’s Containerised Transportable Wastewater Treatment Plant helped the Suqian Infectious Disease Hospital, approximately 700km north-east of Wuhan disinfect its wastewater to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ozzi Kleen’s plant provided an extra disinfection process to remove the risk of the virus leaving the hospital via liquid waste streams.

A local Chinese team was guided through the installation process remotely via WeChat with the help of a translator.

Ozzi Kleen began exporting to China under a $9 billion China Ministry for Environment program.

The program aims to reduce wastewater impacts on farmlands, channels and the underground water table in rural areas without adequate sewerage treatment processes.

An initial system was shipped to China in late December 2019 but had not yet been installed when the COVID-19 outbreak started.

The system was reconfigured to deal with the infectious waste at the specialist hospital, which was last used during the SARS outbreak over 17 years ago.
