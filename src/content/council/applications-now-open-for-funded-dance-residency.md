Contemporary dance artists from across Australia are invited to submit expressions of interest for a funded residency on the Sunshine Coast.

The residency is offered by ArtsCoast, Sunshine Coast Council’s arts platform, in partnership with dance theatre company L.J.Projects.

The successful dance artist will receive three weeks studio space in Council’s 2nd Space dance studio, Nambour; a contribution towards expenses of $8000 and local industry support.

Applications for residency, which takes place in June, can be made online by April 18.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the residency was just one of the initiatives offered through council’s three-year [DANCE.HERE.NOW](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Arts-and-Culture/Arts-programs-and-initiatives/Dance-Development)
&#x20;program, which aimed to strengthen the region’s dance sector,” Cr Baberowski said.

“We’re looking to build the capacity and recognition of local artists as well as encourage new dance artists to the Sunshine Coast.

“The aim is to support artists to test, develop and realise ideas and build connections within and beyond the region for sector sustainability.

“Artists will collaborate with Sunshine Coast based artists, host open classes and present a small industry-showing on completion of the residency.”

Sunshine Coast Council’s Creative Development leader Megan Rowland said the residency was open to individual artists or collectives nationally with a professional contemporary dance practice.

 “We’re particularly interested in artists who are embracing digital and emerging technologies in their practice and inter-disciplinary artists” Ms Rowland said.

“First Nations dance practitioners are encouraged to apply, with priority given to Kabi Kabi and Jinibara artists.
