The annual Sunshine Coast Council pet registration period is coming up in September so now is the perfect time to make sure your pet’s details are up to date.

If you have moved to a new house, your pet has recently been desexed or microchipped or your pet has sadly passed away, it’s important to ensure council has the correct details before registration renewals are sent out late August.

Registration costs just $15 if your dog or cat is desexed and microchipped and it’s free, if you have a current pensioner card.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said pet registration was a key part of being a responsible pet owner.

“Making sure your pet is registered and microchipped, and its details are up to date, helps council get your pet get back home quickly if it roams from your property,” Cr Johnston said.

“There are more than 60,000 pets registered in the Sunshine Coast Council region and the registration information also helps us to provide pet-related services, such as dog off-leash parks, where they are needed most.”

You can update or cancel your pet’s registration details via the simple online form on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;by searching “[Cat and dog registration](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Cat-and-Dog-Registration/Updating-Registration-Details)
”.  

You can also Register with [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mycouncil)
 to update any of the following animal details:

*   pensioner details
*   desexing
*   microchipping
*   status of your animal
*   request a replacement tag

A full list of pet registration fees can be found on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Fees-and-Charges)
