The 30-year-old deteriorating Maroochy Waters pontoon has been refreshed and ready for your kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding pleasure, thanks to a recent upgrade by Sunshine Coast Council.

The upgrade includes an innovative new four metre kayak step for better access onto the water.

It sits just above the water to try and make it easier for users launching craft from the pontoon and works by reducing the step down from the pontoon deck onto a kayak and vice versa.

We’ve also oiled the viewing deck, added new balustrades, replaced the pontoon and piles, and removed the lower ‘jetty’ to accommodate a new longer gangway.

The new pontoon has been designed with our community in mind, for improved and safer access to the canal and Maroochy River for non-motorised water sports.

The kayak step is a new design, and any feedback is welcome to CoastalandCanals\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.

Maroochy Waters pontoon is located at 51 Maroochy Waters Drive - opposite Henley Park, between Portland Quay and Plymouth Quay.
