Did you know putting small branches into your garden organics bin before grass clippings prevents grass sticking to the bottom?  

From waste to resource, [a new video](https://youtu.be/XJMfmIr9T6k)
 shares this top tip and more on how to get the best from your household garden organics bin.

Sunshine Coast residents are invited to watch a waste education expert share her recycling knowledge.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Holder Cr Maria Suarez said remembering what goes in your garden organics bin was really very simple.

“If it grows in your garden, it can go in the bin,” Cr Suarez.

“And that’s the extent of it – please only put grass clippings, small branches and twigs, leaves, non-invasive weeds, garden prunings and old flowers in your garden bin.”

[The video](https://youtu.be/XJMfmIr9T6k)
, shares top tips and takes viewers behind the scenes to give an insight into what happens to their garden organics once it’s collected by council.

When you recycle your garden waste, it gets turned into mulch – creating new life from old.

Once collected, our region’s garden organics are taken to a council resource recovery centre to be processed.

The material is ground into a mulch and placed in windrows to ‘age’.

This mulch is available to our community to place in their gardens. Check Council’s website for availability before you visit a site.

*Check on council's website if mulch is available before you come*

Cr Suarez thanked the community for embracing the expanded garden organics service.

“From July to October 2022, since the expanded service began, more than 6300 tonnes of kerbside-collected garden organics have been diverted from landfill, recycled and reused,” Cr Suarez said.

“Our Sunshine Coast community has really taken up the chance to help our environment by using the fortnightly garden organics bin to divert more waste from landfill and prevent harmful greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere.

“A total of 86,000 households now have a garden organics bin with an extra 45,000 joining the service since the expanded program began on July 11, 2022.

“We have a goal to be a zero net emissions organisation and low carbon region and decomposing waste is a big contributor to greenhouse gases.

Recycling garden organics is good for our environment

“The more organic material we put into landfill, the more greenhouse gases we produce over the long term and the worse it is for the environment.

“We thank our community for playing their part for a cleaner, greener environment and sustainable future.”

*   Coarse mulch is available at most Sunshine Coast waste facilities. Check stock availability and quantity limits by searching ‘ coarse mulch’ at sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.
*   The expanded garden organics service began on July 11, 2022, with an extra 45,000 households joining the service.
*   Community feedback received in February 2021 from 7,500 residents regarding the future management of Sunshine Coast waste revealed overwhelming support for expanding the garden organics service to contribute to a better and more sustainable future.
*   The garden organics bin is the first step towards implementing a future Food Organics and Garden Organics bin service.
*   Mulching and reusing garden waste, instead of dumping it, will extend our landfill life and reduce greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.
*   It could also potentially save property owners paying the full cost of the Queensland Government Waste Levy.
