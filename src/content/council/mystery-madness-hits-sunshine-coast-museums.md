Sunshine Coast Council and Community museums have teamed up to offer a month of mystery madness.

Visit your local museum in September to test your powers of observation and complete a fun-filled quiz for a chance to win a prize.

The  special quiz is now  available to visitors at [Buderim Pioneer Cottage](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Places/Museums/Buderim-Pioneer-Cottage)
, [Landsborough Museum](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Places/Museums/Landsborough-Museum)
&#x20;and [Nambour Museum](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Places/Museums/Nambour-and-District-Historical-Museum)
, adding an extra element of intrigue to the visitor experience.

Your observation skills will be put to the test as you search to fill in the missing gaps. It could be a name of a train, what was used to fuel stoves or finding phones that have no numbers - each museum’s quiz is different.

And the effort is worth it with a $100 Caloundra Regional Gallery Shop gift voucher up for grabs – a great way to support local artisans.

All entrants will receive a free pocket magnifier to solve problems and discover the Sunshine Coast’s amazing heritage.

Visitors can enter one or all three museum quizzes and become a Museum VIP with a discount card.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the initiative was a fabulously fun way to promote Sunshine Coast museums.

"These places have remarkable collections. Each time you visit, you see and experience something different,” Cr Baberowski said.

“It could be as nostalgic as a toy steam train, romantic as an Edison Phonograph or as muscular as a cane train. No matter what it is, each display tells us something more about how our regional communities lived and progressed.

“The museums make for an exceptional low-cost day out during the school holidays and the quiz offers families a way to explore our incredible heritage in a fun, meaningful and even more rewarding way.”

The program runs throughout September until the end of the school holidays on 3 October 2021.
