Flooding across the Sunshine Coast has resulted in significant damage to roads and public assets across the region and recovery and rectification works are now underway.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson said due to the extent of damage, road and infrastructure repairs would take weeks and, in some cases, months to assess, prioritise and complete.

“Authorities are reminding the Sunshine Coast community that while the wet weather may have eased, parts of our region remain flooded, with many roads still closed or partly closed and needing major repairs.

“People are asked to avoid unnecessary travel and we ask them to be patient as crews assess and prioritise repairs across the region. 

“Landslips can occur for weeks to come so if you are on the roads, please be aware of that risk and always observe and follow any signage displayed.

“Recovering from these severe weather events continues for a long time after the immediate threat passes.

“Make safety your number one priority and remember, if it’s flooded, forget it.”

Mayor Jamieson thanked the many volunteers, emergency workers and council staff who had worked long shifts over many days and continued to support the Sunshine Coast during the recovery phase.

“For days they have put the community above their own needs and gone above and beyond to help others and keep our region as safe as possible,” he said.

“I know that the SES has managed 1000 calls over the past few days, and have done a magnificent job, with only 41 jobs outstanding at 1pm today.”

Mayor Jamieson also praised the Sunshine Coast community for their kindness and resilience during this weather event.
