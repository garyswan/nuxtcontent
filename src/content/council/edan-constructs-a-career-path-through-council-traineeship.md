This time last year Mount Coolum resident Edan Wilson wasn’t sure which career road he wanted to venture down.

Now the 19-year-old is helping build roads, while earning a wage and completing a Certificate II in Civil Construction through a Sunshine Coast Council traineeship.

“I never really knew what I wanted to do prior to starting this traineeship,” Edan said.

“It has given me insights into what I want to do and what my career path is, and I think I’ve found that with council so it’s really benefitting me.

“I was doing a bit of landscaping after leaving school and my Aunt suggested I have a go at a council traineeship, so I applied and started in May last year in civil construction as a civil field worker.

“Every day is a highlight because it’s a learning opportunity and I learn something new daily.

“I’d love to earn a fulltime job with council as an operator or a labourer and work my way up.

“I’m so glad that I took the leap and went for this traineeship and my advice to anyone who isn’t sure what they want to do career wise is to just go for it. If you’re scared to do it, that’s the perfect time to just jump in and try your luck!”

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said applications for 2022 traineeships open from April 8 and a diverse range of opportunities within council were available for people of all ages and backgrounds.

“I urge anyone who lives on the Sunshine Coast and has limited work experience and qualifications to take this opportunity,” Cr Hungerford said.

“This year, council is offering traineeships in civil construction, horticulture, business administration and conservation and land management. 

“Edan is a terrific example of what council traineeships have done for so many young people. Our trainees are paid to learn on-the-job for 12 months and complete a certificate qualification in their field, so it’s a great starting point for fulfilling career.”
