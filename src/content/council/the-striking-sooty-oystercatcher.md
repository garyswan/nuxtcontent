The Sooty Oystercatcher is one of two oystercatchers found on the Sunshine Coast. The large black resident shorebirds with the bright red bill, red eyes and pink legs are easy to identify. They are endemic to Australia, meaning they donâ€™t live anywhere else. Sooty Oystercatchers forage for molluscs along the rocky foreshore and are frequently sighted on all rocky headlands on the Sunshine Coast.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
