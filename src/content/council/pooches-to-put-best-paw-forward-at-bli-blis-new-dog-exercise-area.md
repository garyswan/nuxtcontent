A new fenced dog off-leash area will soon be installed at Muller Park, Bli Bli. Located along Maroochy River, the 3.6-hectare Sunshine Coast Council district park is increasingly popular and much loved by the Sunshine Coast community.

Growing demand resulted in council undertaking community consultation to better understand how to make the park accessible, user-friendly and safer, for all users.

The inclusion of a fenced dog off-leash area follows a community consultation process which resulted in 204 surveys completed and a community meeting to hear from a further 40 community members sharing their valuable local knowledge, thoughts and ideas.

The dog off-leash area will be installed at the northern end of the park and will include seating, rubbish bin, water tap and shade trees.

Sunshine Coast divisional councillor Maria Suarez said community feedback received in October 2019 indicated that the majority of the surrounding community supported the introduction of a fenced dog off-leash area and support for dogs to be allowed off-leash within the wider park after 4pm and before 8am.

“Feedback shows our community has strong opinions on dog facilities,” Cr Suarez said.

“It’s great to see the passion when it comes to looking after our health and for our dogs too – that’s what makes us a healthy, smart and creative region.

“After 4pm and before 8am, dogs can be off-leash anywhere in the park except the playground and around barbecue facilities which are exclusion zones at all times as per council’s Local Law No. 2 Animal Management.

“Providing limited off-leash hours in the entire park follows community feedback, which indicated early mornings and late evenings were the peak times locals enjoyed walking their dogs in Muller Park. 

“Dog walkers will still have 24-hour access to exercise their dog off-leash at Muller Park by using the new 2500 square metre fenced section.

“It’s really important that we meet the increasing demand for dog owners to have a safe and enjoyable place where they can exercise their dogs, and equally that we cater to those community members who would like to visit the park when dogs aren’t running free.”

Muller Park and its surrounds is a culturally significant site for the Kabi Kabi First Nations peoples, who are the Traditional Custodians of the area. Muller Park was an important gathering space for Kabi Kabi peoples.

A fenced area will also be put in place to protect a shell midden mound and associated artefacts at the park. Interpretive signage about Kabi Kabi peoples’ connections to the site and the shell midden is also planned.

Work on the fenced areas will start in late February and wrap up in April, weather and site conditions permitting.
