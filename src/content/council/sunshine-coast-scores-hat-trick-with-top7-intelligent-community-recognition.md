The Sunshine Coast is a 2022 Top7 Intelligent Community, sitting alongside Brazil, Canada, Taiwan and Vietnam.

The status was awarded by New York based Intelligent Community Forum (ICF).

Group CEO ENTAG and Chair of Sunshine Coast Tech Industry Alliance Kris Carver said he was honoured to represent the Sunshine Coast at the ICF Conference in Binh Duong, Vietnam at the award ceremony\*.

“The Sunshine Coast is viewed internationally as a connected and smart community due to its thriving Industry 4.0 growth, in FinTech, AgriTech, CleanTech and advanced manufacturing,” Mr Carver said.

“The growth of these industries is only possible thanks to a connected local ecosystem of extensive digital infrastructure, talent pathways from high school through to TAFE and university, cross-industry support and aligned local government initiatives.

“I would also like to acknowledge and say thank you to everyone who has played crucial roles in seeing the Sunshine Coast named amongst the top seven intelligent communities in the world.”

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was pleased to see the region credited for its commitment and investment in infrastructure, smart city technology and skills development which supports the continued connectivity and innovation within our community.

“We have much to be proud of and Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with local business and industry, continues to be committed to supporting our community to thrive,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We adopted our [Smart City framework and implementation program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Smart-City)
&#x20;in late 2016, rolling out smart city solutions including public lighting, parking, community information and waste management.  

“It continues to be an important priority and our new Maroochydore City Centre is being created with this framework at its core.

“Council also provides free public wi-fi in more than 45 strategic locations to enable greater digital inclusivity and equity.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said delivering the Sunshine Coast [International Broadband Network](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Undersea-Cable)
&#x20;was an Australian local government first and it continued to help our region stand-out and attract business.

“In December 2021 we sold the cable landing station to ASX-listed NEXTDC, in an $8 million deal set to create jobs and stimulate more investment in the region,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The Sunshine Coast has experienced a period of significant growth and diversification so it’s great to see the region recognised for efforts to provide sustainable, healthy, smart and creative solutions.  

“This accolade shows that our region is working towards the [Regional Economic Development Strategy 2013-2033](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033#:~:text=The%20strategy%20provides%20a%2020,local%20residents%20and%20businesses%20alike)
&#x20;priority to position the Sunshine Coast as a recognised, competitive regional identity.”

In October 2022, the ICF will determine which of the Top7 finalists will be named the prestigious Intelligent Community of Year for 2022 based on a second round of analysis, site visits by ICF's co-founders and the votes of an international jury.

The Top7 represent models of economic and social transformation in the 21st Century which demonstrates best practices in broadband deployment and use, workforce development, innovation, digital inclusion and advocacy that offer lessons to regions, cities, towns and villages around the world. 

They are charting new paths to lasting prosperity for their citizens, businesses and institutions. 

In alphabetical order, the Top7 Intelligent Communities are:

*   Binh Duong Smart City, Vietnam
*   Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil
*   Regional Municipality of Durham, Ontario, Canada
*   Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada
*   New Taipei City, Taiwan
*   Prospect, South Australia, Australia
*   Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia
