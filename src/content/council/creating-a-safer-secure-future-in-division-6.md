Creating a safer, secure future and building a strong and thriving community by investing in community facilities is top of the priority list for the Division 6 capital works projects, set to be delivered as part of Sunshine Coast Council’s $816 million 2021/22 Budget.

Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said the projects planned for his division over the next year were focused on key community infrastructure that would make a real difference to locals.

“As a healthy, smart, creative region, we understand our communities are our future and I am committed to providing improvements that make life in Division 6 even better than it already is,” Cr Dickson said.

“Parks are at the heart of our communities, which is why more than $1.1 million has been safely secured to design and construct our very first district park for the Sippy Downs Town Centre.

“Delivering a community centre for our Palmview community is becoming more of a reality with $100,000 allocated to continue to plan for the delivery of this centre.

“Progress will continue on planning for a Sippy Downs library and community centre with $400,000 to assist with the design and delivery phase.

“The knowledge precinct will be made safer for students walking or riding to school and university with $450,000 allocated to construct a connection between Scholars Drive and Columbia Street at Sippy Downs under the federal government’s Local Road and Community Infrastructure Program.

“As always road safety remains important with $70,000 to be used to install a pedestrian refuge and lighting at Karawatha Drive, Mountain Creek.

“We’re also carrying out a variety of small but valuable works at some of our local parks.

“Works such as upgrading barbecues, repairing playground equipment and signage will be welcome additions for Glenfields Neighbourhood Park, Albany Lakes Park, Phoenix Circuit Park, Windmill Park, Riverside Park to name a few.

“With all these projects planned it certainly is an exciting time to be a resident of Division 6.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24, 2021.
