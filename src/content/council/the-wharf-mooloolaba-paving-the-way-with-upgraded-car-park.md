Locals and visitors will soon have a smoother and safer car park to access The Wharf precinct in Mooloolaba, with the car park between River Esplanade and the road in front of Sea Life Mooloolaba about to be resurfaced.

Sunshine Coast Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the rehabilitation works would improve safety and access to the precinct for all road users.   

“The car park is heavily used by beach goers, customers to The Wharf complex, riders and walkers to the marina and surrounding businesses, and the car park asphalt and pavement are showing signs of wear and tear,” Cr Natoli said.

“Council is committed to ensuring the appearance and maintenance of the car park is a priority, which is why upgrade works will start as soon as next month (November).

“Works will be staged to minimise disruption to residents, visitors and local businesses during the summer holiday period.”

Stage one works on the Western parking area (entry from River Esplanade) will begin early-November and stage two works on the Eastern parking area (entry from Parkyn Parade) will start from late January next year.

“The Wharf precinct will remain open throughout the maintenance and council will be doing all it can to complete stage one works by early-December 2021 and will pause for the school holiday period. Works on the Eastern car park will resume late January 2022,” Cr Natoli said.

“Some minor stormwater and drainage works will be undertaken during the day and will result in changed traffic conditions, while the majority of resealing and removal of ageing pavement will be undertaken at night to facilitate the day use of the car park.

“I encourage those visiting The Wharf to allow extra travel time while these works are undertaken.

“This inconvenience will only be temporary, and I ask for your patience while the works are carried out – it’s certainly going to be a big improvement.”

The Wharf Mooloolaba General Manager Karen Hugg said the team was pleased to be working with council to get these works completed as quickly as possible.

“The carpark rehabilitation will significantly improve the quality of the road surface as well as providing visual amenity and creating ease of access for our customers,” Ms Hugg said.

“Whilst there will be short-term disruption to traffic and some temporary car park access limitations, the long-term improvements and enhancements will far outweigh the short-term inconvenience.

“These works will add value and complement this major Mooloolaba precinct area.

“The works are being delivered in two stages to minimise disruption to our customers and The Wharf Mooloolaba appreciates the patience and understanding of retailers, customers, and visitors during the delivery of these works.”
