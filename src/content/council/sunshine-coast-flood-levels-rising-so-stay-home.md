Major flood levels on the Sunshine Coast have either reached record highs or are expected to do so with up to 200 mm of rain expected over the next 24 to 36 hours.

Emergency authorities want the community to understand the danger this weather system poses and are concerned some residents may have become complacent.

They have instructed everyone on the Sunshine Coast to stay home and stay off the roads this weekend.

The slow-moving system, combined with another band coming from the north, may see flood levels exceed historic highest flood events and those levels may stay elevated for some time.

In addition, winds will increase today and into tonight, with gale force winds expected in the hinterland and strong wind gusts on the Coast.

Because the ground is saturated, this heightens the risk of shallow rooted trees being blown over.

Between 100 and 300mm of rain was recorded across the Sunshine Coast region to 7am today (Saturday 26 February).

At 4.8 metres, Palmview broke its 1992 flood level record at 7.30am today (Saturday 26 February). 

Mooloolah River recorded a major flood level overnight and Queensland Fire and Rescue issued an emergency alert urging Creekside and Kawana Forest residents to stay at home and away from flooded waters.

The Sunshine Coast hinterland is on high alert for major flooding.

There is minor to major flooding occurring across areas of the Mooloolah and Maroochy river catchments and all roads into Kenilworth are closed and it remains isolated.

Sunshine Coast Local Disaster Management Group Chair Mayor Mark Jamieson said the overnight rising river levels had caused significant disruptions to the road network. 

“I cannot stress enough that if you’re living in Eumundi, Doonan, Yandina, Nambour, Bli Bli, Coolum Beach, Maroochy North Shore, Bradman Avenue, Creekside, Kawana Forest and Kenilworth please stay home and off the roads as many roads near you are flooded,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We have already seen the severity of what this weather can do, so please, if it’s flooded, forget it.

“Council and emergency services continue to clear debris, assess damage and monitor road closures in flood affected areas.

“Please stay vigilant and tune into warnings and advice from emergency services and authorities, plus the local emergency broadcaster ABC.

“Don’t forget to check on your neighbours and remember pets need to be safe during severe weather events as well.”

SES and QFES crews have responded to almost 200 incidents across our region in the past 24 hours. About 85 per cent of calls were for flooding, the rest for leaking roofs and miscellaneous issues.

Information on weather warnings and road closures is available at Council’s Disaster Hub [disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](http://www.disaster.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)
.

Refer to the Major Riverine Hazard Map on [Disaster Hub](https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/#Map)
&#x20;to be aware of your flood risk. Stay up-to-date with the latest warnings and advice from authorities.

Road closures are listed on [Disaster Hub](https://disasterhub.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
. Residents are urged to stay off the roads, however, evacuate early if it the safest option to manage your flood risk.

**Council services:**

Some council services have been disrupted including waste collection services which were stopped yesterday (Friday 25 February) and remain on hold today (Saturday 26 February) as the road conditions are too unsafe.

If your bin was missed, please leave it on the footpath and the contractor, Remondis, will catch up when weather conditions improve. 

Council understands not everyone can pay their rates online and has extended the rate payment due date to next Friday, March 4.

Other services including waste disposal facilities, libraries, aquatic centres, Caloundra Regional Gallery and Bankfoot House are closed.

While the Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve Rainforest Discover Centre is closed today, the café will still operate.
