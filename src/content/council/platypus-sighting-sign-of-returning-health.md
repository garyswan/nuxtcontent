This photo of a platypus taken during an amphibian survey at the Baroon Pocket Environment Reserve, Montville, was a very special find, telling us that this highly degraded reserve is slowly returning to health.

The area was originally used as a livestock paddock but was provided to council as a developer contribution 25 years ago.

Natural springs feed the creek running through the reserve, which then flows into the Obi Obi Creek. This same creek that flows out of the Kondalilla National Park.

It was heavily infested with lots of weeds such as black berry and lantana, but recently council has begun its long-term strategic assisted revegetation program to give nature the helping hand it needs to recover.

This includes weeding and planting appropriate plants and trees, as well as flora and fauna surveys to monitor the reserve and habitat health and condition.
