More artists are being supported to create work, develop skills and refine their creative projects, through Sunshine Coast Council’s latest Regional Arts Development Fund (RADF) grants.

The successful grant recipients will deliver a diverse range of projects including documentary film making, site-specific performance, and music recordings.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Baberowski said council encouraged artists to apply for the grants by proactively supporting them through the process with both general and specific advice.

“We’ve been running one-on-one consults, led by our RADF officer, for some time,” Cr Baberowski said.

“These have been very successful in helping applicants refine their submissions.

“Now, for the first time, we’ll deliver an intensive application workshop to help artists build the skills to present concise descriptions, articulate the value and relevance of their project, gather support materials and develop clear budgets.”

One-on-one sessions will be held on September 27 and October 4 with the intensive workshop to be held on October 8. Sessions will be held at 2ND Space in Nambour, a new ArtsCoast shared studio space.

Interested applicants can register for sessions on council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Arts-and-Culture/RADF)
, and keep up to date with all opportunities for artists by subscribing to the ArtsCoast newsletter or following ArtsCoast on Instagram.

Cr Baberowski said RADF funding made it easier, and in some cases possible, for the region’s artists, producers and creative practitioners to develop, and create work here on the Sunshine Coast.

“That’s exciting, because the results of those successful projects will further shape, grow and support our region’s already flourishing arts ecology.”

From 24 applications, 11 projects were successful in securing total funding of $47,192 in the latest round of RADF funding.

**See below for the full list of successful applicants.**

Sunshine Coast Council Team Leader Creative Development Megan Rowland said there were some extremely compelling projects in this RADF round of recipients.

“The Sunshine Coat, submitted by Montville local Shaye Hardisty, was successful in receiving funding,” Ms Rowland said.

“This fashion and photography project supports nine Sunshine Coast artists, to collaborate on a collection of coats that pay tribute to Nambour; capturing personal stories from the community and culminating in an exhibition at the Old Ambulance Station during Fashion Revolution week in April 2023.

“Another was from conceptual performing artist Mia Hollingworth who will receive funding to film a unique performance work in the local landscape.

“Other successful applicants include Kenny Waterson, who will produce a 15–20 minute short documentary film; and Mira Chorik for further development of theatre and performance work *Somewhere in the Light: Stories of Love and Loss.”*
