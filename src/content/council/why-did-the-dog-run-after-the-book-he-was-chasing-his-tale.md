As part of Dog Safety Week (June 27-July 1), Sunshine Coast Council will be launching our very own book *When Sammy Met Sunny*.

The book will be used as an educational tool to teach children how to be responsible for their pets.

Sunshine Coast Council Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said the heart-warming story book was a must-read for all families.

“Our community loves animals, with more than 43,500 households owning a dog, a cat or both,” Cr Dickson said.

“We want to work with the community to ensure everyone understands their responsibilities as pet owners, and this new book helps us to reach our youngest members of the community.”

Author and Sunshine Coast Council’s Response Services Education Officer Hannah Maloney said the book was written for all children to learn how to stay safe around dogs.

“The book follows a boy named Sammy, who wants to prove to his parents he is responsible in his desire to own a dog,” Ms Maloney said.

“It’s a book for all families and educators to encourage responsible pet ownership and to create a safe and harmonious coexistence between people, pets and places.

“It’s a story of adventure, emotion and perseverance. Find out if Sammy will get a dog of his own.”

The book was illustrated by council’s in-house graphic designer Kylene Marie and is being printed by a local printer.

As part of Dog Safety Week, and to celebrate the launch of our new book, you can attend a book reading at Sunshine Coast libraries. Look out for Sunny the Dog too!
