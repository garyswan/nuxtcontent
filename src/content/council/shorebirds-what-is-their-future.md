Shorebirds - What is their Future? is an exhibition of paintings by Merrett Keech on the plight of migratory shorebirds.

Merrett believes that the wetland areas of our coastline are nature's bridge between the sea and the land.

A bridge that provides life, sustainability, regeneration and protection of both wildlife and land.\
She also believes that it is up to everyone to maintain, protect and aid our coastal wetlands and estuaries for future generations to come.

Merrett's artworks look specifically at the Far Eastern Curlew and the impact of development affecting wetlands all around Australia.

You’ll also have the chance to learn more about migratory shorebirds that holiday on the Sunshine Coast each year over the summer months.

Drop in style, family friendly activities will be available on site including a shorebird game designed by students from Maroochydore State School.

Join us for the opening event on Saturday 14 January at 10am which includes a shorebird presentation, an artist talk by Merrett Keech and children’s activities.
