An upgrade to the Warriors Football Club at Palmwoods, beautifying Woombye, maintaining the green heart at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve and upgrades to Maroochy Botanic Gardens are some of the Sunshine Coast Council 2022–23 Budget highlights for Division 5. Council’s $847 million budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, sustainable Sunshine Coast.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said there was a range of exciting projects for our community to look forward to in this budget.\
“This includes kicking goals for the Palmwoods Warriors Football club which will receive a $600,000 upgrade,” Cr Johnston said.\
“One of my top priorities is to keep our small communities, residents and farmers connected on our country roads.\
“That’s why this budget will deliver upgrades, reseals, lane widening, rehabilitations and bridge improvements to several roads including Brandenburg Road in Mooloolah Valley, Stage 5 works for Glenview Road in Glenview, portions of Perrins Road and Mossy Bank Roads in Eudlo and various roads in Maleny, Chevallum, Wootha and Woombye.

“Focusing on upgrading our road network will improve access and safety for our daily commutes and all road users including pedestrians and cyclists.\
“There will also be a number of other upgrades taking place in the hinterland including track renewals at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve which covers 55 hectares of tranquil rainforest with diverse flora and wildlife.\
“The Ecological Park Master Plan will move forward and the Butterfly Walk will also undergo some renewal work and installation of interpretive signage to help visitors discover new and dramatic scenery.\
“Funding has also been allocated for future planning of Maroochy Botanic Garden Masterplan’s ‘Eucalypt Glades’ which aims to build on visitor experience.\
“Council’s 2022–23 budget allocation will see funding to complete Woombye’s new-look streetscape, which is progressing quite nicely since preliminary works on the additional car parking on Hill, Blackall and Keli streets wrapped up early-March.\
“More than $970,000 has been allocated to complete the second phase of works, which will start mid-year, to create a cool and shady main street, improve pedestrian accessibility and calm traffic.”\
Cr Johnston said higher in the hinterland, design funding would be invested to start consultation and planning for some minor streetscape upgrades in Montville and Maleny to improve the day-to-day experience of people living, working and visiting the popular hinterland towns.\
“Placemaking projects are an important part of enhancing those aspects our residents already love about their lively townships,” he said.\
“Many lookouts, parks and playgrounds across Division 5 will also be upgraded with assets being replaced or installed, including signage, barbecues, shelters, playgrounds and shade sails.\
“This budget will deliver a wide variety of works across our division which I’m sure we will all look forward to as we continue towards our vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative.”\
Council handed down its $847 million budget on June 23.
