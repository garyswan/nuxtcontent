From boutiques, restaurants and creamy gelato to recreation businesses and the bustling marina there’s no doubt The Wharf Mooloolaba is a key Sunshine Coast destination.

The car park is heavily used by locals, beach goers, customers, holiday makers, walkers and riders daily, and the car park asphalt and pavement has shown signs of wear and tear.

But if you’ve visited The Wharf recently you might have noticed the western section of the car park between the River Esplanade and rear of Sea Life has benefited from a new smooth and safer upgrade.

The works for stage 1 were undertaken in November 2021 and wrapped up prior to Christmas.

Now stage 2 resurfacing works are about to start on the eastern side – the larger section of car park adjacent to Sea Life and The Savvy Squire.

**Here’s what you need to know!**

The work will include kerb and channel replacement, asphalt rehabilitation, line marking, stormwater gully replacement and landscaping improvements.

Since the eastern side of the car park is the largest section to complete asphalting, five shifts of night works (6pm-6am) are scheduled to occur from Monday 14 to Friday 18 February 2022.

It will be business as usual for The Wharf Mooloolaba precinct, however delays may occur while machinery is in operation and car park access may be temporarily affected.

Those visiting The Wharf are encouraged to allow extra travel time while these works are undertaken.

This inconvenience will only be temporary, and Sunshine Coast Council thanks businesses and residents for your patience while the works are carried out.

The works are anticipated to be completed by March, weather and site conditions permitting.

Traffic control and signage will help ensure the safety of pedestrians, motorists and construction workers.

Alternative parking can be found throughout Mooloolaba including the new ParknGo Mooloolaba Central car park [www.parkngo.com.au](http://www.parkngo.com.au)
