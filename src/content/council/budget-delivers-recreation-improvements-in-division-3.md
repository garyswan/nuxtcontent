A $5 million investment to progress the 75 hectare Honeyfarm Road Sport and Recreation Precinct, $550,000 to implement the Kawana Regional Aquatic Centre master plan and more than $210,000 to improve our parks and gardens are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 3.

Councillor Peter Cox said the Division 3 budget allocations included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a positive and active future for residents across the division.

“A $5 million injection towards the Honeyfarm Road Sport and Recreation Precinct at Meridan Plains is a significant project for Division 3 and the wider Sunshine Coast region,” Cr Cox said.

“This investment will go towards providing a highly functional regional sports facility which will ultimately include a unique district recreation park for all ages and abilities.

“Council will also spend $550,000 to implement the Kawana Regional Aquatic Centre master plan which will help position the centre as a regional facility to cater for everyone, from Olympic-level coaches and athletes right through to schools, fitness classes, scuba divers and water polo players. 

“It also caters for vision-impaired swimmers and those with special needs who just love the feel of the water and being weightless.

“In addition, there will be more than $210,000 spent during the 2021/22 financial year to improve parks throughout Division 3.

“These upgrades vary from simple seating and barbecue refurbishments to larger playground upgrades and replacements.

“I’m also very pleased to announce we’re contributing another $220,000 to the coastal pathway project to extend the Bokarina-Warana section through to John Hotton Park, Bokarina.

“The Coastal Pathway is the Sunshine Coast’s most popular shared pathway extending 73 kilometres from Bells Creek at Golden Beach in the south, to Coolum in the north so I’m pleased to see this section added to the network.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
