A $2.32 million road upgrade for Citrus Road, Palmwoods, beautifying Eudlo’s and Woombye’s main streets and improving infrastructure are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 5.

Divisional councillor Winston Johnston said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future across the region.

“Keeping our small communities, residents and businesses connected is a top priority, but more importantly is making sure everyone continues to enjoy our unique urban and rural lifestyle,” Cr Johnston said.

“That’s why this budget will deliver upgrades, reseals, lane widening, rehabilitations and bridge improvements to a number of roads including the upgrade of Citrus Road at Palmwoods, Daltons Bridge along Eastern Mary River Road, Cambroon.

“Council will also complete designs of Obi Lane and Obi Lane South car park at Maleny, Christensens Road at Hunchy, and for a number of future gravel road upgrades.

“There will also be road upgrades at Mooloolah, Woombye, Glenview, Landers Shoot and Reesville which will improve access and safety for our daily commuters and all road users.

“Speaking of how we get around town, council will also invest more than $3 million to improve community connectivity within Division 5 including trail resurfacing at Gardeners Falls and entrance improvements into Lagoon Walk, Maroochy Bushland Botanic Gardens, Tanawah.

“Council will also finalise the design for a pedestrian bridge over Obi Obi Creek which will connect the Maleny Community Precinct pathway to Gardners Falls.

“Council’s 2021/22 budget allocation will see $200,000 towards constructing Eudlo’s new look main street, which aims to improve the day-to-day experience of people living, working, and visiting the hinterland town.

“The allocation of $450,000 will progress Stage 1 design and construction to beautify Blackall Street, Woombye. Placemaking projects are an important part of enhancing what the community already loves about their local townships.

“Many parks and playgrounds across Division 5 will also be upgraded with assets being replaced including barbecues, shelters, playgrounds and shade sail installations.

“I’m pleased to deliver a wide variety of funding across Division 5 which I think the community will warmly welcome. It’s a step in the right direction and being a healthy, smart and creative region.”

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
