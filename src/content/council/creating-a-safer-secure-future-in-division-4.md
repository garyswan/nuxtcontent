A $2.5 million road upgrade at Maroochydore, continuation of the Maroochy Groyne project, a $5.25 million investment to upgrade the Mooloolaba Foreshore northern parkland and significant upgrades to parks are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2021/22 Budget highlights for Division 4.

Divisional Councillor Joe Natoli said council’s $816 million budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a safer, secure future.

“Improving safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, improving facilities and enhancing the lifestyle of residents and businesses remain a strong focus for my division,” Cr Natoli said.

“This includes a $24.6 million investment in Stage 2 and 3 of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade on Brisbane Road, inclusive of the $12 million Australian Government funding through the $4 billion Urban Congestion Fund.

“Brisbane Road at Mooloolaba currently carries around 20,000 vehicles per day and this is expected to increase to about 30,000 vehicles per day by 2041.

“Meanwhile, Maroochy Boulevard, Maroochydore, currently carries around 35,000 vehicles per day and this is expected to increase to above 40,000 vehicles per day by 2041.

“To ensure everyone commutes safely on this road, over the coming months council will upgrade the Maroochy Boulevard and Dalton Drive intersection thanks to a $2.5 million investment.

“Funds will be invested in Division 4 parks and playgrounds to help the Sunshine Coast community achieve a healthy, active and sustainable lifestyle.

“Exercise equipment and new playground features will be installed at Mooloolaba, Maroochydore, Buddina and Warana.

“Even fishermen will benefit from this year’s budget with the renewal of the fish table at the Mooloolaba Spit.

“Funding has been allocated to develop a masterplan for the areas encompassing Point Cartwright, La Balsa Park and through to Kawana Surf Club.

“The masterplan will help create a vision for the area and guide future management of the site.

“Council will also invest more than $187,000 in new and upgraded stormwater quality infrastructure across Division 4.

“I am also very pleased to announce that $1.1 million will go towards the continuation of the Maroochy Goyne project.

“The next and final stage of the project is scheduled to start in this financial year and will focus on the two southern-most groyne structures and linking wall.”

Another $220,000 will be invested in the coastal pathway to extend the Bokarina-Warana section through to John Hotton Park, Bokarina.

The Coastal Pathway is the Sunshine Coast’s most popular shared pathway extending 73 kilometres from Bells Creek at Golden Beach in the south, to Coolum in the north.

Council handed down its $816 million budget on June 24.
