UPDATE (Friday March 4, 2022): This has been extended until close of business Sunday March 13.

Sunshine Coast Council is putting on extra staff to deal with the anticipated extra customers and if there are any delays, we appreciate your patience and kindness.

Please note we cannot accept large volumes of green waste at this time, as those sites are full. We will keep you updated and let you know when we can receive green waste.

EARLIER: From today (Thursday March 3, 2022) until close of business Sunday (March 6, 2022) Sunshine Coast Council is offering free general and food waste disposal to residents impacted by flooding.

However residents are cautioned to only be on the roads when safe to do so.

Residents with storm-related garden waste are asked to keep it on their properties until further notice, given a lack of short term storage at resource recovery centres.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council aimed to support residents as they cleaned up after the severe weather.

“The recent disaster event made our Sunshine Coast resource recovery centres and transfer stations inaccessible,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Now they are in a state to receive general waste, flood damaged items can be dropped off for free.

“In the first instance, residents are reminded to contact their insurer, who may have specific requirements in the event of a claim.

“Council is working with Volunteering Sunshine Coast to coordinate support for those needing assistance with the removal of flood damaged goods and green waste.”

If you need assistance email Customer.Service\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or text 0456 316 306 (note this number is text only, no calls).

Please provide your name, contact number and address and you will be contacted about your request.

Anyone interested in volunteering can register their interest at [www.volunteeringsunshinecoast.org.au](http://www.volunteeringsunshinecoast.org.au)
&#x20;and click on ‘Become a Volunteer’ to complete an application form.

Mayor Jamieson said unfortunately, council’s garden waste storage areas were full and unable to receive large volumes of green waste at this time.

“In the short-term, we ask residents to store garden waste on their property – not on their footpath – until council can decrease the current stocks at our transfer stations,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We will let residents know when we can accept large quantities of garden waste again and thank you for patience.”

Mayor Jamieson also thanked the volunteers for the vital assistance offered to the Sunshine Coast community.

“Our SES volunteers have been doing a tremendous job being front and centre of the most recent disaster event and the storms overnight and this morning,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We cannot thank them enough and ask our community to be patient as they deal with the many requests coming through.

“Our council crews and contractors have been out on site this week and again this morning to inspect and assess damage to council roads and public infrastructure.

“Sunshine Coast roads, pathways, tracks, trails, parks, gardens, waterways and beaches have had an incredible amount of water move through them.

“We are prioritising high use areas and connecting roads and we ask our community to be patient with us and kind to our teams as we repair and clear our roads and infrastructure across the region over the weeks ahead.”
