The word on the street is that fun, colourful and leafy is heading to the community space at the corner of Currie and Bury streets at Nambour starting with a bright new mural this week (Wednesday 28 April).

Sunshine Coast Council is giving the forecourt in front of council’s Eddie De Vere building a revamp to entice activity and life to the important public space.

Division 10 and Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the revamp would provide shade and seating for locals and visitors who accessed the Nambour Library and council’s customer service centre.

“We want to create a space that provides opportunities for people to relax, have fun and socialise,” Cr Law said.

“Over the next two months, council will transform the forecourt by introducing more shade, art and infrastructure to create a more user-friendly space.”

The community will start to see a mural come to life from today (Wednesday 28 April).

"Integrated seating, a games area and festoon lighting over green nooks will help deliver council’s vision of a hub with a sub-tropical experience for the local community to enjoy and will be a valuable investment to the economy in the area."

Inspired by a ‘Golden Ratio Rainforest’ it will guide your eye from the Nambour Library around to the council building.

“The mural will be created by the very talented Sunshine Coast artist Alison Mooney who will be connecting the space to nature with abstract compositions of native flora including the town namesake, the Namba Tree, also known as the bottle brush (Callistemon Viminal),” Cr Law said.

“You’ll also see species like the Banana Bush pods, Joyweed blossoms and leaves from the Hairy Milk Vine which will contribute to the layers of the mural and rainforest feel.

“Make sure you keep your eyes peeled over the coming weeks as the mural takes on a life of its own.

“Shaded dining areas will be installed and a central open lawn area will soften and help cool the area.

“Additional shade for the existing slide is also being investigated so that a long-term solution will be in place before the warmer weather returns.

“Integrated seating, a games area and festoon lighting over green nooks will help deliver council’s vision of a hub with a sub-tropical experience for the local community to enjoy and will be a valuable investment to the economy in the area.”

The refurbishment of the space is scheduled to be completed mid-2021, weather and site conditions permitting. Council facilities will remain operational with minimal changes to access arrangements.
