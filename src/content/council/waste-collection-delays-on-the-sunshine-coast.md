Sunshine Coast Council recognises some people are experiencing delays in their waste being collected by our waste collection contractor Remondis.

Like many industries across the Sunshine Coast and the country, unfortunately Remondis is feeling the impacts of COVID-19 due to staff needing to isolate to help keep their employees and our community safe.

We thank our community for your patience. Please be kind to the drivers and our Council Customer Contact staff who are working hard to get the job done in these challenging times.

Remondis is looking at its scheduling, including trying to catch up on weekends or after normal working hours.

The company is also working through the backlog of new and replacement bin orders as quickly as possible.
