If you’re chasing family friendly fun in the sun, look no further than the Coastal Pathway.

The 73 km spectacular Coastal Pathway runs from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

Walk, jog, cycle, skate or scoot along the pathway while taking in the sights and sounds of the beautiful coastline.

Check out the Coastal Pathway guide or watch the videos of what the pathway has to offer by visiting council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
.
