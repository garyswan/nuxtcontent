A coastal path that starts in the bushland at the end of Dicky Beach and takes you through a shaded pathway to the eastern end of Currimundi Lake - 3.4km return.

### Suitability

Suitable for walkers, runners, recreational cyclists, wheelchairs and prams - and is an easy grade.

### Highlights

This is an easy 1.7 km one-way walk or cycle that is suitable for the whole family.

Walkers have the option to walk along the path through beautiful coastal bushland, with pockets of views onto the local beaches.

Otherwise (when warm enough), head down onto the beach and enjoy a swim along the way!

The path option will take you across the picturesque Coondibah Creek bridge - half-way through the walk - with expansive views over the creek (beautiful any time of day).

Once you reach Currimundi Lake you won’t want to leave in a hurry. The calm waters and endless sand make it an aquatic playground for the whole family.

This largely shaded section of the coastal pathway is a great option for hotter days.

### Take care

Bikes on pathway can come through quite quickly so dogs must be on leash for everyone's safety. Give dogs free time at Coondibah Creek.

### Afterwards

Be sure spend some time enjoying the stunning surrounds in Cliff Hargreaves Park. This popular park overlooks Currimundi Lake and has a playground, barbecue and picnic tables, natural shade, beach showers as well as public amenities. Alternatively, you can purchase food and drinks from the beach front cafes.

Feeling energetic? Continue north along the coastal pathway to Warana!

### How to get there

Park your car at Dicky Beach and then head towards the surf club and you’ll see the pathway continue past the club.
