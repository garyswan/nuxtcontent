The Sunshine Coast has confronted many challenges in 2021 but as the year comes to a close, it’s time to recognise our collective achievements.

As with previous years, Mayor Mark Jamieson will provide his State of our Region update on December 8.

The online premiere will feature community champions that have helped connect our community throughout the year.

State of our Region will also showcase council’s strong commitment to creating a safer, secure future for our community and supporting the region’s recovery from the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 

Mayor Jamieson said the past 12 months had been among the most extraordinary he had seen in nearly ten years in local government.

“Emotionally, financially and socially our community had been tested with the cancellation of much-loved events, closures of public facilities, supply chain challenges and the emotional burden of uncertainty,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Despite all of these challenges, our region has a lot to be proud of and to look forward to.

“Our annual State of our Region is an opportunity for our community to come together and reflect on the year that is past.”

State of our Region will be streamed on Council’s Facebook page on December 8, 9am and available to watch anytime from council’s website at [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stateofourregion](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stateofourregion)
.

The recording will also be available to watch at council libraries. 

“From the outset of this pandemic, our council has had a single and unwavering priority to safeguard the interests and wellbeing of our community in everything we do - and in ways not hitherto thought possible,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The health response has involved all tiers of government.

“But much of what needed to occur on the ground to keep our community safe fell to our council – indeed all councils – to implement.

“Through our collective efforts, our council has continued to service the needs of our community and supported local business and industry to keep money circulating in the region and keep people employed – all the while, helping each other to adjust to the new ‘COVID normal’.

Mayor Jamieson said the number of people who had shone brightly through the course of the year, despite the challenges, are worthy of recognition.
