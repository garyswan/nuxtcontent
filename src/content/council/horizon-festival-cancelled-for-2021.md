In the interest of community safety and in light of the recent lockdown, and the restrictions in place, Sunshine Coast Council’s Horizon Festival 2021 has been cancelled.

The festival was scheduled to be held across the region from 27 August to 5 September 2021.

Anyone who purchased tickets to cancelled Horizon Festival events will be contacted in the coming days to arrange a full refund.

Sunshine Coast Council thanks Horizon Festival audiences, artists, supporters, and suppliers for their patience and support as it works through the next steps, including identifying any opportunities to present some aspects of the 2021 program.

Horizon Festival, Acting Director Zoe Graham said the decision to cancel the Festival came after close consultation with health authorities, discussions with artists and with the safety of our community top of in mind.

“The impact of the recent lockdown, the current restrictions and the uncertainty of what may unfold over the coming weeks has made festival delivery extremely challenging,” Ms Graham said.

“Featuring hundreds of artists, Horizon Festival 2021 was shaping up to be an incredible 10 days and we are devastated not to be able to present these events, artworks and experiences for our community to enjoy.”

“Council understand this is a trying time for those in the arts sector. Festival organisers have been, and will continue to, liaise with artists and presenters to determine future presentation opportunities for programs that, three weeks out of the Festival start date, were very close to ‘show ready’.

“We will be providing up to date information via our website [horizonfestival.com.au](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/)
&#x20;or sign up to our Facebook, Instagram or e-news.”
