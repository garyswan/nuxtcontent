Sunshine Coast Council Libraries have collaborated with local author and illustrator Philip Bunting to create an all-new kids-only library card.

The new library card design features a wonderful creature created by Philip, called the *Pythonidae Bookmunchii Sunnycoastius*, or more commonly known as the Common Bookeater Python.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said Sunshine Coast Libraries kids-only library cards have featured characters from well-known children’s books since 2008.

“Our children’s early literacy is so important and these library cards aim to encourage a child’s interest in the library from a young age, as well as a bit of imagination,” Cr Law said. 

“The cards are created with the firm belief that every child needs a Library card.

“It is probably the first official document a child will own and it gives them access to thousands of physical and digital resources to explore, learn, dream and imagine.”

Local author and illustrator Philip Bunting firmly believes that reading with children from a young age not only strengthens their emergent literacy skills, but also builds positive associations with reading and learning that the child will carry into later life.

“Our Sunshine Coast Libraries punch well above their weight – we are very lucky to have such great facilities here on our doorstep – and I am stoked to have created this card for them. I hope that my silly illo will help to encourage a few more Sunny Coast kids to join the library, and check out the amazing resources our libraries provide (for free!),” Mr Bunting said.

“I should warn you, however, that the Common Bookeater Python (Pythonidae Bookmunchii Sunnycoastius) is a particularly persistent predator, and they get especially hungry at this time of the year… so keep your books close.”

The new library cards will be available from Tuesday 6 April so remember to stop into your local library these school holidays to sign-up – library membership is free!

Philip’s books have been translated into multiple languages and published in more than 30 countries around the world. Since his first book was published in 2017, Philip has received many praises, including Honours from the Children’s Book Council of Australia. He was also nominated for the Kate Greenaway Medal in 2018.

One of Philip’s recent titles – *Give Me Some Space!* – has been selected as the Australian Library and Information Association’s [National Simultaneous Storytime](https://www.alia.org.au/nss)
&#x20;book for 2021. In keeping with the theme, a copy of the book has already journeyed to space and is currently housed in the International Space Station where it will be read by an astronaut and beamed to more than 1 million children across Australia, on Wednesday 19 May at 11am. .
