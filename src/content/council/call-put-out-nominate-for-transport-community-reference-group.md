Do you have an interest in seeing Sunshine Coast reaching its sustainable transport potential? Do you want to have input into future parking solutions, how we can decrease our dependence on cars and increase walking and cycling opportunities?

If so, Sunshine Coast Council wants to hear from you and is seeking nominations from organisations and individuals to join the Transport Community Reference Group (TCRG).

This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to represent our community and engage, advocate, consult and contribute to this important policy-shaping forum.

Members of this community reference group will discuss, review and shape ideas from our community and council and play a valuable role in implementing council’s Integrated Transport Strategy.

Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said council’s transport strategy is designed to optimise council’s response to the Sunshine Coast’s travel challenges and opportunities.

“Since its establishment in 2009, the community reference group has provided valuable input and advice on matters such as travel behaviour change, parking and active transport,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The group ensures council receives direct community feedback on proposed policy and initiatives in a bid to achieve the best sustainable transport system possible to enhance the lifestyle of Sunshine Coast residents.

“We are encouraging people from a wide variety of interests and professions to nominate for our TCRG. We need all ages and abilities and diversity of interests to represent our community.”

TCRG members meet quarterly to discuss and provide invaluable insight, feedback and ideas on all transport-related topics.

It consists of up to 15 members comprising a mix of people representing our residents, businesses, community organisations and industry.

Community members will be appointed for a 12-month period with membership reviewed annually.

Nominations close 5pm on Friday 20 August 2021.
