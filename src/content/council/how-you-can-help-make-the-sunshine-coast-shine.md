If you love where you live and want to make it even better, then this challenge is for you.\
Sunshine Coast residents are invited to be part of the 33rd annual Clean Up Australia Day on Sunday, March 5.

This year several groups will be running clean-ups, including Night Eyes Water and Landcare, Rotary Club of Caloundra Pacific, 2nd Nambour Scout Group, Twin Waters Residents Association and many more.

Everyone is welcome to join in and the day presents a great opportunity to get to know more people from your community and make a real difference.

To register, simply visit the Clean Up Australia Day website at: [www.cleanup.org.au/cleanupaustraliaday](http://www.cleanup.org.au/cleanupaustraliaday)
, select ‘join a clean-up’ and search for an event nearby by entering your postcode or suburb.

Registration is free and covers participants under Clean Up Australia Day’s public liability insurance.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez, who will join in at Coolum, said Clean Up Australia Day was a reminder to respect our environment and love where we live.

“A lot of us choose to live on the Sunshine Coast because of its stunning natural environment – keeping it clean helps it stay that way,” Cr Suarez said.

“Council proudly supports the event through the Waste 2 Resource Education Program, assisting groups to organise their events, and arranging for the litter to be collected.

“And we are grateful to the many amazing groups and individuals who participate in and lead our region’s clean-up activities, both on Clean Up Australia Day and throughout the year.

“They do an amazing job every year, helping council to achieve its vision of a sustainable region, and I thank all the volunteers for being so generous with their time.”

Cr Suarez said the important event was also a reminder that every day was a clean-up day.\
“Picking up even just one piece of litter can make a real difference,” Cr Suarez said.

“A clean, sustainable Sunshine Coast is in our hands."
