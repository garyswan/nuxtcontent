Calling all Maleny community groups, businesses and residents – it’s time to save the date and share your input into shaping Maleny Placemaking and Streetscape Project.

Council has been working with the Maleny community for many years to develop a shared design everyone can be proud of.

The community are invited to attend an information session where Council would like residents, businesses and visitors to unpack the design and share your valuable feedback with the project team.

This is a great opportunity to see whether priorities and design improvements have captured the community’s needs, the character and charm of Maleny.

## Save the date

**Date and Time**: 5-8pm, 20 July 2023

**Location**: Maleny Community Centre, 23 Maple St, Maleny QLD 4552

&#x20;to register your interest in attending the workshop, alternatively email placemaking\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

## Previous engagement

Thank you for sharing your feedback on the key areas and elements important for Maple Street improvement during the ‘Review and Refresh’ community consultation between 18 July and 15 August 2022.

Following this consultation, three key themes have been identified as community priorities; FUNCTION, COMFORT and SAFETY.

The community will be invited to provide further feedback on the priorities, vision and themes on the draft design between 20 July and 20 August 2023 – watch this space on how you can provide feedback!
