You are invited to experience a fire ceremony, traditional dance and special presentation from a respected elder with a lifelong passion for art.

The event, to be held in the Sunshine Coast hinterland on Wednesday, May 24, will be free and provide an exciting and uplifting launch to 2023 National Reconciliation Week.

This year’s theme is ***Be a Voice for Generations*** and it encourages all Australians to be a voice for reconciliation in tangible ways in our everyday lives – where we live, work and socialise.

The local launch event will be hosted on Jinibara Country and feature First Nation performances and presentations.

Entertainment will include traditional performances from Jinibara Dance, Deerum Wandem (Sunrise Dancers) and Wagga Torres Strait Islander Dance Company, as well as a fire ceremony and a presentation from Jinibara Elder, Uncle Noel Blair.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said National Reconciliation Week, which would run from May 27 to June 3, was a time to learn and explore how we can contribute to achieving reconciliation in Australia.

“Sunshine Coast Council was the first local government in Queensland to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan in partnership with Reconciliation Australia,’’ Cr Law said.

“We have placed a high priority on building stronger relationships with First Nations peoples, valuing their cultures and heritage and their contribution to the social fabric of our community.

“I encourage you to come along to the launch event and help us celebrate and take the opportunity to learn more about First Nations’ histories, cultures and achievements.”
