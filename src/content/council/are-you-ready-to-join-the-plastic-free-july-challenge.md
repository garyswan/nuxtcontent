It can be as easy as picking one single-use plastic item to avoid or swap for a reusable alternative. 

Many people choose to avoid the Top 4 single-use plastics:

*   Take-away coffee cups
*   Plastic shopping bags
*   Plastic straws
*   Water bottles. 

Some ‘go for gold’ and try to eliminate all single-use plastics for a month.

It's popular to form or join a group to take the challenge together.

This could be the start of a life-changing experience for you, your family, your colleagues, or your local school.
