Locals and visitors to Mooloolaba and Maroochydore can now get around on e-scooters and e-bikes, during Sunshine Coast Council’s trial period. 

The operation of the eco-friendly trial was launched today (Wednesday, June 7), by Sunshine Coast Council’s CEO Emma Thomas, at Mooloolaba’s Northern Parklands, along with Council’s e-transport partner Neuron Mobility.

Neuron Mobility now has 50% of its Sunshine Coast e-scooter and e-bike fleet operational.

A total of 400 e-scooters and 75 e-bikes will be available by June 30. The micro mobility options will be available to hire from a number of designated parking stations located throughout Mooloolaba and Maroochydore.

Neuron Mobility Regional Manager Tim Morris said the safe operation of e-scooters and e-bikes was a top priority.

“We are delighted to be launching our e-scooters and e-bikes on the Sunshine Coast and look forward to partnering with Council to deliver a safe and convenient service to help people move around Maroochydore and Mooloolaba,” Mr Morris said.

“We have worked closely with the council to set up a number of designated parking stations across the riding zone. Riders will only be able to end their trip in these stations.

“There are also a number of slow-zones and no-ride zones, so we encourage riders to check the app before they start their trip and plan their journey accordingly.”

Neuron Mobility is one of Australia’s leading e-mobility share program providers with significant experience nationally and in Queensland, operating in Brisbane, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Townsville, and Yeppoon.

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas was one of the first locals to try out one of the e-scooters.

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas takes a Neuron Mobility e-scooter for a spin.

The CEO said the introduction of the smooth and safe e-scooters provided another simple way of moving around and was a viable choice for short journeys.

“This 18-month trial gives Council the opportunity to assess if e-transport is a good fit for our region and if the community will embrace this mode of transport as an alternative for getting around the Mooloolaba and Maroochydore hubs,” Ms Thomas said.

“E-scooters are environmentally friendly with zero emissions, in line with Council’s [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/about-the-strategy)
&#x20;that aims to foster healthy, smart and creative solutions to how we live and move around the region.

“It’s a healthy, safe alternative for adults to enjoy all the Coast has to offer.

“A happy, healthy community is a Council priority, and this new e-transport trial fits with our Sunshine Coast lifestyle.

Neuron Mobility will now undertake community education and awareness campaigns that educate riders on riding rules, and will hold ScootSafe events on Thursday, June 8, from 11am – 4pm in Mooloolaba (between the surf club and look with a view) and on Saturday, June 10, from 11am – 4pm at Cotton Tree Park (between First Jetty and Cotton Tree Aquatic Centre).

Riders who visit the ScootSafe events will have the opportunity to take a short safety briefing and will be able to earn free credits for future rides.

Users will also be directed to the company’s online education platform, ScootSafe Academy, where they can complete gamified modules teaching them how to ride an e-scooter and e-bike safely. 

The operator is committed to ensuring all users of Neuron electric bikes and scooters adhere to the road rules and comply with all other Department of Transport and Main Roads requirements.
