Sunshine Coast Council has recognised the Earth is in a state of climate emergency.

The resolution, adopted unanimously at the November Ordinary Meeting, signals a continuation of decisive action by council to reduce greenhouse gas emissions urgently, accelerating the great work which is already being done in the region.

Council also resolved to prepare an interim report on the progress of the Zero-net Emissions Plan and Regional Climate Action Roadmap and to investigate a governance structure and framework necessary to support a whole-of-council response to the climate emergency to achieve our strategic target of becoming a zero-net emissions organisation by 2041.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council had consistently taken a proactive approach to developing and implementing strong climate change policy that was evidence-based and aligned with the best available science and would continue to do so as the region played its role in responding to the climate emergency.

“We continue to see an evidence-based approach as an effective strategy to deliver meaningful on-ground outcomes to address the potential impacts of climate change,” Mayor Jamieson said. 

“Council recognises the complexity of a changing climate and is implementing a range of proactive steps to limit the potential impacts of climate change while encouraging adaptation and resilience across the region.”

Division 10 Councillor David Law, who introduced the matter for debate at the November Ordinary Meeting, said the unanimous vote clearly demonstrated council’s recognition that we are in a state of climate emergency, requiring urgent and sustained effort to reach net zero emissions by 2041.

“This new decisive action will strengthen council’s comprehensive Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS) and our approach to responding to the impacts of climate change,” Cr Law said.

“The ELS provides long-term strategic thinking and promotes immediate action for a number of challenges, including building resilience to the projected adverse impacts of climate change and taking steps to adapt to and mitigate its expected effects, while enabling new and emerging technologies to be implemented and benefits realised.

“Council also acknowledged the significant actions already being taken through the implementation of the ELS, towards the mitigation of climate impacts and reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 

“Council looks forward to ongoing partnerships with our community to collectively respond to both the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change as we deliver a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast into the future.”
