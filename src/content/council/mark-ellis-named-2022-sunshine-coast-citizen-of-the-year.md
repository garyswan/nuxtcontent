Nine Sunshine Coast residents were recognised for their outstanding contributions to the Sunshine Coast region at a special ceremony today (March 22) to announce this year’s Sunshine Coast Australia Day Award recipients.

Buderim’s Mark Ellis was named Citizen of the year for his tireless work advocating to improve the lives of those less fortunate in the community and for collective action to put a stop to homelessness.

Through his role as Community Development Coordinator at the Maroochy Neighbourhood Centre, Mark co-ordinated the One Roof Program, which provides everything from hot showers and haircuts to mental health and medical support , for people who are homeless.

In one year, the One Roof Program has provided free meals for more than 23,000 vulnerable people and services for more than 9,000 people.

He helped launch Sunny Street’s very first medical outreach clinic, which seeks to provide free medical assistance to the vulnerable.

Mark has also helped raise $200,000 for the coast’s first sleep bus for men, women and children.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson, on behalf of Sunshine Coast Council and the Sunshine Coast community, congratulated each Sunshine Coast Australia Day Award nominee at the ceremony.

“There are so many outstanding stories of community spirit, inspiration and comradery, which gives us all hope for 2022 and beyond,” Mayor Jamieson said

“As a nominee in these awards, you represent so much of what is great about the Sunshine Coast and why it is such an enjoyable and desirable place to live.

“Your efforts help build community vitality and resilience and are an integral part of the social fabric of our region.

“Each one of our nominees has made a difference to our Sunshine Coast in the past 12 months, and I’m sure will continue to do so into the future.”
