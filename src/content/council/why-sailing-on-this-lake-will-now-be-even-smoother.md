A new addition to a popular sailing spot will make it easier for the sport’s smallest vessels to navigate to the water.

In collaboration with the community, Sunshine Coast Council has installed an aluminium platform from which model boat enthusiasts can launch their boats into Lake Kawana or use for other recreational activities such as paddling on the lake.

Sunshine Coast Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said he hoped the platform would continue to make Lake Kawana a well-loved community space.

“Council has worked with the club and installed a multi-use aluminium platform at the southern end of sportsman parade in Kawana,” Cr Cox said.

“The platform will assist the model sailing club to access the lake when water levels are low.

“The model sailing boats on Lake Kawana are an iconic sight for onlookers and I hope the platform will be a welcomed addition to the lake.”

The Sunshine Coast Radio Sailing Club (SCRSC) member Richard Brady said the club had almost 50 active members who sail on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

“Races are held over a defined course which is set according to the wind condition on the day. We sail both scratch and handicap start races so all sailors have a chance of success. Usually, a sailing day will consist of 8 to 10 individual races,” Mr Brady said.

“Launching the yacht can be difficult as the sailor has to ensure that the yacht‘s keel clears the rocks at the bottom of the lake.  This requires the sailor to reach out over the water with a yacht weighing 4 kilograms creating the possibility of a fall into the lake.

“As the lake’s water level can change the process of launching can be quite difficult at times when the level is especially low.

“Most of our sailors are at, or near, retirement age and some have mobility issues. Which increases the fall hazard. The new launch platform will significantly reduce this hazard.”
