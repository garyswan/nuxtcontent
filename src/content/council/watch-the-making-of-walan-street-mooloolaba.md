Ever wondered what goes into building a road? Take a look at the works completed as part of Stage 1 of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade (MTCU).

The video shows Walan Street being widened to four traffic lanes which has improved traffic flow between Venning Street and Smith Street, Mooloolaba.

*Watch the progression of Walan Street four laning upgrade to improve traffic flow.*

The upgrade wrapped up in April 2021 and included the four laning of Walan Street, a new signalised intersection at Walan Street and Naroo Court, a formalised pedestrian crossing across Walan Street and Naroo Court with pram and disability compliant access ramps as well as landscaping and green spaces.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade project is being constructed in four stages over a period of four years (2019 – 2023).

In addition to improving traffic flow, this important project will enhance the southern entrance into Mooloolaba and create a corridor that is integrated and inviting for pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and public transport users.
