Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct in Glass House Mountains is in such demand, council has increased its opening hours.

From 7 April, the doors opened longer than ever before, Wednesday to Sunday from 10am to 3pm, (previously Friday to Sunday). Admission is free.

Visitors can enjoy tours of the historic house, exhibitions in the Mary Grigor Centre, open lawns where they can throw down a rug and enjoy a picnic with the most stunning mountain views, large wooden games and a brand new virtual reality experience.

Guests are greeted on arrival by the smiling faces of the Bankfoot volunteers - the life-blood of the precinct. These dedicated heritage heroes, share the stories and bring history to life.

But with longer hours, comes the need for more volunteers, so in the words of the proverbial Lord Kitchener war posters, Bankfoot House needs you!

Bankfoot House, established in 1868, was a lunch stop and staging post on the Cobb & Co coach line between Brisbane and the Gympie goldfields.

Travellers used Bankfoot House as an overnight stop and somewhere to feed and stable their horse.

When the railway came in the early 1890s, the coach and postal service became unviable. Bankfoot continued on as an accommodation house, catering for climbers to the region.

The property remained with the same family across three generations with the Grigor, Burgess and Ferris families occupying the house for more than 130 years.

The last resident of Bankfoot House, Jack Ferris, died in 2002 at the age of 101.

The council of the time purchased the house and contents from the Ferris family in 2004 with a commitment to establishing the property as a House Museum.
