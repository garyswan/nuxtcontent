The Australian Outrigger Canoe Racing Association (AOCRA), host partner Mooloolaba Outrigger Canoe Club and major sponsor Sunshine Coast Council are proud to announce this year’s annual National Marathon Championships 2023.

### Set to take place on Friday 26 through to Sunday 28 May 2023.  

Over 930 competitors alone from across Australia, will compete in these annual National Titles in what promises to be an exciting and competitive three day event.

The event will feature nine races over the three days starting with the launch of the Aussie Va’a Solo V1 16 kms and 10 kms and OC1/2 National Championships 18km and 10kms on Friday with over 240 individuals competing. 

Saturday and Sunday are OC6 team racing with over 270 teams of 6 paddlers across all race divisions: mixed, women's, and men's and age categories from U16 through to Platinum teams.

The annual National Marathon Championships were held at Mooloolaba Spit Park in prior years pre-covid and we are thrilled to be showcasing our event again at this spectacular location.

The Sunshine Coast is an amazing destination for our paddling community with loads of attractions to explore, places to eat and enjoy the natural beauty.  

"We are thrilled to be hosting the National Marathon Championships in partnership with Mooloolaba Outrigger Canoe Club," said Michael Seay, President of AOCRA.

"Outrigger canoe racing is a popular water sport in Australia, and the ocean out from Mooloolaba Spit Park offers fantastic long-distance racing with several course options available. 

"With club teams from around Australia competing, this year's event promises to be fast and challenging with such a strong field on the start line.”
