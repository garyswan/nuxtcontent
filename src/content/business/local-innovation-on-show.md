Congratulations to the 17 Sunshine Coast businesses who shared their new product, service or digital solution to enhance performance and improve business at the 2021 Innovations Day.

The audience included leaders, executives, project designers, and procurement officers from across some of Sunshine Coastâ€™s major private and public organisations, all interested in investigating and adopting new and innovative solutions.

Following the success of Sunshine Coast Innovations Day in 2021, the regional innovation showcase event will return in 2022.

Watch what these innovators had to say by visiting council's [website](https://invest.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Innovation/Sunshine-Coast-Innovations-Day)
