A group of Sunshine Coast residents have joined a new community reference group (CRG) to guide future opportunities for the community to have a say on developing a new planning scheme.

Put simply, a planning scheme is a set of planning principles prepared by council to guide what can be built and where. It is about making sure the right development happens in the right locations.

The CRG will provide input on the best ways to engage with our community on matters such as managing future growth and development as part of the new planning scheme project.

The members provide a broad representation, from a range of areas of interest, gender, age groups, communities and locations across our region:

*   Karen Neuendorf (Chair)
*   Robert Elliot
*   Louise Formosa
*   Carl Nancarrow
*   Stephen Burton
*   Melva Hobson
*   Trevor Rice
*   Narelle McCarthy
*   Gunter Nolle
*   Abbey Lindley

These representatives, will provide expertise and insight in education and community services, environment, business and tourism as well as youth perspectives.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the diversity of skills and expertise of the members would provide valuable input to engaging with the wider community about the development of the new planning scheme.

“Council thanks everyone who showed an interest in the future of our region by nominating for the CRG,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The project is in the early stages, and I look forward to the diverse mix of skills, knowledge, and experience the CRG will bring to the project.

“The CRG’s first task will be to assist with preparing for preliminary community consultation, which will be held later this financial year.

“Council will keep the community informed as engagement ideas are further developed.”

New Sunshine Coast Planning Scheme Project Community Reference Group Chair Karen Neuendorf said she was delighted to be selected to chair the group.

“I’m thrilled to see such a broad group of people of all ages and from all walks of life coming together, to play a part in helping develop a new planning scheme,” Mrs Neuendorf said.

“It’s so important to me that we hear from all the voices that make up our growing community and to do so using new and innovative ways.

“Our first meeting was held last night and, if I can speak on behalf of the group, we are all looking forward to helping council plan for the preliminary engagement opportunities for individuals and organisations to contribute to our region’s future.”

Under the *Planning Act 2016*, all local governments are required to review their planning schemes within 10 years of them taking effect and decide, based on that review, whether to amend or replace the planning scheme.

Council’s Group Executive Customer Engagement and Planning Services James Ruprai said that in partnership with the community, council will spend the next few years developing a new planning scheme to shape future land use and development across the region.

“The community will have the opportunity to have their say during preliminary consultation later this year or early next year,” Mr Ruprai said.

“The outcomes of the preliminary consultation will be used to inform preparation of a draft version of the new planning scheme, which will also welcome community feedback.”

The new planning scheme is intended to be in place by 2024.
