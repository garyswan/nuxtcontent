New job opportunities are up for grabs on the Sunshine Coast as the region bounces back from the impacts of COVID and the economy gains momentum.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said it was great to see business confidence continue to strengthen.

“The collaborative approach between business, industry and all levels of government that the Sunshine Coast is so well known for, has ensured that our economy remained resilient during recent disruptions and enabled our region to thrive through change,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“There are of course still many challenges ahead, but the job opportunities available at these leading local businesses are a great example of the lifestyle and opportunities that exist here on the Sunshine Coast.” 

Many Sunshine Coast businesses currently recruiting include Kunda Park based business [Country Chef](https://www.countrychef.com.au/)
&#x20;which has had up to 40 positions to fill in recent months, with multiple jobs currently advertised for machine operators, electricians and warehousing.

Team Youi

Businesses coming back online, including the aviation industry, are on the hunt for human resources as well.

[Sunshine Coast Airport](https://www.sunshinecoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-us/employment/)
&#x20;is returning to higher numbers of employees, anticipating an increase over the next 12 months. Further job creation is also expected with the new low-cost airline, Bonza, set to start operations later this year.

Sunshine Coast Airport General Manager Corporate Communications Kylie Ezzy said it was an exciting time to be working at Sunshine Coast Airport.

“With travel high on the agenda for many Australians, we are recruiting for a range of roles in our team to support the growth in the number of people travelling to and from the Sunshine Coast and the increase in services and destinations we will connect to in the future,” Ms Ezzy said.

“We are also looking at recruiting for a range of roles that will help us shape our airport in the lead up to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games such as the redevelopment of our terminal which is planned to double in size.

“We are proud of the role we play in our region as an economic enabler and our plans are about ensuring that we are creating jobs for generations to come.”

Sunshine Coast Council currently has the [Gap Year](https://gapyearsunshinecoast.com.au/)
&#x20;campaign running out-of-region for tourism and hospitality positions and Mayor Jamieson, in partnership with Study Sunshine Coast, recently [welcomed international students](https://oursc.com.au/business/sunshine-coast-welcomes-back-international-students)
&#x20;back to the region.

Growth sectors during COVID, such as digital and technology-driven businesses, continue to power on, and so does the need for highly skilled staff.

[Auto & General](https://www.autogeneral.com.au/careers)
&#x20;has a range of IT related positions advertised on its website.

In late 2021, A\&G leased space at ‘The Edge’ in Birtinya, with plans to accommodate a further 400 full time equivalent (FTE) positions.

This would bring total staff employed within the region to at least 700 FTE, making the company one of the larger private employers on the Sunshine Coast.
