What does the Sunshine Coast have in common with Binh Dulong Smart City in Vietnam, Curitiba in Brazil and Coral Gables in the United States?

We are all winners on a global stage when it comes to digital innovation, workforce development, business investment, sustainability and fostering community success.

For the fourth consecutive year, the Sunshine Coast has been heralded as a 2023 Top7 Intelligent Community.

The esteemed status was awarded by New York based Intelligent Community Forum (ICF).

The Top7 represent models of economic and social transformation in the 21st Century which demonstrate best practices in broadband deployment and use, workforce development, innovation, digital inclusion and advocacy that offer lessons to regions, cities, towns and villages around the world. 

### In alphabetical order, the 2023 Top7 Intelligent Communities are:

ICF co-founder Louis Zacharilla said the 2023 group of winners was the most mature and diverse group of Top7 communities in the ICF Awards program.

“Most have been working on their digital and acceleration programs for years and have made historic progress for their nations.”

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the recognition gave the Sunshine Coast an amazing opportunity to showcase everything the region had to offer to a global audience.

“Being recognised among the Top7 Intelligent Communities for the fourth year in a row reinforces the impact and value of Sunshine Coast Council’s regional economic, environment and community strategies,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The accolade is a huge testament to Council’s long-term strategy delivered in partnership with the community, education and industry leaders over many years.

“It also showcases the important work being done as part of the [Regional Economic Development Strategy 2013-2033](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033#:~:text=The%20strategy%20provides%20a%2020,local%20residents%20and%20businesses%20alike)
&#x20;to position the Sunshine Coast as Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative.”

In October 2023, the ICF will determine which of the Top7 finalists will be named the prestigious Intelligent Community of Year for 2023 based on a second round of analysis, including site visits by ICF's judges and the assessment of an international jury.
