It’s time to mark your diaries for a unique festival week that celebrates Sunshine Coast produce, culinary artistry and music against the backdrop of the region’s stunning natural environment.

The Curated Plate 2023 is ready to deliver a full serve of special experiences that will showcase an array of amazing local products and inspired foodie talents.

To launch the Curated Plate program for 2023, we are pleased to announce three confirmed ‘signature’ events that will warm the winter months, between July 28 to August 6, 2023.

‘MooloolaBARS’ a one-day beer and beverage event across Mooloolaba venues and bars.

MooloolaBARS Event Director Craig Williams said the Sunshine Coast was a truly magical part of the world.

“For those of us lucky enough to make beer, gin or rum here, I think we all try and put a little of that magic into each glass,” Mr Williams said.

“The MooloolaBARS festival will be one epic celebration of Sunshine Coast craft beer, gin, food and music, moving from one bar to the next along the stunning Mooloolaba waterfront.”

Spicers Tamarind will present The Sunshine Coast Asian Food Festival at their Maleny restaurant and bring together three iconic Asian restaurants on the Sunshine Coast – Sum Yung Guys, Spirit House and Rice Boi.

General manager Ryan Dillon said Spicers Tamarind Retreat was thrilled to be again hosting the Sunshine Coast Asian Food Festival as part of the Curated Plate Festival. 

“We’re excited to be showcasing the amazing produce that is on offer here on the Sunshine Coast and show why Asian food works so well with our sub-tropical climate,” Mr Dillon said.

General Manager Rod Winner said 91.1 Hot FM would host the free, family-friendly From Paddock to Curated Plate event, giving foodies of all ages the opportunity to touch, experience and taste the best of our own backyard.

The free public event will be held at Cotton Tree where foodies of all ages enjoy an immersive journey that will showcase the Sunshine Coast food scene.  

There are many more culinary events yet to come as local businesses put forward their own events and ideas.

The Curated Plate is FREE for businesses to participate and those involved retain all revenue.

It also offers collaboration opportunities with other businesses, including local producers, restaurants, cafes and tourism operators.  Now is the time to get involved and applications close February 28, 2023. Industry Partner information: [thecuratedplate.com.au](http://thecuratedplate.com.au)

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the annual food celebration would shine a spotlight on the wide range of quality food and beverages produced locally, amidst the setting of our unique coastal and hinterland locations. 

“We want locals and visitors to immerse themselves in the flavours of the region and connect with growers, producers, and chefs through memorable experiences,” Cr O’Pray said. 

“Food tourism offers creative opportunities for the Sunshine Coast, so we are keen to connect with businesses in our food and agribusiness, tourism and hospitability industries.

“Capitalising on the success of last year’s industry-driven model to deliver collaborative events, we really hope to see more than 100 local businesses participate in this festival in some way – whether a producer, tourism operator or an event supplier.

“From young legends and refined chefs to the finest Queensland produce, we’re inviting Sunshine Coast-based restaurants, venues, wineries, breweries, tourism operators, musicians and food trucks who can offer a quality food event that features Sunshine Coast produce or products to be part of the festival.”
