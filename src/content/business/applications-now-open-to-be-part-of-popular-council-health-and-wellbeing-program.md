Sunshine Coast Council is calling on businesses and community groups in the health and wellbeing industry to work together with council to deliver the Healthy Sunshine Coast program.

Healthy Sunshine Coast is an affordable and holistic community health and wellbeing program that supports and encourages our community to move well, eat well, sleep well, think well and relate well.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Healthy Sunshine Coast program aimed to foster a happier, healthier, more connected and resilient Sunshine Coast community.

“The program launched in 2016 and has had great success over the past seven years with activities including yoga, Tai Chi, boxing and more,” Cr Law said.

“I’m encouraging businesses and community groups in the wellbeing and health industry to express their interest to help us provide a wide range of affordable activities to the Sunshine Coast community. We are seeking a variety of weekly entry level, low-to-medium impact fitness and wellbeing activities for individuals of all ages and abilities to be held in different localities across the region.

“We are hoping to relaunch the program in the spring season and we need a variety of health and wellbeing providers to run the activities.”  

The aim of the program is to encourage:

*   positive mental health and resilience
*   regular physical activity
*   healthy eating
*   strong social connections
*   participation across all ages and abilities.

Get involved and help everyone on the Sunshine Coast become more healthy and active!

Benefits include promotion on Healthy Sunshine Coast’s communication platforms, increasing your business profile, retention of participant fee and other opportunities.  Providers will receive a payment per session and council will cover costs associated with facility hire/outdoor permit (subject to conditions and negotiation).

Applications close Friday, 30 September. For more information please visit [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast/Become-a-General-Service-Provider)
