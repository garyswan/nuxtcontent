Hundreds of jobs that allow you to live and work in the best place in Australia are on offer via a clever – and free – new platform.

If you are looking for new employment opportunities, a career change or position closer to home, the [Sunshine Coast Jobs Hub](https://www.scjobs.com.au/)
&#x20;is the place to go.

It’s also a must for employers looking to secure local talent.

The Jobs Hub, created through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council and [Study Sunshine Coast](https://www.studysunshinecoast.com.au/)
, already has more than 700 opportunities listed.

It’s free for businesses to advertise their job opportunities, and it also aggregates employment opportunities from other job sites to showcase roles specifically located on the Sunshine Coast.

The one-stop-platform features information, insights and opportunities on the region’s high value industries and employers from tourism and hospitality to health, education, manufacturing and more.

Jobs up for grabs include a chef’s position at Maleny for $80,000, a payroll manager at Maroochydore for $116,000, a watersports instructor at Caloundra for between $55,000-$66,000 and a landscape labourer at Buderim for $29 per hour.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Jobs Hub is an important initiative to boost business and industry growth and attract, retain and develop talent in the region – consistent with the intent of the Sunshine Coast Regional Economic Development Strategy.

“Over the past few years, we’ve heard from so many employers about the difficulty in finding staff, and that’s why council has worked closely with local business and industry representatives to develop the Jobs Hub,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The Jobs Hub showcases an impressive range of job and career opportunities at all levels, from casual and part-time work through to full-time roles.

“I encourage all local businesses to use this free online platform to recruit staff as well as attract new workers to our region.

“If you live local or you are interested in re-locating to our Sunshine Coast, then sign up to see the amazing work, lifestyle and study experiences on offer.”

An extension of the Sunshine Coast Jobs Hub is the [Sunshine Coast Student Jobs Hub,](https://www.scstudentjobs.com.au/)
&#x20;[](https://www.scstudentjobs.com.au/)
which connects students and graduates with industry and job opportunities on the Sunshine Coast.

Study Sunshine Coast Program Director Tracey Coobula said the Sunshine Coast was a great place to study and live, and a great place for students to work and kick-start their career.

“Students and graduates can use the Sunshine Coast Student Jobs Hub to search the latest job opportunities, and they can also upload their CV through AirCV so employers in the region can find them when suitable roles arise,” Mrs Coobula said.
