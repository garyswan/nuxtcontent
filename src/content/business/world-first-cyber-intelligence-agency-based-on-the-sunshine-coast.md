The Sunshine Coast has become home to a world-first initiative which will unite industries and organisations with critical infrastructure in the fight against cyber-attacks.\
 \
The [Critical Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (CI-ISAC)](https://ci-isac.com.au/)
, is a new not-for profit entity providing organisations with a platform to share intelligence on getting ahead of and defeating cyber-attacks.

CI-ISAC is inviting membership from a range of critical infrastructure sectors including energy, communications, financial services, education and transport and government.

With the diversity, sophistication, and sheer volume of cyber-attacks growing each day it is hard for any one organisation to stand against the onslaught of attacks, but by taking a cross-sectoral approach to information-sharing Australia's vital industries will gain a competitive edge.

### Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson said CI-ISAC is currently the only cross-sectoral ISAC in the world and it would add great value to the region’s unique entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.

“When Council first invested in the undersea cable, our goal was that the region would be able to offer a diverse range of tech jobs including threat intelligence, intelligence briefings and cyber security. Today it is a reality.

“It will be great to see the centre taking a pro-active approach to assist and enable organisations to not fall victim to cybercrime.

“As a manager of key infrastructure in the region there was absolute value for our community to have Sunshine Coast Council signed up as a founding member.

“The services provided by this new centre will be valuable to all councils across Australia, including the managers of water, power, airports, hospitals and other assets and I encourage them to sign up to be members to create real strength in this area.”

### Strength in numbers

CI-ISAC Co-Founder Scott Flower PhD said CI-ISAC was established to create an ecosystem and enabling tools to support the cyber defence of organisations covered by the Australian Government's Security of Critical Infrastructure (SOCI) Act 2018.

“The strength of the CI-ISAC model comes through the knowledge that cyber criminals often use the same techniques to not only target organisations within a specific industry sector, but across other sectors,” Mr Flower said.

“Membership in CI-ISAC provides organisations with the opportunity to participate in what will become Australia's largest network for sharing intelligence on threats and collectively building cyber tools to defend our national interests.

“A real challenge for business leaders in these critical sectors is knowing how best to invest in appropriate cyber defences,

“By joining CI-ISAC they will gain access to knowledge and practical advice that can prevent them becoming the latest statistic in the never-ending war against cyber criminals.”

### Experts in Action

[CI-ISAC](https://ci-isac.com.au/)
&#x20;Chief Executive Officer David Sandell said the not-for-profit is led by a team with extensive experience building cyber defences across both the public and private sectors.

Mr Sandell said the key differentiators for organisation would be the focus on helping drive operational outcomes by gathering information on threats from across the 12 industry sectors and adding context to improve risk-based decision making for members.

“CI-ISAC combines our technical expertise with industry knowledge and insights to support the needs of all members, with a key pledge being to leave no member behind.”
