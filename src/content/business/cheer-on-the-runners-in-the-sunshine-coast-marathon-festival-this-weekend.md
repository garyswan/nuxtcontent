This Sunday, Australia’s best runners will join with regular peeps giving it a go on Sunshine Coast streets for the Sunshine Coast Marathon and Community Run Festival featuring the 2022 Australian Half Marathon Championships.

This major community event will benefit the health and tourism of our region and bring much needed funds to charities.

While the heart of the event is situated in Alexandra Headland, the course winds its way through some local streets and main roads in Alexandra Headland, Bli Bli, Buderim, Cotton Tree, Diddillibah, Forest Glen, Kuluin, Marcoola, Maroochydore and Mooloolaba.

Check out the map to see if they’ll be running past your area.

**Changed traffic conditions**

This year the course has some route alterations and there will be road closures, parking restrictions and public transport changes.
