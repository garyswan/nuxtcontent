The Sunshine Coast is going for gold as a world-class sporting and events capital.

A clever new website has been launched that will seamlessly link high-performance sporting teams and event organisers from across the nation and globe with local venues, allied health professionals and a range of other suppliers.

[EventsConnect](https://eventsconnect.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;is an initiative of the Sunshine Coast Events Industry Association, which is delivered and managed by Sunshine Coast Council.

Sunshine Coast-based businesses that service the sports and events industry, including allied health, catering, photography, training facilities, sports equipment and venues can [register for free](https://eventsconnect.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/page/supplier-listing-guidelines)
&#x20;and list their business.

The business-to-business messaging feature on the new website gives listed suppliers the opportunity to transfer and share knowledge and resources, which are important for developing innovation, competitiveness, and resilience. 

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Cr Jason O’Pray said a number of elite sporting teams, in addition to Commonwealth and Olympic Games teams from a number of countries, had benefitted from training, staying and playing on the Sunshine Coast as part of their preparations.

Cr O’Pray said enquiries and opportunities of this nature would only grow in coming years.

“As we prepare for the role the region will play in the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympics, we see EventsConnect as a great way to improve awareness of the region’s venues, facilities, capabilities and reputation.

“It will also increase interest and enquiries from event organisers and sporting organisations to host events, competition and training camps in our region.

“Sunshine Coast Council’s Tourism and Major Events team will share this new website with their existing and potential major event organiser network as an ongoing tool to promote local business services.”

Sunshine Coast Events Industry Association Chair Lenny Vance said the local events industry made valuable and vibrant contributions to the Sunshine Coast’s lifestyles and economy.

“Our events industry association was established to support the growth of the industry and we applaud Sunshine Coast Council for backing the establishment of EventsConnect,” Mr Vance said.

“We encourage all local events industry suppliers and sports services to register their businesses on the site so that it becomes a powerful directory to drive exposure and revenue opportunities across the weddings, business, community and sporting events sectors.”
