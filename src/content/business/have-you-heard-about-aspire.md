It’s a FREE online marketplace connecting businesses to exchange waste as a resource and build our circular economy.

All you have to do is list items your business no longer wants and find items you do – it’s possible that your business’s waste stream could be another one’s resource, and if we can make those connections and avoid waste going to landfill, it’s a win-win.

This green solution is a great opportunity for our local businesses to unlock new business potential, save on disposal costs or create new revenue streams - and help the environment along the way.

ASPIRE is free to Sunshine Coast businesses with an ABN and up to 100 full-time staff, and schools and community groups.

Council is partnering with businesses across the region to embed innovative sustainability practices and support new business opportunities.

Find out more and sign-up via council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Circular-Economy?utm_source=corporate&utm_medium=spotlights&utm_campaign=Aspire)
