Are you ready to take your digital skills to the Next Level?

In an effort to future-proof the region’s digital capability, [Next Level](https://nextlevelsc.com.au/)
&#x20;is a free, online cyber security and digital training course made available thanks to a Sunshine Coast Council collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and TAFE Queensland and supported by technology industry group Silicon Coast.

The new cutting-edge training program was launched today (25 May) offering a series of specialist digital skills training courses available to Sunshine Coast residents online, and on demand at a time that suits the trainee.

The course will build new, job ready skills in the areas of cloud computing, cyber security, and application and software development.

Students, business owners, ICT professionals and anyone interested in pursuing a technology career can participate in the training.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was delighted to support this digital upskilling collaboration with AWS.

“Next Level will support the region’s continued economic recovery and places a strong focus on developing Sunshine Coast residents’ current and future skill sets,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This is one of a suite of initiatives council is supporting through our Economic Resurgence Plan to help future proof our workforce.

“This digital education program aims to ensure our workforce and our entrepreneurs are equipped with the skills that are increasingly required in the digital global economy.

“This suite of training, combined with our region’s global connectivity through the International Broadband Submarine Cable Network, makes the Sunshine Coast the perfect choice for local and remote workers to upskill, and for companies looking to on-shore their services and systems.”

Iain Rouse, Director, Australia and New Zealand Public Sector for AWS, said he was excited to be working with the Sunshine Coast Council and TAFE Queensland to pioneer this upskilling opportunity.

“Technology is redefining the Australian workforce and the skills needed to remain competitive. Courses such as Next Level provide accessible skill development to meet the current and future demand for digital careers in our communities,” Mr Rouse said.

“We need tomove away from the ‘business as usual’ ways of learning to lift our baseline. Programs like Next Level are a great way to provide skills training that can be achieved in hours, and credentials that can be achieved in days.

“AWS is committed to supporting skills training to help Australians advance their careers and open up a variety of career paths, including for individuals with little-to-no previous tech knowledge.”

Research commissioned by Amazon Web Services predicts Australia will need 6.5 million new skilled and reskilled digital workers by 2025, an increase of 79 per cent of the existing workforce. The average Australian worker will need to develop seven new digital skills within the next five years to keep pace with technology advancements and demand.\[1]

The majority of new skills will be required by new job seekers, those involuntarily excluded from the workforce, and workers who do not use digital skills in their jobs today. Access to these skills will enhance employability and drive innovation.
