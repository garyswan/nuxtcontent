Kunda Park based business Raider Targetry, is advancing defence training with innovations in high fidelity live fire training targets. Raider relocated to the Sunshine Coast in 2020 where the business has worked with a highly capable manufacturing industry. 

Raider found initial support through the Manufacturing Excellence Forum who introduced them to a network of businesses across the region. This support helped Raider secure 80 per cent of their supply network within the first six months of arriving on the coast. Operating near suppliers has made it easier for Raider to meet and work closely with their network to deliver quality products. 

Now expanding, Raider is sourcing local talent through industry groups to build a well-rounded workforce. Local students have been gaining industry experience through Raider internships while making meaningful contributions to the workforce. The region’s focus on STEM education has provided Raider with quality interns with some going on to employment. This focus on local talent development is contributing to strengthening the workforce on the Sunshine Coast. 

Raider Targetry has been named a Local Business Champion in this series which highlights businesses in the region that support local. [Read more LBC stories](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Local-business-champions-2022)
