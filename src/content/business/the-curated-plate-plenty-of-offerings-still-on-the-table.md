Organisers of The Curated (side) Plate have supported Maleny Dairies’ difficult decision to cancel their event scheduled for this Saturday, in light of the Foot and Mouth Disease situation in Australia.

The culinary food festival’s ‘Celebrating Maleny Dairy Producers’ event was cancelled as a proactive precautionary biosecurity measure to protect the health and wellbeing of the cows and calves in our local area.

Although the intention is to announce a new date for this event to take place, outside of The Curated (side) Plate 2022 schedule, ticketholders have been contacted directly and refunds issued.

More than 100 The Curated Plate events will still offer a taste of the Sunshine Coast to locals, intrastate, interstate and international visitors. Only a handful of tickets remain for popular events across the 10-day festival.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said council respected the decision of the local organisers and appreciated the importance of biosecurity.

“The good news is there are still plenty of locations, activities, menus and price points to suit everyone, and many hidden gems to surprise visitors and locals,” Cr Landsberg said.

“I encourage everyone to taste a bit of the Sunshine Coast and support our local businesses and producers given there are more than 400 food tourism operators on the Sunshine Coast.”
