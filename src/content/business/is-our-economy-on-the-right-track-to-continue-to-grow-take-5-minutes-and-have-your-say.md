After a period of significant growth and change within our region, the 2023 review of the [Regional Economic Development Strategy (2013-2033)](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033)
&#x20;provides an opportunity for local business and industry to have input into the next 10 years of economic development. 

Council adopted the [Sunshine Coast - Natural Advantage: Regional Economic Development Strategy](https://invest.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/regional_economic_development_strategy_2013.pdf)
&#x20;(REDS) in September 2013 to provide a 20-year vision and blueprint for sustainable economic growth.

Developed in consultation with leading business, industry and university representatives and the Queensland Government, the REDS outlines a comprehensive agenda to improve the resilience and strength of the regional economy and position the Sunshine Coast as one of Australia's leading regions.

Now reaching the midpoint in time for the REDS, Sunshine Coast Council is urging local businesses and industry groups [to have their say](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QK6D2YG)
&#x20;on the future direction of the Strategy.

![](https://preview-assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c631baf8-1b46-001f-580c-d0001b68b4a8/9a88092d-2a80-4c43-9b77-0b5e4005fe86/230220092435_BJA4726-1-1024x600.jpg)

Saltwater Eco Tours Managing Director Simon Thornalley, White House International Director Min Swan, Sunshine Coast Council Head of Economic Development Andrew Eves-Brown and HeliMods CEO Will Shrapnel at the REDS Town Hall Information Session.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the REDS review came at a critical time for the Sunshine Coast.

“This is an ideal time to re-position the region for the next 10 years - considering the diversification of the regional economy, strong population growth, delivery of significant infrastructure projects, changing global trade and supply chains and the flows of capital investment to the region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Since the REDS was adopted, the Sunshine Coast economy has grown by more than 31 per cent and outpaced Southeast Queensland.

“Household income levels have improved significantly from 22.3 per cent below the state average to today’s result of 4.7 per cent below.

“The growth in regional productivity is now twice the rate of Southeast Queensland.

“While the strategy has provided the framework for economic growth and diversification over the past 10 years, this halfway mark is a critical time to hear from our business community.

“We need to ensure we are on the right track to achieving continued economic growth and work towards becoming Australia's most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative.”

The 2023 REDS Review will also take into consideration the future opportunities and challenges associated with:

*   the ongoing economic impacts of the COVID19 global pandemic,
*   the opportunities to leverage Queensland’s successful bid to host the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games
*   the opportunities from Sunshine Coast being officially recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Local businesses are encouraged to [complete the short five-minute survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QK6D2YG)
&#x20;and share their thoughts and feedback across a range of topics and issues that will help inform the future and direction of the REDS.

Businesses who complete the survey will also go into a draw to win an iPad.

The survey closes at midnight on March 7, 2023.
