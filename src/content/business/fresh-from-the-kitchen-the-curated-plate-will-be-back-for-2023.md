Planning is now underway for next year’s The Curated Plate culinary festival on the Sunshine Coast, with event dates confirmed for July 28-August 6, 2023.

To get a jump start on next year’s event, on November 14, an information session will be held for local businesses and producers seeking to learn about the festival, the benefits for industry and the community and to understand the opportunities available to link into the food tourism market.

Earlier this year, The Curated (side) Plate 2022 offered up a smaller ‘serving’ of events, whetting the appetite for both industry and food lovers for a food tourism event on the Sunshine Coast.

The 10-day festival menu featured 91 events, hosted by 42 industry partners from the coast to the hinterland, demonstrating that Sunshine Coast businesses and producers are hungry for opportunities to thrive through changing times.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said this year’s success was thanks to strong collaborations with industry partners.

“The positive results were thanks to our partnership with our local food producers, our venues including farms, breweries and boats, our tourism operators and the Food & Agribusiness Network, Visit Sunshine Coast and Tourism and Events Queensland,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Winter is always a great time of year for the event to attract visitors and keep our tourism operators busy in the low season.

“Hosting an annual food celebration gives our region the opportunity to shine a spotlight on the wide range of quality food and beverages produced on the Sunshine Coast to a national audience, amidst the setting of our unique coastal and hinterland locations.”

Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said The Curated Plate was building back better.

“It is terrific to see events like The Curated Plate going from strength to strength and showcasing Queensland’s great lifestyle,” Mr Hinchliffe said.

“When visitors experience The Curated Plate’s tantalising flavours, they also support Sunshine Coast accommodation and tourism providers and Queensland jobs.

“That’s why the Palaszczuk Government is helping to keep The Curated Plate on the Sunshine Coast’s 2023 events menu through Tourism and Events Queensland’s Major Events Program.”

The Food & Agribusiness Network spokesperson Nicole McNaughton said FAN was delighted to work with the Sunshine Coast Council again as an industry partner for The Curated Plate in 2023.

“It will be a FANtastic showcase of our region’s growers, makers, brewers, distillers and collaborative community,” Ms McNaughton said.

“Telling the Sunshine Coast’s food story is a strategic industry priority and The Curated Plate allows us to serve up some tasty tid bits, with the event a platform for industry partners to work together and reach new audiences."
