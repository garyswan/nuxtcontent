Funds are being made available to help a historic Sunshine Coast town create a more powerful – and lucrative – first impression.

The move is aimed at boosting businesses and improving the experience for shoppers at Nambour.

It’s just one of the many initiatives reigniting the former sugar town, which is redefining itself as a heritage, arts and music hub.

Improvements that could be made thanks to the Sunshine Coast Council investment could range from a fresh coat of paint to eye-catching signage, well-lit displays, vibrant greenery or better accessibility.

Funding is now available to assist Nambour town centre business owners with the cost of upgrading the “aesthetic, vibrancy and attractiveness’’ of shopfronts to attract more customers.

Council will support matched funding up to a maximum contribution of $5,000.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said Council was committed to investing in the Nambour business district.

“As a dedicated gateway precinct, Council wants to ensure the Nambour business district welcomes visitors with attractive commercial streetscapes that encourage customers to shop and explore,” Cr Law said.

"The appearance of our town, our businesses and the surrounding streets creates a powerful first impression.

“It’s a challenging time for many local businesses so we’re encouraging them to apply now for a grant to help increase footfall and patronage with customers.”

The program is ongoing, and applications will be reviewed and assessed in the order they are received until budget is expended.

### What types of improvements can be made?

*   Repainting external shop frontage
*   Improvements to advertising signage
*   Adding external materials and treatments
*   Improving accessibility for all users
*   Adding greening elements
*   Improvements to frontages to interact with the street
*   Removing security shutters and replacing with glass or security glazing
*   Improving under awnings
*   Removing fixed outdoor dining furniture and replacement with non‐fixed furniture
*   Internal and external display lighting

Council is also leading the [Nambour (Namba) Place Revitalisation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Nambour-Centre-Activation-Project/Nambour-Place-Revitalisation-Project)
, a precinct-wide concept design and implementation plan that will shape Nambour’s town centre.

Monthly Nambour Forecourt Live! events, jointly presented by Sunshine Coast Council and Peace Run Records are also delivered on the last Friday of each month offering live music, food trucks, facepainting and art and craft workshops.

Nambour’s Village Square Market takes place on Lowe Street every Thursday from 9am to 2pm offering shabby chic designs, fresh produce, plants and much more.
