One of Australia’s leading manufacturer and supplier of steel building products has shown its confidence in the Sunshine Coast, investing in a new $10 million facility in Bells Creek.  

[Metroll](https://www.metroll.com.au/)
&#x20;established its Sunshine Coast branch 22 years ago and is part of a large national network which has 29 branches spread across every state in Australia.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson officially opened\* the new facility and thanked Metroll for its contribution to the region.

“This is an exciting expansion for Metroll, which recently moved from their existing 1000m2 shed in Warana to a new 9000m2 facility in Bells Creek,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Metroll’s commitment to the Sunshine Coast region is evident through its philosophy of ‘keeping it local’, enlisting Marcoola building design company, Building Suncoast Green for the building design and local commercial and industrial building company, Karloo Constructions at Kunda Park for the construction of their $10 million capital works project.

“Council is pleased to have been able to provide business and development support to Metroll and I congratulate the company on its success.”

Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowksi said it was exciting to see Metroll’s expansion into the Sunshine Coast Industrial Park (SCIP).

"The location of SCIP, particularly its proximity to the Bruce Highway, makes it an ideal headquarters for companies such as Metroll which require easy access to Brisbane and other major markets to the north," Cr Baberowski said.

Metroll manufactures steel roofing, cladding, rainwater, structural and fencing products and ships to national and international residential and commercial markets.

Metroll's new facility in the Sunshine Coast Industrial Park

Metroll Sunshine Coast Branch Manager Jason Hawthorne said moving to the new facility would allow for employee growth.

“We hope to see our current staff of 20 employees potentially grow to 100 full-time positions at full capacity,” Mr Hawthorne said.

“We’re hiring to fill 10 new positions right now. So, if you have experience in manufacturing, truck driving or loading and live on the Sunshine Coast we’d love to hear from you.  

“The new facility delivers increased manufacturing capacity allowing us to increase the volume of product we deliver to market.

“Combined with increased product storage, we’re in a great position to leverage the local supply chain and realise our future vision to export from the Sunshine Coast in the future.”

**Fast facts:**

*   One full-time employee produces enough roofing sheets to cover 20 standard residential homes per day
*   The new facility boasts manufacturing equipment which can produce 35 metre roof sheets – a huge increase from the current capacity of 13 metre roof sheets
*   35 metre sheets are the longest that can be legally transported by road in Queensland.  
*   Metroll Sunshine Coast manufactures locally approximately 750kms or 3000 tonnes of roof sheeting per annum.
*   Sustainable benefits have been incorporated into the Metroll’s new building’s design ensuring it is a fire-isolated building utilising natural ventilation.  The natural ventilation feature maintains comfortable working conditions year-round, while providing essential benefits in the event of a fire, emergency or evacuation.
