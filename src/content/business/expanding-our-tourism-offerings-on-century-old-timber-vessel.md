Local Saltwater man Simon Thornalley has combined his passion for the ocean, Indigenous culture and extensive maritime experience into a unique tourism venture on the Sunshine Coast.

Launched in early 2020, Saltwater Eco Tours focuses on sustainable tourism and providing authentic experiences aboard the 100-year-old timber vessel Spray of the Coral Coast based in Mooloolaba.

Simon Thornalley.

Simon, a young First Nations man of Torres Strait Island descent, was born on the Sunshine Coast and introduced to sailing by his parents who were world class sailors and adventurers.

He continued his passion through commercial diving, maritime operations and being a skipper.

This love of the ocean inspired his vision to establish an eco-tourism business which he developed in consultation with the Kabi Kabi peoples to share their culture and wisdom of the Sunshine Coast’s ecological diversity.

Simon’s advice to other businesses is: Never give up and stay true to your own vision.
