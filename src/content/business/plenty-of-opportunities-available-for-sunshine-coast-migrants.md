Applications are now open for two Sunshine Coast Council programs designed to give a helping hand to local migrants looking to enter the workforce or expand their small business.

The award-winning\* Migrant Work Ready as well as the Migrant Business Ready Scholarship programs provide participants with practical work ready skills and micro or small businesses to establish and plan for growth.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the programs helped to develop inner personal strengths and created a community of belonging through building self-reliance, confidence and connections.

“The Migrant Work Ready program is now in its fifth year and involves eight employment-ready workshops where professional experts, community organisations, businesses owners and mentors clarify how to prepare for the local job market and improve prospects to find employment,” Cr Law said.

“The Migrant Business Ready Scholarship is back for a second time after its success last year and will involve six business-ready workshops and two personal coaching sessions to connect with the Sunshine Coast business community.

“The Migrant Work Ready program is designed and delivered in collaboration with public and private sectors, including Nambour Community Centre, Maroochydore Chamber of Commerce, TAFE Queensland, Volunteering Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance Business Mentor program and Sunshine Coast Council.

“Expressions of interest are now open with programs to start in September.

“Get ready to find your perfect job or start your dream business. Apply today!”

Camila Mozzini completed the Migrant Business Ready Scholarship program last year and said her experience was very eye-opening.

“The program opened my mind to the business world and Dani, the facilitator was very helpful throughout the process,” Ms Mozzini said.

“We learnt how to connect, plan and organise our business and became aware of any regulations involved.

“I am very thankful for the opportunity to have taken part in the program and encourage others to submit their applications.”

Applications for Migrant Business Ready Scholarship close August 24 and applications for the Migrant Work Ready program close August 29.
