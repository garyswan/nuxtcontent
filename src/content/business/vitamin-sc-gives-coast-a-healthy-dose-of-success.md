Sunshine Coast Council has been named a finalist in two categories of the 2022 National [Economic Development Awards for Excellence](https://www.edaustralia.com.au/ed-awards/)
.

The award winners will be named at a national conference in Sydney in October.

Work undertaken by council’s Economic Development branch earned a final berth in the category "Economic Development Strategic Thinking".

Additional work was recognised when a series of compelling investment attraction videos for the out-of-region target audience was also named a finalist in the "Economic Development Marketing and Promotion" category.

These included the inspirational [video campaign](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpDJ8z7oh58gm70IMseJeKZS0kGJFwAC6)
: ‘Give your business a boost of Vitamin SC’ (Sunshine Coast).

*Another great success was the [behind-the-scenes video](https://youtu.be/RAo5rPhbxRM)
&#x20;offering a fun look at the making of the series as well as commentary from the Investment Attraction team.*

The campaign focussed on how a business could set up operations on the Sunshine Coast and benefit from the high-speed data via the [Sunshine Coast International Broadband Network](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Undersea-Cable)
, the connectivity via the Sunshine Coast Airport’s [new international runway](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Airport-Expansion-Project)
&#x20;and the work-life balance on offer.

The videos have proven to be a huge hit in their chosen market of investment decision makers based largely in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney who saw them as distinctly different from the traditional material they were receiving from other competing regions and more engaging. 

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was extremely proud of the work undertaken by the Economic Development Branch.

“The region has been awarded Smart 21 Global Community eight of nine years and [Top7 Global Intelligent Communities](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Sunshine-Coast-is-on-top-of-the-world-again)
&#x20;three times,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Of more importance, is the everyday work council undertakes for the Sunshine Coast community by steadfastly progressing toward the 2033 goals of the [Regional Economic Development Strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033)
.

“This is done in partnership with a wide range of committed industry partners, stakeholders and supporters from right across the community and for this we are very thankful.”

To assist the region to weather the storm created by COVID-19, a cross-council initiative referred to as the Sunshine Coast Investment Assistance Program (SCIAP) was also delivered.

This was administered by a business response group representing major internal business units to assist large investment projects to proceed and thus the employment opportunities associated with them to continue.

Projects were modelled to have a positive economic impact on the local economy of up to $16 billion and the creation of a possible 5125 new jobs.

Council has also created more high value job opportunities for the community through the attraction of new business to the region that can offer diverse career opportunities.

Past companies attracted to the Sunshine Coast region include Youi, Auto and General, Stellar (now owned by Probe CX), Huddle and others who have since become valued members of the local business community.

In 2019, Sunshine Coast Council received international recognition from the global industry organisation - the International Economic Development Council (IEDC), for council’s promotion of the Sunshine Coast International Broadband Network.

It is the first international award of its kind to be won by a local council in Australia for its promotional efforts.

Local suppliers and products assisted it in council’s activities as it continues to deliver on the [REDS strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033)

&#x20;showcases the many council-delivered programs and initiatives which assisted local businesses through the economic effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and ensured the region had the right support and investment to grow a modern, dynamic and resilient economy.
