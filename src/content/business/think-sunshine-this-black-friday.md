Sunshine Coast businesses have until October 31 to join the movement and make buying local part of the customer conversation ahead of Black Friday sales.

In preparation for the famous sales day, local businesses are encouraged to engage in the [Buy Local Black Friday campaign](https://www.buylocalsunshinecoast.com.au/black-friday)
&#x20;simply by posting a short video on social media and tagging @buylocalsunshinecoast #buylocalsunshinecoast #blackfridaysunshinecoast and #blackfriday.

In doing so, they have a chance to win a marketing pack worth $5000 and be featured in the region-wide campaign.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said it would be great to see all of our retailers and services help motivate locals to think local and buy local.

“With the Black Friday event just four weeks before Christmas, now is the perfect time to engage with consumers as they think about gifts to buy and things to do with loved ones,” Cr O’Pray said.

“When you buy local, you are directly supporting local families, jobs and helping our local economy.” 

It’s no secret Aussies love finding a bargain when it comes to shopping.

In 2021, Australians spent more than $8 billion on Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals[\[i\]](#_edn1)
&#x20;– twice the spend over the Boxing Day weekend.

Traditionally, Black Friday sales coincide with the USA Thanksgiving holiday on November 25 and is now big business in Australia. This year the Sunshine Coast will be ready with customers being encouraged to “Think SUNSHINE” this Black Friday.

Buy Local Sunshine Coast founder Claire Parkinson encouraged the community to support local businesses across the Black Friday sales and into the Christmas period.

“November 25 presents a massive opportunity for our local businesses to provide value to customers and so they keep spending within the Sunshine Coast region,” Ms Parkinson said.

“Supporting a local business has never been so important and, with thousands of amazing businesses here on the Coast, we urge you to think local first.

“Every dollar spent here supports families, neighbours, friends, sporting groups and much more.”

Buy Local Sunshine Coast connects our community with local businesses. It’s an online local business platform to help you find the very best local products, food, and services.

Buy Local Sunshine Coast is supported by council as an initiative of the [Sunshine Coast Regional Economic Development Strategy](https://wcms.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033)
