The region’s most sought-after jobs, industries and locations have been revealed as a new and free site, the [Sunshine Coast Jobs Hub](https://www.scjobs.com.au/)
, is now ready for all job seekers to access.

The Jobs Hub, created through a partnership between Sunshine Coast Council and [Study Sunshine Coast](https://www.studysunshinecoast.com.au/)
, launched to industry in December 2022 to boost business and industry growth and attract, develop and retain talent in the region.

In just three months, the Jobs Hub has attracted close to 1,000 job listings and sparked great interest from early users who are spending an average 3.27 minutes on the site, viewing almost nine pages per session, well above industry benchmarking stats.

Business, Industry, Council and Education representatives will gather to celebrate the initial success of the Jobs Hub at the Holiday Inn at Maroochydore on Friday March 24.

The most sought-after job over the past two months included a program events and social media coordinator at NatureArt Lab in Maroochydore.

This was followed by customer service and contact centre manager roles at IT and Services giant Genpact, glazier position, ranger position, registered nurse at an intensive care unit at Birtinya, surveyor position in Maleny, commercial attendant at Sea Life Mooloolaba, support officer with Sunshine Coast Council and team member at Officeworks, all demonstrating the diversity of jobs on offer.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council had collaborated with business and industry representatives to develop the Jobs Hub as a central tool to help the region thrive.

“We’ve heard from so many employers about the difficulty in finding staff, and it’s really encouraging to see that initial roll out of the site has delivered exceptional results,” Mayor Jamieson said. 

“There are already close to 1,000 jobs listed and this will only improve with the ongoing growth, major projects and infrastructure opportunities on the Sunshine Coast leading up to Brisbane 2032 Olympics and Paralympic Games.

“The Sunshine Coast is the ideal destination to live, work and study and I encourage all local businesses to use the free online Jobs Hub to recruit staff as well as attract new workers to our region.”

Kilcoy Global Foods Vice President for People and Culture Bevan Gibbs said he was delighted Sunshine Coast Council had invested in an innovative online platform to connect local industry with job seekers. 

“The Jobs Hub will play a key role in generating leads as we look to expand our workforce and recruit around 200 new jobs for our manufacturing facility currently being constructed at Caloundra’s Corbould park estate.

“As we get closer to our opening date, we will be advertising a range of new Sunshine Coast based jobs in the food industry on the Jobs Hub from team leaders to logistics specialists, so I encourage job seekers to jump onto the site, sign up and see what opportunities are on offer.”

A diverse range of jobs and industries are available on the Sunshine Coast Jobs Hub.

Jobs currently up for grabs on the site include a strategic project coordinator at University of the Sunshine Coast ($100,000 salary), sous chef in Maleny ($70,000) and a labourer in Caloundra ($32 per hour), along with some very exciting opportunities at Australia Zoo for those keen on becoming elephant or tiger keepers.

Job Seekers can become a member of the Jobs Hub for free and enjoy multiple benefits including finding local jobs quickly and easily, receive local job alerts, create and/or upload their CV on the AirCV and keep up to date with further education and training opportunities.

An extension of the Sunshine Coast Jobs Hub is the [Sunshine Coast Student Jobs Hub,](https://www.scstudentjobs.com.au/)
&#x20;which connects students and graduates with industry and job opportunities on the Sunshine Coast.
