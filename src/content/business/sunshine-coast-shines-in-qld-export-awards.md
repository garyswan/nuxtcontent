Two Sunshine Coast companies, one a prime beef producer and distributor to 35 global markets and another which creates and services iconic aquariums across the world, are vying for top gong at this year’s state export awards.

Kilcoy Global Foods (KGF) and Kunda Park-based Advanced Aquarium Technologies (AAT) have been named finalists in the Premier of Queensland’s Export Awards 2021.

The local businesses joined 34 other companies across 13 categories which were chosen from 160 high-calibre applicants.  

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson congratulated both KGF and AAT on their achievements and said their export success highlighted the great business environment and opportunities that existed on the Sunshine Coast. 

“Exporting is one of the keys to future economic prosperity on the Sunshine Coast and our [Regional Economic Development Strategy](https://invest.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Economic-Strategy/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy)
&#x20;aims for 20 per cent of locally produced goods and services to be available for export by 2033,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“To help achieve this goal, council delivers a Local to Global program incorporating [export programs](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Export-Program)
&#x20;and networking events, access to exhibitions and missions and pathways to State and Federal contacts and programs.

“KGF and AAT are outstanding examples of the contemporary and innovative businesses that operate on the Sunshine Coast and have shown great resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”

KGF President Australian Division Jiah Falcke said despite the challenges of the last 12 months, the Sunshine Coast-based KGF team had developed innovative new products to strengthen the operation, along with growing its export markets for prime Queensland beef.

“From our headquarters at Birtinya, KGF manages the production, distribution, and export of eight million cartons of premium beef annually to more than 35 global markets,” Mr Falcke said.

“KGF is also a major supplier to Australian supermarkets, food wholesalers, fine dining establishments and popular family restaurants such as McDonalds.

“Between our corporate office at Birtinya and the Kilcoy processing plant, we employ more than 1600 people from 53 nationalities, and being judged a finalist in the export awards is a credit to their dedication and commitment.”

For almost 25 years, AAT has helped create and service some of the world’s most iconic and spectacular aquariums including Whitsunday Airport Heart Reef Aquarium, Proserpine, Cairns Aquarium, Daydream Island Resort and Living Reef, Whitsundays in Queensland, The Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne and MEGA Shopping and Leisure Centre Aquarium, Kaunas, Lithuania.

Winners in each of the 13 award categories go in the running to be named Queensland Exporter of the Year. They also gain automatic entry to the Australian Export & Investment Awards, held by Austrade in November.

The Premier of Queensland’s Export Awards 2021 will be held at City Hall in Brisbane on October 6.

Local hi-tech aerospace business Helimods took out the Premier of Queensland’s Award for Regional Exporter in 2019.
