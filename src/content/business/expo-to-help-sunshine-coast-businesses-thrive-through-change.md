Sunshine Coast business owners and operators should not miss this great opportunity to discover tips for managing your business through disruption.

Disruption can result from a range of influences such as COVID-19, severe weather events, cyber hacks or unplanned absences.

A first for the Sunshine Coast region, council is hosting a free Thriving Through Change Business Resilience Exhibition on Thursday October 28 at Sunshine Coast Convention Centre, Twin Waters.

The day will kick off with a breakfast event from 7am featuring keynote speaker, futurist, and digital strategist Chris Riddell, who will guide participants on ways to lead their business through challenges, and plan for a prosperous future. 

The Thriving Through Change exhibition will start at 10am and showcase speakers, information and resources covering topics such as financial planning, employment law, cyber security, sustainability and wellness.

The day will culminate with a business networking event hosted by Emcee Kim McCosker (4 Ingredients) and a keynote presentation by the Queensland Small Business Commissioner, Maree Adshead who will explore the importance of building stronger relationships, having a plan in place and calling on available resources.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the event would help to empower small business and promote a culture of preparedness and resilience. 

“Our local businesses are the backbone of our region’s economy and have shown amazing resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“There are more than 33,000 small businesses registered in our local government area, providing critical employment opportunities for our community. 

“We want to arm all of our businesses with the practical information they need, as well as provide the opportunity to ask questions of leading experts.

“Be sure to register and come along, if you want to learn more about how to recover quickly when a disruption comes along.”

The Thriving Through Change Business Resilience Exhibition will be held at the Wandiny Room, Sunshine Coast Convention Centre at Twin Waters and includes three components:

*   6.45am - 10am

    ['Leading through Change' Breakfast session](https://qld.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=014e7309c837919c9341867db&id=4adc7d2f81&e=9c02ed96e7)


    (booking required)

*   10am - 4pm 'Thriving through Change' Exhibition (no booking required)

*   4pm - 6pm

    ['Together through Change' Networking event](https://qld.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=014e7309c837919c9341867db&id=dbd4997673&e=9c02ed96e7)


    (booking required)

Businesses are welcome to attend one or all sessions. Registrations are required for the breakfast session and networking event. 

Business resilience is the capacity to change, grow and flourish following disruptions.

A disaster resilient region means our businesses, community services sector, government agencies, communities and the individual know the risks and hazards we individually and as a region face, how we should respond, and has the ability to return to ‘normal’ life or business as quickly as possible in the aftermath of such events.
