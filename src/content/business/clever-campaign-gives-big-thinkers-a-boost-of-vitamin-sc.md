It’s no secret we live in one of the most beautiful places on earth. From our beautiful hinterland, our stunning beaches and our parks and gardens, to our retail and dining offerings and our sporting, education and health facilities, we have a lifestyle envied by many.

Now, firmly established as one of Australia’s most tech-savvy regions, thanks to our new state-of-the-art city centre at Maroochydore, an international runway, and international submarine cable, the Sunshine Coast is a magnet for big thinkers and innovative business people.

And as more Australian city businesses look to the regions to establish, relocate or expand, council, through its Vitamin SC (Sunshine Coast) campaign, is placing Sunshine Coast in the spotlight, showcasing our attractive range of business benefits and lifestyle advantages.[](https://youtu.be/tfWHiTzEJT4)

Sunshine Coast Council Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the campaign was aimed at those out-of-town business leaders, encouraging them to consider the Sunshine Coast as a potential business location for some or all of their operations.

“By attracting these entrepreneurs to the Sunshine Coast, we are future proofing our region and ensuring our residents can grow up here, study locally and secure a prosperous career here,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Thanks to the region-shaping infrastructure projects delivered by council, state and federal governments and the commercial sector, the Sunshine Coast is offering just that opportunity.

“This is the smart place for businesses. We are opening up new and exciting employment opportunities including professional jobs our residents would otherwise need to relocate to, outside the Sunshine Coast.”

“The Vitamin SC video series highlights some of our very best entrepreneurs and the perks they enjoy by working here.

“Take for example, the entertaining story of inner-city manager Cam as he discovers the benefits to both himself and his business when he relocates to the Sunshine Coast.

“In line with our commitment to supporting locals, the videos were produced by council, with the help of talented Sunshine Coast creatives, producers and actors.”

Cr Landsberg said the Vitamin SC campaign was not designed to attract more people to our region rather, it aimed to attract new businesses which would provide new high-value employment opportunities.
