Study Sunshine Coast (SSC) celebrated the latest cohort of Project Global Citizen (PGC) scholars at a Graduation Ceremony held last week. 30 local Sunshine Coast students from USC and TAFE Queensland participated in the 8-week cross cultural intelligence program. It was a night of celebration honouring the hardwork and dedication of the students, with all graduates receiving a highly valued micro-credential at the Graduation ceremony.

Over the past three years SSC has funded over 120 Sunshine Coast students to complete the PGC program. Study Sunshine Coast Strategic Projects and Partnerships Director, Marina Murray said the program continues to go from strength to strength.

“We are extremely proud to have funded so many local students to participate and graduate from the cultural competency accelerator program over the past few years.  

“PGC offers a personal and professional development program focused on students developing their cultural intelligence for studying, living and working across cultures as global citizens. To see the positive impacts of the program on our students and also watching many of our PGC alumni go on to successful careers has been truly rewarding,” Murray said.

Head of International at USC, Alex Elibank-Murray has been delighted with the positive outcomes for students who have participated in the Project Global Citizen Program.

“The Project Global Citizen program has been such a great opportunity for USC students to develop and advance their cultural intelligence skills. Now more than ever, these skills are so important for our students to evolve and nurture as students and throughout their career,” Elibank-Murray said.

“Through this Study Sunshine Coast program, our students are learning invaluable skills and knowledge to help them succeed no matter where in the world they wish to work. We are so proud to offer this program here on the Sunshine Coast to our students.”

At the Graduation ceremony, Study Sunshine Coast announced they will be running a Semester 2, Project Global Citizen Program, kicking off on Tuesday 16th August with a three hour workshop. “We look forward to having a strong representative of local student talent in this program,” Murray said.

Applications are now open for full subsidised scholarships into the Semester 2, Project Global Citizen Program. These scholarships are always highly sought after, so we encourage interested students to apply soon.
