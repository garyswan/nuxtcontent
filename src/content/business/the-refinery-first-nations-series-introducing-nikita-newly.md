Nikita Newly from [New Dreaming Art](https://www.newdreamingart.com/)
&#x20;is the amazing artist behind this year’s brand for the inaugural [Refinery First Nations Series](https://oursc.com.au/council-news/first-nations-mentors-to-support-creative-business)
.

Nikita shares some of the challenges she's encountered with her creative business?

### **How long have you lived on the coast?**

On and off since I was 2 years old.

### **Do you have a base for your arts practice?**

I currently have a residency at the [Lantana Art Space](https://www.lantanaspace.com/)
, Moffat Beach I’m there three days a week if it flows. 

### **What are some of the biggest challenges you have encountered with your creative business?**

Balancing family life and career goals! Also probably getting paid my asking price for my work and knowledge.

### **What type of artist are you?**

Best way to describe my style is unpredictable and intuitive with a cultural perspective and abstract twist.

### **How long have you been working on your practice?**

Full time now since 2019, before that I never showed my art to the public.

### **If you had to describe your work in one sentence, what would you say?**

A wave of emotions and storytelling.

### **Where can people find out more or follow you?**

New Dreaming Art - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/new_dreaming_art/)
&#x20;and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/artbykeets/)
. Also head over to my website [www.newdreamingart.com](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Ki2mC5QPMjIM8poKtOWCvA?domain=newdreamingart.com)
.

### **Can you describe the inspiration/story behind your artwork “Walking a Generation”**

My family and friends we all walk different paths but some how we all connect with each other one way or another. We need to listen to the older generations and the younger generations in order to understand and move forward. So while we are walking we are learning.

### **Have you had any 'wins' with your creative business?**

I was selected as the artist for the new campaign for Hepatitis Queensland. My art will be released in March 23 all over Queensland and health sectors. 

I was honoured to be nominated for a [creative business award](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Awards-and-Citizenship/Australia-Day-Awards/Australia-Day-Award-Nominees-2023)
&#x20;from the Sunshine Coast community.

Through Creative Arts, I participated in an artist residency with 20 First Nations artists in SEQ at Woodfordia on Jinibara County.  

Showcasing my art in a number of local art exhibitions on the Sunshine Coast, and selling all pieces.
