They were the first inventors, first scientists, first builders, first agriculturalists, first navigators and first healers – and Australia’s First Nations people are blazing new trails in business.

A craft beer made with all-Australian ingredients, a tourism experience to inspire deeper connections to First Nations culture and a driving education school for First Nations youth were just some of the local products and services on show at the recent First Nations Supplier Day at Nambour Showgrounds.

Founder and owner of Saltwater Eco Tours Simon Thornalley said the council-supported event was a great platform for First Nations suppliers to collaborate and grow. 

“This is such a good event for the community to come together and showcase what we have and what we can offer here,” Mr Thornalley said.

“I’m hoping to connect with every business here and see how we can collaborate. If we can collaborate with every supplier we have, with another local Indigenous business, then the ripple effect of that will be massive and that’s what we’re all about.

“Within our boat on our tours, we do five courses of native foods and almost every component of that is locally sourced and Indigenous owned.

“There’s a great amount of local suppliers now which is absolutely incredible, so we can get seasonal native food, we can get products that are already pre-made, it’s easily accessible.”

More than 35 First Nations businesses attended this week’s event, including a new locally based beer brand, employment and recruitment businesses, healthcare providers, film and production, driver education, arts and native foods.       

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the event was a great opportunity to showcase and strengthen First Nations businesses.

“This is the second year the First Nations Supplier Day has been held and one of the big aims of this event is to provide a platform for local First Nations businesses and what they deliver to the economic fabric of the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Law said.         

“By strengthening connections between First Nations suppliers, government agencies and non-government organisations, this event provided an opportunity for First Nations businesses to become a supplier of choice for a wide range of products and services.”

Council received a regional grant of $7500 from the Queensland Government to host the event during Indigenous Business Month.

The First Nations Supplier Day was proudly sponsored by Sunshine Coast Council, Queensland Department of Employment, Small Business & Training, Queensland Department of Seniors , Disability Services and Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Woolworths, PwC’s Indigenous Consulting, The BlackCard, North Coast Aboriginal Corporation for Community health.
