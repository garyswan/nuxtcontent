Would you like to be part of building a flourishing arts ecology in the region?

Council is conducting an audit of the local arts sector and we need your help.

The information we gather will assist Council to plan and prioritise programming and funding for the arts. It also helps us to advocate for services and support and ensure that polices reflect the concerns of the creative arts sector.

The last audit was undertaken in 2017 and was used to inform the development of the Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018 – 2038. At the time council committed to conducting the survey every five years to guide the review of the Plan and ensure it is still on track to effectively meet its vision - ‘*The soul of our community is our flourishing arts ecology: nurturing connections, promoting experimentation and inspiring collaboration*.' 

By taking five minutes to complete the Creative Arts Audit Survey, you will be helping to build our flourishing arts ecology into the future.

*Survey closes at midnight on Friday 24 June 2022.*
