A new accelerator program has been unveiled supporting home-grown entrepreneurs working on innovative and tech-based solutions to address global health challenges.

The SunRamp Health Technology Accelerator Program is a 12-week program that will provide education, training and support to accelerate health technology businesses.

It will empower companies to secure new deals, build revenue and scale the business in national and international markets.

Expressions of interest are invited from those working on digital solutions to improve and transform the health sector. This could include health-based smart devices, wearables and technology, mental health apps, e-treatment, technological improvements to health industry processes and more.

The program is jointly supported by the Queensland Government’s Advance Queensland and Sunshine Coast Council.

Innovation Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said the new accelerator program had potential to be a significant contributor to Queensland’s future economy.

“Projects like this are important for boosting Queensland’s strong and growing credentials in healthtech innovation,” Mr Hinchliffe said.

“The Palaszczuk Government has invested $180,000 in Advance Queensland funding and sees the healthtech accelerator as an investment in the Sunshine Coast’s economic recovery, already underway.

“SunRamp’s record for success in the United States is a terrific boost for innovation on the Sunshine Coast.”

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Sunshine Coast based program would leverage the Sunshine Coast International Broadband Network and attract, accelerate, and grow Queensland businesses to provide digital and technological solutions to improve health and wellbeing outcomes and deliver economic value for our region.

“At a time when we are encouraging opportunities to support the resurgence of our local economy, we are very pleased to see this program delivered in our region and provide opportunities for our local businesses,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It is a great fit for the Sunshine Coast.

“The SunRamp Health Technology Accelerator Program supports the implementation of the Regional Economic Development Strategy which aims to attract and support accelerators and programs to foster innovation in our high-value industries – of which health and wellbeing is a leader - and continue to grow our region's innovation ecosystem.”

SunRamp is led by a strong team with extensive experience and knowledge.

No stranger to digital innovation, having initiated a number of start-ups in the USA, Founder and Executive Director Ron Hill said he was excited to bring such a well-supported and connected accelerator program to the Sunshine Coast to be part of the fantastic vision Sunshine Coast Council has for the region.

“We’ll be looking for up to six healthtech companies per cohort to join the 12-week program on the Sunshine Coast,” Mr Hill said.

Colin Graham, inaugural CEO of the Innovation Centre Sunshine Coast, has joined the SunRamp team as Program Manager and said the region experienced huge health industry growth in the last five years on the back of the development of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and the establishment of the USC’s Thompson Institute. 

“There are real opportunities to grow more world class healthtech businesses in the region,” Mr Graham said.

The core team is completed with the addition of Tanya Arnold, who contributed to the growth of the Food and Agribusiness Network on the Sunshine Coast.

The first program will run from 8 June until 31 August and include a series of six specialist workshops, one-on-one coaching and networking opportunities.
