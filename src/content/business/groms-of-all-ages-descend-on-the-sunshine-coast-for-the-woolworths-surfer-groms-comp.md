Groms of all ages will battle it out on the Sunshine Coast (Coolum Beach) this weekend at Event 10 of the Woolworths Surfer Groms Comp presented by Ruffie. The comp is designed to deliver a fun and friendly introduction to surf competition for micro groms.

Event 10 is the final event of the nationwide series before the National Final which will be held Sunday 18 December. 

The grommets will be giving it their best efforts for the final chance of qualifying, from under 8 mixed parent-assist through to the under 14 Boys and Girls divisions.  

The event encourages a fun day at the beach but also aims to push the grom's competitive side with the respective winners of the Under 14 boys’ and girls’ divisions from each event receiving an invite to attend an all-expenses-paid, three-day Woolworths Surfer Grom Comps National Final Surf Camp at the Surfing Australia High-Performance Centre (HPC).

Surfing Queensland Event Manager, Elliot Dempster, said the Woolworths Surfer Groms Comp is a great introduction to competitive surfing for Queensland's up-and-coming surfers. 

"The Woolworths Surfer Groms Comp is a fantastic series for our young surfers," said Dempster. 

"The last event in the series is always exciting, as the kids know it's their last chance to qualify for the National Finals. We're pumped to be hosting it and to watch them showcase their talent."

The event is scheduled to begin at 7:30am on Saturday 10 December on the Sunshine Coast. Please call the Surfing Queensland event hotline (07 3030 6388) each morning for the confirmed location.
