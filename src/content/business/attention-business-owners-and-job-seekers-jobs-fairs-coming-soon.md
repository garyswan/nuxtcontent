The Australian Government and Sunshine Coast Council are hosting two Jobs Fairs in the region to help employers on the Sunshine Coast find the staff they are looking for.

Exhibiting at the Sunshine Coast Jobs Fairs is free and provides the perfect opportunity for employers to showcase their current and upcoming job vacancies to enthusiastic job seekers, with a variety of skills, face-to-face.

It is also a chance to increase your candidate pool.

If you have vacancies to fill, register for free to exhibit at the Sunshine Coast Jobs Fairs.

The Sunshine Coast Jobs Fairs will be held over two days.

The first will be in Caloundra on Wednesday November 3 2021 from 9.30am to 3.30pm at The Events Centre, 20 Minchinton St, Caloundra.

The second will be in Mountain Creek on Friday November 5 2021 from 9.30am to 3.30pm at TAFE Queensland Mooloolaba Campus, 34 Lady Musgrave Drive, Mountain Creek.
