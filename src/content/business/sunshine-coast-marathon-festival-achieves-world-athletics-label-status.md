The Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival, one of Australia's fastest growing running festivals, has been awarded the prestigious ‘World Athletics Label Status’ by World Athletics in 2023.

The festival will also be hosting the ‘Australian Half Marathon Road Championships’, making it a must-visit destination for runners globally looking to set new personal bests in the half-marathon distance.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Cr Jason O’Pray said, “it was marvellous to see the Sunshine Coast on the list amongst Madrid, Singapore, Boston, Dublin, London and Tokyo to name just a few other places with this special label.

"And to be one of only three Australian events to receive the label shows Atlas Events continues to deliver a world class event on our beautiful Sunshine Coast, a great attraction for elite athletes from all over the world to experience.”

The Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival, organised by Atlas Events, has experienced exponential growth in recent years, becoming one of the most anticipated running events in the country.

With its picturesque coastal course and temperate running conditions in the month of August, the Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival has attracted participants from all over the world who are eager to challenge themselves and experience the excitement of a world-class marathon event in one of Australia’s most desirable destinations.

The recent achievement of ‘World Athletics Label Status’ is a testament to the event's commitment to excellence in organisation, course design, and participant experience. It places the Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival among the elite ranks of international marathons, with only a handful of races in Australia attaining this distinction.

This recognition further solidifies the event's reputation as a premier destination for runners seeking a high-quality race experience.

In addition to the ‘World Athletics Label Status’, the Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival will also be hosting the ‘Australian Half Marathon Road Championships’, adding another layer of excitement and competitiveness to the event.

Elite runners, as well as recreational runners, will have the opportunity to test their skills against the best in the country on the festival's fast and flat course, which has become known as Australia's PB playground in the half marathon distance.

"Our event has seen remarkable growth over the years, and we are committed to providing an exceptional experience for every participant, whether they are chasing a personal best or simply enjoying the camaraderie of fellow runners.

"The combination of our fast and scenic course, world-class organisation, and the opportunity to compete in the Australian Championships makes the Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival an event not to be missed for any runner."

#### **The Sunshine Coast Marathon Festival is scheduled to take place on 12-13 of August in 2023, and registration for the event is now open.**
