The Brisbane Road, Walan and Hancock streets intersection is now flowing nicely since reopening last month, as major roadworks continue to forge ahead to expand Brisbane Road to four lanes.

Extensive underground services works, including mains water, sewer, stormwater and telecommunications, have been undertaken at the intersection since late April.

**Watch the video to find out what’s below the surface.**

*Video taken early October.*

In the next few months, the new Foote Street, Brisbane Road and Tarcoola Avenue signalised intersection will experience similar underground infrastructure.

To keep two-way traffic moving along Foote Street, the central island carparking, between Brisbane Road and Burnett Street, will be temporarily removed for about two months.

Tarcoola Ave as of early October.

## **SWITCHING IT UP**

With construction of the two new western lanes complete, traffic will soon be ‘switched’ to the new lanes between Tarcoola Avenue/Foote Street and the Mayes Canal Bridge (one lane each way).

This will enable the two new eastern side lanes to be constructed.

Constructing the lanes two at a time enables motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to continue to use Brisbane Road.

The opening of all four lanes is expected by the end of this year (weather and site conditions permitting). After the roadworks are complete landscaping will take place.

Council will continue to make every effort to minimise impacts to the local community and businesses during construction and thanks the community for their patience during this major construction project.

This project is improving connectivity and travel choices in the heart of Mooloolaba and will benefit pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and public transport users.

For more information about the project, visit the project webpage at [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/MTCU](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/MTCU)
 or to register for construction updates, email your details to mtcu\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.
