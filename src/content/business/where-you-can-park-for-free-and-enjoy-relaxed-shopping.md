Shoppers are being encouraged to buy local this Christmas, with the help of Council’s free on-street parking in one of the Sunshine Coast’s most picturesque CBDs.

The Caloundra parking amnesty will run through to Monday, January 9, 2023. The on-street parking meters will be switched off, however, signed time limits will still apply.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said free on-street parking was a great way to bring visitors and locals into the CBD and encourage them to shop local this festive season.

“I encourage people to take advantage of the free parking and support businesses in downtown Caloundra.

“The free parking will run for three weeks to cover the main holiday period and make shopping and dining in this wonderful part of the Coast even more relaxed,” Cr Landsberg said.

“There’s also free multi-storey parking available at Ormuz Avenue Car Park and the Transit Centre where visitors can stroll through to look at the vibrant street art and laneway businesses.”

Funds raised by Caloundra’s parking meters throughout the year are used for a range of projects in downtown Caloundra, including CBD activation, public facilities and business support programs.

Parking officers will continue patrolling the area to address compliance with parking time limit regulations, and ensure parking availability is optimised during the holidays.

On and off street [parking](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Parking/Parking-Regulations)
 is available at various locations throughout Caloundra.
