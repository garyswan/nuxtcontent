Sods were recently turned today for a brand new hotel in the new Maroochydore CBD.

Owned by global investment firm Pro-invest Group, the nine-storey hotel on First Avenue will feature 181 rooms, a rooftop swimming pool, bar and dining venue, conference and function facilities, parking and ground-level retail space.

Set to open in May 2022, the hotel will be a great boost for local jobs during construction and ongoing when the hotel is operational.
