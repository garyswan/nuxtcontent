More than 800 jobs were on offer at the Australian Government’s Caloundra Jobs Fair today (3 November), with Sunshine Coast employers setting up shop to connect with job seekers from across the region.

If you missed out, make sure you attend the second Sunshine Coast Jobs Fair which will be held this Friday, 5 November, at the TAFE Mooloolaba campus in Mountain Creek.

Jobs Fairs are an Australian Government initiative being held around Australia. More than 54,000 people have attended 44 jobs fairs since they began in July 2018.

The two Sunshine Coast Jobs Fairs are being delivered by the Australian Government in partnership with the Sunshine Coast Council and aim to bring together local job seekers, employers, and employment service providers.

Job seekers can chat directly with employers and discuss current job opportunities and career options from a wide range of industries on the Sunshine Coast. The workshops are designed to help job seekers get job ready and secure their next role.

Job seekers can also book a free one-on-one session at the fairs to have their résumé reviewed or have some interview practise with an experienced consultant.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson took the opportunity to visit the Caloundra fair which included local employers Youi Insurance, White’s IGA, Kilcoy Global Foods and Suncare hoping to find employees to join their teams.

“The jobs fairs offer something valuable for everyone and I strongly encourage job seekers to register and attend Friday’s (November 5) fair at TAFE Mooloolaba where almost 50 employers will be exhibiting,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“There are more than 33,000 registered businesses in our local government area, which rely on our local workforce to keep their businesses operating.

“One thing that our council is consistently hearing from many local businesses that they need more staff to ensure they can continue to grow following the impacts of COVID-19.

“The jobs fairs help to provide our region with the talent and skills to drive our economy forward and are a key action as part of the Sunshine Coast Regional Economic Development Strategy (REDS).”

Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, said the jobs fairs promoted a wide range of employment opportunities for job seekers looking to get into work.

“The Australian Government is committed to connecting job seekers with businesses looking to hire, as we continue our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Minister Robert said.

“Creating jobs and boosting the skills of Australians to help them get back into work is at the heart of our Economic Recovery Plan.

“Continuing the strong momentum, we’ve seen in the local labour market, we want as many people from the Sunshine Coast and surrounding areas as possible to upskill and reskill and get work in their communities.”

Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services, the Hon Luke Howarth MP, said the Caloundra jobs fair was part of series of jobs fairs funded by the Morrison Government’s jobactive Program.

“Certain sectors of the economy are experiencing a strong demand for workers, and the Sunshine Coast and South-East Queensland are no exception,” Assistant Minister Howarth said.

“We know there is a real need to fill vacancies across the Australian labour market, which is why the Sunshine Coast jobs fairs are so important.”

Andrew Wallace, the Federal Member for Fisher, said the Morrison Government’s ongoing commitment to creating more jobs will set the Sunshine Coast up for future prosperity as the place to be for employment, education and retirement.

“Our plan to connect local job seekers with work will help the Sunshine Coast bounce back stronger than ever after the COVID-19 pandemic. These jobs fairs in Mooloolaba and Caloundra have jobs, apprenticeships and traineeships on offer from employers in a wide range of sectors like IFYS, and Home Care Assistance,” Mr Wallace said.

“Whether you a Sunshine Coast resident who is looking for work, or you are aiming to upskill and begin a new career in one of our emerging sectors of the future, I’d encourage you to come along to Mooloolaba and find out more about the fantastic opportunities available right here in our region,” he said.

Two sessions will be held at the jobs fair. Session 1 will run from 9.30am to noon. Session 2 will run from 1pm to 3.30pm.

Free shuttle buses will be available from Coolum Surf Club, Sunshine Plaza and Kawana Shopping World bus stops – look out for the jobs fair shuttle bus signs. Bookings are not required for the shuttle bus.
