Local First Nations businesses are invited to be part of a showcase featuring their products and contributions to our Sunshine Coast.

Council’s First Nations Supplier Day will be the first of its kind in the region held next month (November 15) at Beachtree Distilling Co. where the community will be encouraged to attend, network and show their support to First Nations businesses.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the event provided a great opportunity to scaffold relationships between the local community and First Nations suppliers.

“By reinforcing the bond between First Nations suppliers, government agencies and non-government organisations, the First Nations Supplier Day aims to support a strong and resilient community which prioritises local First Nations businesses as the suppliers of choice,” Cr Law said.  

“This also allows us to nurture relationships and promote council’s role in the region while delivering on council’s Reconciliation Action Plan.

“We would love to see many First Nations businesses jump on board this excellent free opportunity, as it was First Nations people who were the first builders and engineers, the first inventors and scientists.”

Beachtree Distilling Co. Manager Kirra Daley said hosting the First Nations Supplier event was an opportunity to bring the community together.

“It will give other First Nations businesses a place to come together and yarn about who they are and celebrate their journey so far,” Ms Daley said.

“Events like the Supplier Day create opportunities for community support, brand awareness, establishing relationships and is an opportunity to share your journey with potential clients and vendors. It is exciting to think about the collaborations that can also come from events like these that bring the First Nations community together.”

Beachtree Distilling Co. Head Distiller Steve Grace said their company was a new organic distillery located on the Sunshine Coast.

“We offer gluten-free, pure artisan gins and vodka that highlights the use of native botanicals,” Mr Grace said.

First Nations businesses (where more than 51 per cent of the business is owned and operated by First Nations people) can express their interest in hosting a stall by phoning (07) 5441 8629 or emailing firstnations\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au by 8 November 2021.

Council’s First Nations Supplier Day will be held at Beachtree Distilling Co. 14 Industrial Ave, Caloundra West, on Monday 15 November from 3-8pm. Free entry.
