[GreaseBoss](https://greaseboss.com.au/)
, an Australian start-up founded in 2020 on the Sunshine Coast, is going for gold in the global award program dubbed the Innovation World Cup Series.

Co-CEO Tim Hall said the team at GreaseBoss was thrilled to be part of the 2022 Hannover Messe and announced as finalists.

“To be nominated in the Industrial IoT category and make it through to the top 3% and listed in the Top 15 Innovators for 2022 is really huge for us,” Mr Hall said.

“It will really open up the doors in the European market for us and we are 100% ready for that.”

At a tour of the GreaseBoss facility in Birtinya earlier today (May 24), Sunshine Coast Council Councillor Peter Cox congratulated Co-CEO Tim Hall on being a finalist and wished the team well before they set-off to Hannover, Germany on Thursday night (May 26).

“Sunshine Coast Council supports GreaseBoss through its Economic Development arm with industry development advice and connections,” Councillor Cox said.

“Thanks to our connection with this outstanding local company and its executives travelling to Europe, the Invest Sunshine Coast’s Investment Prospectus will be promoted to other world class innovators.”

Three mining industry engineers launched the company after developing a novel system to automate the lubrication of heavy equipment and avoid the costly hassle of breakdowns.

GreaseBoss is a simple lubrication management system which prevents equipment failure and reduces maintenance costs.

The product, which has recently undergone further redesign for increased simplicity and durability, is now deployed at about 15 sites, including wastewater plants and power stations.

GreaseBoss is a globally scalable technology solution to a problem experienced by all industrial operations.

It is in use in South Africa and GreaseBoss hopes to soon push into North and South America.

The vision for GreaseBoss is to ensure every grease point receives the right grease at the right time in the right quantity, effectively eliminating lubrication failure.

GreaseBoss is backed by notable investors including legendary US Quarterback Joe Montana (Liquid2Ventures) and Brent Watt’s 77 Partners.

Joe Montana is expected to help GreaseBoss enter the US market in the second half of 2022.

The winners of the 2022 Hanover Messe Innovation World Cup Series will be announced June 1.

The Innovation World Cup® Series is the world’s leading tech open innovation platform and has supported breakthrough techpreneurs and their innovations since 2003. At Hannover Messe, it will honour the Top 15 IoT Innovators 2022.
