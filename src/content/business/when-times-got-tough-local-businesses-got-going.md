As the Sunshine Coast business community continues to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, stories of triumph, tenacity and community spirit are emerging.

From building an online nursery to opening a brewery, and launching a nationwide in-home hospital platform, there are countless businesses that are achieving great results and helping our region to not only recover, but thrive.

To acknowledge these businesses, Sunshine Coast Council and Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance have teamed up to showcase Local Business Champions – an inspirational campaign to shine a light on local businesses delivering great services, products or doing something amazing in our community.

Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the Local Business Champions series was developed in collaboration with the Economic Resurgence Taskforce to inspire confidence in business and industry, and win back consumer trust and confidence, a key theme of the region’s Economic Resurgence Plan.

The role of the Sunshine Coast Economic Resurgence Taskforce is to provide advice and guidance to Council on how to deliver the highest value results in the shortest timeframe in light of COVID-19. The Taskforce is made up of local business leaders and co-chaired by Economic Development Portfolio Councillors Jason O’Pray and Terry Landsberg.

“The latest Chamber of Commerce & Industry Queensland \*[Pulse Survey](https://www.cciq.com.au/business-voice/pulse/)
&#x20;indicated an improvement for businesses on the Sunshine Coast, where optimism is performing considerably better than the statewide average.

“I’d like to thank our local businesses for being resilient and agile when faced with these unprecedented events. I’d also like to thank our community for supporting our local businesses when they needed it most,” Cr Landsberg said.

“To celebrate the remarkable achievements of our business community, council is working with the Chamber Alliance to seek out and promote these great local stories.”

“I encourage the entire community to get behind our Local Business Champions and share their stories far and wide.

“If we all post a photo or short video of a Sunshine Coast local business via social media and use the hashtag #localbusinesschampions we can help create awareness and positivity for our business community.”

Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance Chairperson Wallis Westbrook said this was a great opportunity for everyone in our community to celebrate the diverse and vibrant businesses we have on the Coast.

“There are more than 30,000 businesses based in our region and every one of them provides opportunity, investment, and employment,” Mr Westbrook said.

“The Local Business Champions campaign gives us all a chance to recognise those we rely on and see working so hard to deliver their wonderful products and services to our region.”

One of the first to be acknowledged as a Local Business Champion is Adam Tomlinson of Stalwart Brewing Company in Nambour.

Adam moved to the Sunshine Coast at the start of 2020 to see his dream of opening a craft beer brewery come to fruition.

“I was so excited to move in here at the start of 2020, but then COVID came, so I was left with a pub with no beer,” Adam said.

Adam persevered and overcame many challenges to open his brew pub in Nambour on July 18.

“A local business champion is someone you admire, someone you look up to, someone who helps make the community a better place,” Adam said.

Other #localbusinesschampions have included Kenilworth Dairies, Cedar Hill Corporate Group, Zone RV, ENTAG, Black Cat Civil and Saltwater Eco Tours to name a few.
