A new attractive streetscape will soon transform the tired older section of First Avenue, Maroochydore, into a vibrant, shady and inclusive link between the Maroochydore City Centre (CBD), Cotton Tree and Ocean Street precincts. 

The upgrade will provide businesses, residents and visitors a more inviting space to live, work and play.

The major streetscape upgrade is ready for construction later this year and is being delivered as part of the Streetscape Capital Works Program.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the $10 million First Avenue upgrade, in partnership with the Queensland Government, was a critical step in connecting the newly expanded CBD with the other business and recreation precincts.

“The streetscape design will link this section of First Avenue with the new First Avenue extension into the CBD, Aerodrome Road, The Esplanade and Duporth Avenue,” Cr Cox said.  

“The upgrade is all about improving the built urban environment with shaded and attractive open space to conduct business, enjoy the local restaurants and actively move about more safely and efficiently.

“The design also creates street atmosphere and significantly enhances the look and experience of the area to help maintain and build upon Maroochydore’s already strong economy and become a catalyst for attracting new investment.

“The design incorporates elements to calm local traffic to significantly improve shared space and safety for pedestrians and cyclists.

“The concept design was discussed with traders and building owners in 2018, raising a variety of key values which have since been incorporated into the final design.

“If you’ve taken a drive around the new CBD recently, you would have seen it’s a hive of activity with new construction and business bustle.

“This momentum will continue as we expand and further enhance our surrounding streets to offer our community an emerging city centre to support our growing region.”

The streetscape design creates an urban forest connection that will cool, shade and green the link and offers more space for potential outdoor dining and night-time trade.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the green boost included approximately 60 new trees and 1500 new plants in the landscaping.

“Green areas have a positive effect on our wellbeing and makes the area a people-friendly CBD,” Cr Natoli said.

“Surrounding the trees will be a variety of street furniture, wide footpaths, shared spaces and improved crossings and connections to existing and future pedestrian and cycling pathways.

“The upgrade also includes raised pedestrian crossings along First Avenue, Cornmeal Parade, Memorial Avenue and George Street, and a scramble crossing (similar to those used in the Brisbane CBD) at the intersection of First Avenue, Duporth Avenue and The Esplanade in order to calm traffic and keep our nearest and dearest safe.

“Improving connectivity allows council to ensure our new and existing footpaths are accessible for all abilities, families with prams, toddlers in tow, the elderly with walkers, people using mobility aids and anyone with wheels on the ground.  

“I’m really looking forward to this upgrade and thank new businesses and residents for their support and understanding.

“This design has been detailed since council’s initial engagement of the concept design.  

“Which is why I’m encouraging the community and traders to come along to our Design Information night being held 27 July, followed by our Construction Information night in August 2022, to better understand the construction process – there will be more details closer to the date on council’s website.”

**FAST FACTS:**

**Council’s First Ave, Maroochydore, includes:**

*   Improving safety through a slower speed environment and improving pedestrian connectivity through raised pedestrian and scramble crossings. A scramble crossing allows pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
*   Upgrading footpath level variations and driveways to be accessible for all.
*   Transforming the eastern side of First Avenue with extended kerbing, landscaped areas and new street furniture.
*   Transforming the western side of First Avenue into a six-metre-wide, shared path for pedestrians and cyclists with a centralised green strip.
*   Relocating the two bus stops along First Avenue to The Esplanade and upgrading them to minimise conflict with other First Avenue Street users.
*   Extensive landscaping with approximately 60 new trees and 1500 new plantings.
*   Changes to on-street parking on the western side of First Avenue will be made to accommodate the shared path for pedestrians and bicycles. These changes have been offset with parking in Cornmeal Parade car park.
*   Retaining but redistributing on-street parking on the eastern side of First Avenue.
*   Streetscape construction works are expected to start late-2022.
