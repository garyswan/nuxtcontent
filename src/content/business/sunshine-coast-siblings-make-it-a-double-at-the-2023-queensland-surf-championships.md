Sunshine Coast siblings, Giorgia Lorentson and Ben Lorentson, made it a family affair at the Queensland State Champions (QSC) in the Open Women and Men Shortboard divisions.

The brother and sister duo, both previous State Champions, put on spectacular performance's in three-to-four foot punchy conditions at Alexandra Headland on Saturday 22 April, 2023.

The blue-ribbon divisions lived up to their expectations, with surfers putting on an excellent display of surfing, laying it all on the line for the top spot.

As an added bonus, the winners received an automatic position in the Australian Open of Surfing (AOS) Grand Final which will be held later this year, as well as the QLD Title. 

2021 Open Women's Shortboard champion, Giorgia Lorentson, said she's over the moon to be crowned the Open Women's Queensland Champion today and secure a position at the AOS Grand Final to be held in Bondi Beach later this year. 

"I was pretty exhausted after a long day of surfing," said Lorentson. "I'm so happy to win today in really fun waves and get my title back as the Open Women's State Champion. It's extra special to have won with my brother."

2022 QSC Open Mens Champion, Ben Lorentson, looked unstoppable, and was able to defend his Title against fellow Sunshine Coast surfers. 

Lorentson said he was thrilled to win today and is excited to throw his hat in the ring at the AOS Grand Final. 

"So stoked to get the win again this year," said Lorentson. "Seeing Gia win definitely made me super pumped going into the final. I managed to get a few good ones at the start and was lucky that was enough to take it out."

The Queensland Team has now been decided for each discipline including, Longboard, Logger, Masters Shortboard and Open Shortboard.
