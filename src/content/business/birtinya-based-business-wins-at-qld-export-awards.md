Sunshine Coast business Kilcoy Global Foods (KGF) was recognised as an outstanding export success story at the 2021 Premier of Queensland’s Export Awards in Brisbane on Wednesday night (6 October), in the Agribusiness, Food and Beverages Category.

From their headquarters at Birtinya, KGF manages the production, distribution, and export of eight million cartons of premium beef annually to more than 35 global markets. KGF is also a major supplier to Australian supermarkets, food wholesalers, fine dining establishments and family restaurants including McDonalds.

The local business joined 34 other leading exporters from across the state on Wednesday evening to celebrate the products and services Queensland is sharing across the globe.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson congratulated KGF on their achievements and noted their resilience and tenacity to overcome the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Kilcoy Global Foods is an outstanding example of an innovative business that chose to base its headquarters on the Sunshine Coast and sell to the world,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Their export success highlights the great business environment and opportunities that exist on the Sunshine Coast. 

“Exporting is one of the keys to future economic resilience on the Sunshine Coast and our [Regional Economic Development Strategy](https://invest.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Economic-Strategy/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy)
&#x20;aims for 20 per cent of locally produced goods and services to be produced for export by 2033.”

KGF President Australian Division Jiah Falcke said he was pleased his company’s export achievements have been recognised, particularly as the South East Queensland based company continues to grow its market share despite the challenges of the last 18 months.

“Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve still managed to grow our export base beyond our traditional key markets of South Korea, Japan and the USA to secure emerging markets such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan,” Mr Falcke said.

“Between Birtinya and Kilcoy where the processing plant is located, we employ around 1600+ people from 53 nationalities, and winning this export award is a credit to the dedication and commitment of our staff and the culture we have created.”

&#x20;(AAT) was also a finalist at the event. AAT was established in 1996, thanks to the vision and dedication of John Langmead, a diver and then senior manager at a commercial aquarium. 

The Premier of Queensland’s Export Awards are coordinated by the Export Council of Australia on behalf of Trade and Investment Queensland. The annual event acknowledges businesses in Queensland engaged in international trade and recognises their innovation, passion, and achievements.

KGF will go on to represent Queensland at the National Awards to be held in Canberra on November 27.
