Sunshine Coast creatives will benefit from the experience and passion of multi-talented dynamo Clare Bowditch, at an event held to be held on Friday 14 May at Maroochydore, as part of Council’s The Refinery creative arts incubator program.

Clare Bowditch is an international artist, actor, entrepreneur, best-selling author and the founder of [Big Hearted Business](http://www.bigheartedbusiness.com.au)
, a website and micro-movement, supporting people to make a living doing what they love.

She is also a mentor and special guest as part of this year’s [Refinery](https://www.therefinerysunshinecoast.com/)
&#x20;program, which supports entrepreneurs to transform creative ideas into sustainable businesses.

The event, ‘Clare Bowditch in conversation with Andrea Kirwin’  takes a look at Ms Bowditch’s vision and journey from musician to author to inspirational speaker at the MET, Maroochydore.

This event is open to everyone and is the first of three public events as part of the annual Refinery program which aims to nurture and connect Sunshine Coast’s creative community.

Ms Bowditch said the event was a great opportunity to channel her passion for music and sustainable arts business.

“I’ll be speaking about the importance of creative mentors, business with heart, the challenges and loves of a creative life and finding your own voice,” Ms Bowditch said.

Andrea Kirwin joins the conversation with tales from her own experiences, including her newly launched ‘Peace Run Records’ studio and venue in Nambour.

Ms Bowditch and Ms Kirwin will each perform during the event, which has a limited ticket capacity. Tickets are $35 and are available at [www.eventbrite.com.au](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/in-conversation-with-clare-bowditch-and-andrea-kirwin-tickets-151424224933?aff=ebdssbeac)


Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said The Refinery was an initiative of the Sunshine Coast Council in partnership with SunCentral & the MET, Sunshine Coast Creative Alliance and sponsored by Innovative Planning Solutions.

“From 6 May, 15 Sunshine Coast creatives will embark on the [2021 program](https://www.therefinerysunshinecoast.com/)
, which might start with an idea, but very much ends with a refined pitch and a creative business ready for market,” Cr Baberowski said.

“We’re excited to see a broad range of creative practice in the mix this year from theatre, illustration, photography, music, film and community practice.”

The Refinery delivers a number of industry events from now until July, including an industry panel around purpose, story and brand on June 10 and the final showcase of this year’s Refinery 3.0 cohort on July 2 - all hosted at The MET, in the Maroochydore City Centre.

The Refinery 3.0 journey starts Friday 7 May.Find out about this year’s participants at <https://www.therefinerysunshinecoast.com/>
