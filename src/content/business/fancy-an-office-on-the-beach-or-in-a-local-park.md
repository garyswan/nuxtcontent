If feeling the sand between your toes or the grass under foot while you work sounds like your dream job, now is the time to apply for a Sunshine Coast Council permit, with lots of opportunities available across the region.

The three-year high-use / high-impact permits are available for a range of businesses such as surfing and kite surfing schools, jet ski or boat hire, stand up paddle boarding, skydiving, refreshment vans and mobile dog washing.

At the November Ordinary meeting (November 10), council endorsed 29 locations where high-use / high-impact permits would be available.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said the permits would be awarded for activities that benefited the community.

“Public land is primarily for community use and enjoyment and these permits enable businesses to provide services to the community, while also ensuring a balance between the community’s use of public land, small businesses wanting to use the land and the needs of existing and well-established businesses in the area,” Cr Johnston said.

Applications for new or existing businesses will open on November 15. Permits will be valid from July 1, 2022 until June 30, 2025.

Existing permit holders have been advised of the application period.

Information about permit requirements, locations, types of activities, associated fees and the assessment process is available on council’s website or by emailing landpermits\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

Applications close on December 12, 2021.
