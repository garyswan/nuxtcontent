‘Paying it forward’ - the Sunshine Coast business community has operated with this ideology for decades. It’s a concept practised by SRJ Walker Wayland that’s helped them develop meaningful relationships with clients and create a local network that thrives on each other’s success.  

SRJWW has been helping to provide a platform through a range of events for local businesses that builds their network and updates them on what’s happening in their industries.

Principal Katrina Brennan and the team have used these events to connect their clients with other businesses on the coast, leading to exciting new collaborations and partnerships.

Sponsoring and partnering with industry events has seen the teamwork alongside industry groups such as Awesome Women in Construction, Caloundra Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturing Excellence Forum and Sunshine Coast Business Awards.   

Katrina believes the business network on the Sunny Coast genuinely wants to see you thrive because if you succeed then the region prospers. They’ve embodied that in how they build relationships with clients by connecting them to the right network that will help them grow. 

SRJWW has been named a Local Business Champion in this year’s Sunshine Coast Council series which highlights local businesses and their contribution to the local industry and community.
