A new event series is set to transform backyards across the Sunshine Coast.

The Backyard Series, proudly brought to you by Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Gardens, will run year-long practical hands-on workshops about how local native plants can be incorporated into a beautiful backyard garden design.

The low-cost workshops will be delivered by experts in the topics and align with the seasonal calendar and will be delivered in partnership with the region’s leading plant nurseries and gardening experts.

The Autumn workshops will focus on backyard basics of caring for soil, designing beautiful cottage and contemporary style native gardens and how to consider diversity as a design principle using layers and levels.

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability Councillor Peter Cox said the workshops aimed to improve backyard biodiversity across the Sunshine coast.

“These workshops are perfect for people who are already interested in gardening, or for people who are just starting their journey into native gardens and designing for biodiversity,” Cr Cox said.

“Everyone is welcome, however the knowledge gained would particularly suit people with small to medium sized blocks who would like improve their backyards to suit our climate, soils and local wildlife.”

Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said Maroochy Bushland Botanic Gardens was an exceptional example of a large native garden in action.

“Local native gardens make your life easier – they are drought tolerant, low maintenance, wildlife friendly, sustainable and can have stunning, vibrant flowers,” Cr Johnston said.

“As an added bonus, by using local natives you can be sure they have evolved to suit our local Sunshine Coast conditions.

“So, whether you’d like a formal, cottage, coastal or contemporary style garden or whether you’re after the perfect native tree or shrub for a screen, or groundcover to draw in the butterflies and bees, this series of events will help you find the perfect native plant for the job.”

Registrations are essential for each event, which costs $20 per workshop.
