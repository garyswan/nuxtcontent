First planned burn of 2023 – these images captured council’s first planned burn of the 2023 season at Ben Bennett Bushland Park in Caloundra, burn management completed on 13 April 2023.

The aim was to manage understory thickening in a Scribbly Gum (Eucalyptus racemosa) forest to protect old habitat trees, the adjacent rainforest and school from unplanned fire.

Some of the trees being protected are hundreds of years old!

We expect other planned burns to take place later in the season, if weather and site conditions permit.
