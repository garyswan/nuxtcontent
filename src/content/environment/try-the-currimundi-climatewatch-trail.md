Did you know Currimundi Lake is home to a ClimateWatch trail, allowing you to record scientific observations and contribute towards conserving our local natural environment?

The trail starts on the sides of Currimundi Lake, leads into the beachfront then heads into coastal bushland situated in the Kathleen McArthur Conservation Park. The trail is a total of 4km and can be accessed through several entry points and exited at any time.

The Currimundi site species include four marine species, five butterflies, sixteen birds and six plants.

Photographs of animals and plants can be taken on your phone and uploaded onto the ClimateWatch app, which will be used to help shape the countryâ€™s scientific response to climate change.

For those attempting the whole loop, there is a section of the lake that requires low tide to complete the loop as the Conservation Park section is an Australian Standard grade three track, so be prepared to get your feet wet and sandy!

For more information, you can download the free app from your app store or head to:\ <https://www.climatewatch.org.au/trails/queensland/sunshine-coast-currimundi-qld>
