Did you know Easter egg foils are recyclable? Once you've enjoyed a delicious chocolate or two (or three, or four or more)... don't toss them away without thought.

Wrap all the foil together, scrunching into a ball the size of a golf ball or bigger and throw in the yellow recycling bin.

It's easy to make a difference towards a cleaner, greener and sustainable Sunshine Coast.
