Years dedicated to restoring the environment and volunteering with Bushcare Sunshine Coast has resulted in Glenn and Judy Burns being presented the 2021 Silver Mattock award.

The couple is involved with the Waterwatch Program run by Maroochy Waterwatch and attend regular working bees with Gulung Gung Bushcare Group at Quota Memorial Park and Namba Creek Group at the Model Railway Park.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said Glenn and Judy Burns were incredibly deserving recipients.

“Glenn and Judy have been involved in the Bushcare Sunshine Coast program for more than 10 years and have been enthusiastic members of Nambour surrounds environmental restoration, for over 30,” Cr Suarez said.

“The pair has donated hundreds of hours of their own time to rehabilitating and enhancing our environment and bushland reserves – and on behalf of our community and council, I thank them.”

First awarded to Jill Chamberlain in 2011, BushCare Sunshine Coast’s Silver Mattock Award is annually presented to a BushCare community volunteer or volunteers for outstanding achievements.

The award is named after a hand tool used for digging, regularly used during BushCare activities. This mattock has been silver-coated, creating an impressive award.

Judy Burns’ volunteer service includes:

*   Co-ordinator and founder of the Woombye Florabunda Pocket Bushcare group
*   Treasurer, Secretary, and member of Petrie Creek Catchment Care Group for 10 years
*   Treasurer of Sunshine Coast and Hinterland Wildlife Preservation Society.

Glenn Burns’ volunteer service includes:

*   Volunteer vegetation management and maintenance of bushwalking tracks within the Conondale National Park
*   Member of Sunshine Coast Bushwalking Group
*   Volunteer monitoring and recording platypus sightings in Petrie Creek.

Glenn and Judy Burns said their work alone was rewarding.   

“We both enjoy the opportunity to work outdoors and, with like-minded others, planting up the Petrie Creek riparian corridor,” Mr Burns said.

“One of the attractions of Nambour is its green heart with its much-appreciated walkway along the creek, and over the years it's been our privilege to help rehabilitate this corridor.

Mrs Burns agreed, saying the couple enjoyed the company of their fellow ‘revegetators’ at working bees, and the morning teas. 

“We see landscape rehabilitation vital to the Sunshine Coast,” Mrs Burns said.

Cr Maria Suarez extended council’s praise to the more than 2000 BushCare volunteers for their contribution to protecting our environment over the past year.

“Year upon year Bushcare volunteers continue to be tremendous contributors to the health of our region’s environment; and in the past year have donated an incredible 12,211 of combined hours of their time,” Cr Suarez said.
