Everyone knows an Australian white ibis, they are the bird at the park on the picnic table, but did you know they are a protected native species that plays an important role in nature?

Help us better understand the ibis and all the great things they do by counting all their friends during national bird week.

You can help by looking for ibis during the nationwide count between Monday, October 17 & Sunday, October 23, 2022 and record your numbers at [Ecosure Australia's website](https://ecosure.com.au/ibis-watch/)
.

The information will assist scientists and decision makers to conserve and manage this important Aussie icon!

For further information, contact via phone Ecosure Ibis Team Co-ordinators Jess Baglin or Carla McKevitt on 07 5508 2046.
