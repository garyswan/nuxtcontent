Councilâ€™s Environmental Health Team have been reducing their carbon footprint, by using an E-Bike approximately 95% of the time in Maroochydore, with zero reduction to service delivery.

Since the first bike was introduced in May 2021 for the Maroochydore area, one team member, Allan, has travelled more than 500kms, completed 354 licensed premises inspections and 304 customer requests.

After the huge success of our first E-Bike the Environmental Health Team has added another one for our Environmental Health Officers. The new bike will be located at the Caloundra Depot servicing Caloundra and surrounding suburbs.

The team estimate more than 200 inspection can be easily serviced using the new bike and the same number of customer requests. Google Maps has only small margins of difference between a car and the bike. The team also saves a lot of time no longer needing to find a carpark.
