Rural landowners can apply for financial help to complete on-ground environment projects on their private property, with Expressions of Interest for Sunshine Coast Council’s Landholder Environment Grants now open.

Grants of up to $15,000 are available for projects like bush regeneration; reducing sediment loss on farms; controlling environmental weeds; modifying non-boundary fencing to make it wildlife friendly; revegetating degraded areas; and to establish vegetation corridors and buffer zones.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the grants were funded by the Environment Levy and delivered on council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy objectives.

“The Landholder Environment Grants help rural property owners enhance their beautiful slice of the Sunshine Coast, which benefits the biodiversity of our whole region,” Cr Suarez said.

“Priority will be given to projects with high ecological value and which have good landowner co-contribution.

“Last year, 60 recipients shared in $229,000 under the Landholder Environment Grants program.

“I encourage rural landholders to check the guidelines to see if they are eligible.”

Only private rural landholders can apply, and the project must occur on privately owned rural land within the Sunshine Coast Local Government area.

Applying is a three-stage process:

1.         Submit an Expression of Interest before 30 August 2021.

2.         Site visit from a council Conservation Partnerships Officer to assess the project and provide any additional guidance.

3.         Apply online before 11 October 2021
