Enjoy a walk back in time through a lush green forest along the river at this important pioneering site.

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers of all abilities.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
This small reserve features an interpretive forest walk with lots of signage designating different species of trees, including Blackbox. There are also large native gingers throughout. Part way round the circuit you can turn right and follow the vehicle access down to the river. Here you will see giant Strangler Figs and nice views upstream to the bridge and downstream as well. You can follow the riverbank downstream on a cow trail to a sandy beach stretch before turning around.

On your way back, you'll come across a pleasant grassy picnic and play area which features two picnic tables.

The Stanley River is a major tributary of the Brisbane River. It extends approximately 35 kms westwards from the south of Maleny through Woodford to Kilcoy before veering southwards.

The bridge over the river is named after one of the pioneering identities in Peachester – Elizabeth Grigor. Elizabeth’s husband, William, was an early settler in Peachester, and ran a sawmill where the bridge is now located. The Grigor family also played an important role in establishing the township of Peachester, building the Crohamhurst State School and many houses in the neighbourhood.

**AFTERWARDS**\
This is a perfect place to enjoy a picnic lunch or you could head back into Peachester where there are two great coffee shops to sit and relax.

For another historical adventure – from Peachester you can follow Knob Road northwards, which will eventually bring you back around into Landsborough where you can explore the Dularcha Train Tunnel either from Landsborough or Mooloolah.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Stanley River Park is just before Elizabeth Grigor Bridge over the Stanley River on the western side of Peachester about 1 km out of town. From Beerwah, follow Beerwah-Kilcoy Road west for about 9 km and you will arrive in Peachester. Keep going through town for another 1 km and the park is on your left. The walk starts here to your right.
