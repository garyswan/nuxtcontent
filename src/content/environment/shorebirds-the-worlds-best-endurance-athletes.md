Some of the world’s best endurance athletes are landing on the Sunshine Coast. Migratory shorebirds fly over 10,000km each year to spend the summer on our coastline.

That’s like flying from Brisbane to LA, but instead of sitting in a comfy airplane seat, these remarkable birds must flap their wings for the entire flight.

They are exhausted when they arrive, so share our shores and keep your distance.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
