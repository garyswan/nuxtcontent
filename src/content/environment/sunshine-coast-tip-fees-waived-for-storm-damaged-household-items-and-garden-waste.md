Fees remain waived at all Sunshine Coast Resource Recovery Centres for household flood and storm damaged items, food and garden waste until close of business this Sunday March 13, 2022.

For Landsborough and Beerwah residents who were impacted by the severe storms earlier this month, free disposal of residential green waste only will be extended for a further week until close of business Sunday, March 20.

This extension will only apply to self-haul green waste taken to the Beerwah and Caloundra Resource Recovery Centres and residents are asked to please bring proof of a Landsborough or Beerwah address.

Council is not providing a kerbside collection for flood damaged goods or green waste and residents who have placed items on the kerbside are asked to make use of the offer of free disposal at council tips.

Council is continuing to work with Volunteering Sunshine Coast to coordinate support for those needing assistance with the removal of flood damaged goods and garden waste.

Residents who need assistance removing these items are encouraged to email Customer.Service\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or text 0456 316 306 (note this number is text only, no calls).

Please provide your name, contact number and address and you will be contacted about your request.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was pleased to continue to support residents with free disposal of storm and flood impacted household items and garden waste.

“There has been a significant uptake from our community for the free disposal and we ask for their continued patience as we expect this weekend to be busy once again,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Staff have been redirected from other areas to help people move through the queue as quickly as possible.

“And good news that our all tips are now able to accept large quantities of garden waste again as stockpile levels have been reduced to manage the expected increase in drop offs.

“We thank our community for their continued understanding as staff work as quickly as they can to safely process the waste and debris from the recent storms and severe weather.”

Buderim second-hand market will be closed this weekend and staff redirected to the resource recovery centre.

Resource Recovery Centre locations are available on [council's website.](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Rubbish-Tip-Locations-and-Fees)
