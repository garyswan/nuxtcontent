The Mooloolaba Boardwalk and Parkland Project has been awarded for its excellence and environmental responsibility in design by the Australian Institute of Horticulture Inc (AIH).  

The *2021 Green Space Urban Award* recognised this signature project’s commitment in preserving the iconic Norfolk Pines, which have become sentinels of the Mooloolaba foreshore.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said this award highlighted council’s commitment to greening built environments, which remained a priority in this spectacular foreshore project.

“It’s a great honour to be recognised by AIH which has been encouraging and developing relationships with like-minded organisations to deliver the highest quality results for horticultural projects since 1960,” Cr Natoli said.

“The Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation project embodies the AIH commitment by increasing public beachfront parkland by 40 per cent – providing significant social, economic, environmental and cultural benefits for locals, visitors and the broader Sunshine Coast region.

“The first part of the new Northern Parkland in Mooloolaba opened Tuesday, November 9, 2021 – delivering new pathway links, scenic boardwalk unlocking new open space areas and amenities which all encourage recreation and improved community health.

“As part of this first stage, I’m pleased to share more than 70 new trees and 5000 new native plants, suitable for our coastal environment, will form part of the park creating more vibrant green spaces for our community.

“Council’s project team focused on removing invasive, noxious weeds, predominantly the Singapore Daisy and Pepper Tree.

“The sub-tropic Pandanus palms were also treated to protect against the Jamella Leafhopper which can cause dieback.

“I congratulate council and its contractor Murphy Builders for working together and undertaking a significant amount of proactive planning to preserve the iconic Norfolk and native vegetation within the site during construction.

“This is all great work which has given us the green-thumbs up from AIH and since opening last week, the boardwalk has received overwhelming positive feedback from our community,” he said.

Council’s commitment to growing our parks and gardens is in response to community feedback received in 2015 during consultation on the Placemaking Mooloolaba Master Plan.

Establishing more open spaces and park areas meets community demand, increases visitation to iconic Mooloolaba and supports council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy as well as the Draft Recreation Parks Plan.
