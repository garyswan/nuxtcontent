An ambitious vision to restore cleared grazing land to original lush rainforest in a “new kind of park” has been revealed by Sunshine Coast Council, with the community invited to have their say on the proposal.

This comes with the release of the draft master plan for the proposed Sunshine Coast Ecological Park, which features numerous highlights including two treetop bridges, a forest lookout with 360 degree views over the Glass House Mountains and down to the coast, a community pavilion, operations and research facility and “forest rooms” for play, discovery, rest and contemplation.

The 65ha land parcel, currently used for cattle grazing, lies in Jinibara country adjacent to the existing Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve at Maleny, and within the Mountain View Green Space, one of the Sunshine Coast’s five major green spaces.

The plan aims to create a place where humans and nature co-habitate, with ecosystems thriving alongside spaces for the community and visitors to experience ecological restoration through education, play spaces and nature-based recreation.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the proposed project would restore pre-colonisation rainforests and wetlands, but it would take decades for ecosystem function to recover and flourish.

“In 30 years and beyond, council wants our next generations to benefit from the decisions we make today,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Over time, we’ll have the privilege of watching the ecosystems in this park recover as species return to the restored forest and wetland.”

With the Sunshine Coast officially recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere, Mayor Jamieson said council remained committed to major projects such as this, demonstrating our future focus to enhance our national and international reputation and support our economy, lifestyle and environment.

“This is an ambitious vision, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“My hope is the community will embrace this park as their own as a place to immerse in nature, connect with each other and be inspired to continue our sustainability journey.”

The Sunshine Coast Ecological Park is a key transformational action in the Environment and Liveability Strategy, which aims to deliver a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast now and looking forward to 2041 and beyond.

Environment and Liveability portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the draft master plan would be open to community feedback on council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sc-eco-park-master-plan)
&#x20;until March 20.  

“This proposal will provide a unique park for the whole community, and council is committed to listening to community feedback to ensure a strong plan for the Sunshine Coast Ecological Park,” Cr Cox said.

“In this third round of community consultation for the proposed park, residents and visitors can help council determine whether this plan will meet our growing community’s needs and aspirations.”

The draft master plan was developed with input from an excellence advisory panel, community reference group, and an engagement-led design approach that invited the community to help shape the park’s mix of recreation, green space and ecological conservation.

## **Fast facts**

*   An ecological park is a type of park that supports nature-based recreation, education, and research, while protecting, celebrating, and restoring the site’s inherent environmental, natural, and cultural heritage values.

*   The Sunshine Coast Ecological Park draft master plan sets out four interconnected yet distinct precincts across the park: The Rainforest, The Heart, The Hub, and the Waterways.

*    The final stage three community engagement closes 5pm March 20, 2023.

*   The vision for the Sunshine Coast Ecological Park is underpinned by six core values:

    1.  An ecologically valuable, resilient and connected landscape
    2.  A place that welcomes people to learn, play and contribute to the future
    3.  A place inspired by nature
    4.  An immersive experience that promotes balance, respite and revival
    5.  A place of expected and spontaneous discovery
    6.  A place that shares the stories of local people and the natural history of the region.
