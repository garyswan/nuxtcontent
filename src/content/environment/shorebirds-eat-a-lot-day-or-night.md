Low tide is for feeding; high tide is for sleeping.

No matter what time of day or night, shorebirds feed during low tide, when their favourite food on sandbanks and mudflats is accessible. Migratory shorebirds eat up to one-third of their body weight each day!

Thatâ€™s a lot of effort, so when the sandbanks become submerged at high tide, they find a nearby dry beach or rock where they can sleep and rest. Share our shores and keep your distance to avoid disturbing resting or feeding shorebirds.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
