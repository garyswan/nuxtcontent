A small section of Dicky Beach is closed until further notice after Sunshine Coast Council deemed the historic SS Dicky wreck extremely unsafe for our community.

The safety risk comes after remnants of the wreck were repeatedly exposed from erosion associated with natural coastal processes.

The beach is closed 20 metres either side of the submerged wreck, with two red flags and warning signs on poles to warn beach goers, swimmers and surfers to keep clear and always avoid the wreck’s location.

New signs installed to close a 40m section of the beach and warn beach goers of the hazard.

Sunshine Coast Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said council’s priority was to make the Dicky Beach foreshore safe for the community and visitors.

“Council recognises that sometimes the wreck is covered by sand and doesn’t present a risk however beach conditions can change in an instant, and in that instant, when the wreck is exposed,  it’s decaying shell is sharp and dangerous,” Cr Landsberg said.

“More often than not people aren’t aware that the wreck is exposed because it’s submerged under the water.

“Our office has received notifications of injuries already that have occurred with swimmers within the area, and these actions are being implemented to ensure the safety of any recreational beach users.

“The bathing reserve is closed 20 metres either side of the wreck – beach users, swimmers and surfers must stay out of this exclusion zone.”

Cr Landsberg said closing a small section of the beach was necessary for community safety.

“If small segments of the wreck are removed, it will likely still become exposed and continue to put our community at risk of serious injury,” Cr Landsberg said.

“This is why council is also exploring other longer-term measures – such as removing the entire wreck – to safeguard this area into the future with the aim to reopen the beach when safe to do so.

“We request people to take note of the signage and always stay clear of the wreck.”

A full risk assessment was undertaken as part of the decision to close the beach, which included input from industry experts and Surf Life Saving Queensland (Dicky Beach branch).

In 2015, parts of the wreck were removed following a strict protocol.
