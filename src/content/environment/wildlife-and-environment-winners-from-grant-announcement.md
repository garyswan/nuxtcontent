Nineteen Sunshine Coast environmental community groups can continue to focus on their core work,  caring for our precious wildlife and stunning natural environment, thanks to the added support from the local council’s Environment Levy Partnership Funding Program.

The groups will share in $610,000 each year for the next three years, subject to completing a yearly progress report and the adoption of council’s annual Environment Levy budget.

The three-year partnership provides certainty for the groups, enabling them to engage in longer term planning and capacity building.

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability joint portfolio councillor Maria Suarez said the funding contributed to the groups’ operational expenses, allowing volunteers to continue providing a vital service to our wildlife and environment, while supporting the delivery of the Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability Strategy.

“We are very grateful for their commitment and dedication to our region,” Cr Suarez said.

“Last financial year, 3733 volunteers from our 20 partner groups donated more than 400,000 hours of their own time to improve our environment and look after our wildlife.

“Amazingly, this equates to more than $12 million in contributions towards our environment.

“That shows the value of the Environment Levy right there – as this grant program would not be possible without the contributions made by property owners through their rate payments.”

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability joint portfolio councillor Peter Cox said 18 continuing and one new partnership had been approved at today’s (19 August 2021) Ordinary Meeting of council.

“Bat Rescue, Wildlife Volunteers Association (WILVOS), Twinnies Pelican and Seabird Rescue, Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors, and Glasshouse Mountains Advancement Network (GMAN) can continue to support, rescue and nurse our native animals back to health,” Cr Cox said.

“Petrie Creek Catchment Care Group, Night Eyes Association, Mary River Catchment Coordination Association, Currimundi Catchment Care Group, Hinterland Bush Links, Barung Landcare Association, Coolum and North Shore Coast Care, Lake Baroon Catchment Care Group, ECOllaboration Ltd, Reef Check Australia, Mooloolah River Waterwatch and Landcare, Wildlife Queensland - Sunshine Coast and Hinterland and Friends of Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Gardens can continue to restore and preserve our waterways and hinterland and coastal environments.

“And we welcome one new organisation, Wildcare, to the Environment Levy Partnerships Program.

“Wildcare Australia is a well-established and respected wildlife rescue and rehabilitation group that has increased its service on the Sunshine Coast over the last two years.

“Over the coming years, council officers will work with these successful partner organisations to ensure that, collaboratively, we realise from this investment not just great environmental outcomes but great financial results for our ratepayers.

“Most importantly, these partnerships are about council working with our community to protect and enhance our natural environment as we continue to build a pathway to a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast.”
