To celebrate International Day of Biosphere Reserves in November, Sunshine Coast Council is encouraging people to share their connection to our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.

Residents can show how they embrace sustainability where they live, work, play and learn by submitting photographs to the inaugural *Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere* photo showcase before October 5.

Creative efforts will be rewarded with selected photographs curated into a special showcase which includes an exhibition that can be viewed during November, and the chance to win a share in an award prize pool of $3500\*.

The Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere photography showcase launch is timed to coincide with International Day of Biosphere Reserves.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said our Sunshine Coast Biosphere was a special place where responsible development, people working, living and playing sustainably, sit alongside active conservation.

“We hope this photography showcase will encourage novice or professional photographers to share their images and connection to our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.” said Mayor Jamieson.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the showcase would capture, in images, the spirit of how our community connected within our region.

“They can share a love for local plants and animals, the way we interact in our green spaces, beaches and waterways and celebrate our people, stunning landscapes and vistas,” Cr Suarez said.

“These shared images and stories will become a valuable memory capsule to look back on in future years.”

**Entries close:** Wednesday, October 5

Photographs must be local Sunshine Coast content.

Images must be owned by the entrant who must also have authority to provide council with permission to publish the submitted photo, and photographs to be provided in a high-resolution digital format.
