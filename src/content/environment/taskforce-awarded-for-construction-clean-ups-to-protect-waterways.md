A special taskforce introduced to protect the Sunshine Coast’s prized waterways from development-related pollution and erosion has been acknowledged with a major award.

Sunshine Coast Council is celebrating the achievements of its Construction Management and Waterway Protection Taskforce.

This follows the team winning the National Award in Policy and Education at Stormwater Australia’s National Awards for Excellence in Sydney on March 29.

This coveted accolade moves Council another step closer to achieving its vision of being ‘Australia’s most sustainable region’.

Council introduced the taskforce in 2021 to partner, educate and implement erosion and sediment control across the region

The team has been monitoring and educating all parts of the construction sector and working with the industry to avoid site run-off and erosion that may damage our prized waterways or clog roadside gutters or stormwater drains.

The taskforce is there to ensure residential builders, contractors and developers are aware of their legislated environmental responsibilities.

To date, the team has completed 574 building site inspections and education sessions across 121 unique building companies and conducted 186 inspections and education sessions for large civil sites, across 26 unique civil contractors.

Manager Development Services Patricia Jensen said Council’s taskforce had been a catalyst for positive change in the construction sector, improving the industry’s environmental performance.

Ms Jensen said there had been three key components behind the success of this taskforce:

*   Engagement with industry - developers, builders, contractors and consultants
*   Education to a range of internal and external stakeholders to enable them to succeed
*   Measuring performance and development of metrics, so progress can be tracked and ongoing  momentum ensured.

Ms Jensen congratulated the team members who had made Council’s taskforce so successful, including Richard MacGillivray, Rob Sewell, Rupert Hindley, Lisa Meilak, Michelle Walker, Samantha Middleton, Michelle Lowe and Sally Welch.

“We could not have achieved this fantastic recognition for this Taskforce without funding from Council’s Environment Levy."

Manager Development Services Patricia Jensen

“We hope that the great work being done by the Taskforce can continue after its three-year project timeframe.” Visit Council’s website for more information on the [Construction Management and Waterway Protection Taskforce.](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Rivers-and-Coast/Erosion-and-Sediment-Control)
