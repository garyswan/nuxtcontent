Three butterflies in flight, a foamy beach dog and glow in the dark fungi… here’s proof the Sunshine Coast is picture perfect!

A Sunshine Coast Council photographic competition to celebrate the region’s recent designation as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve has attracted a spectacular response.

Entrants were invited to share their photographs of how they live, work and play.

The showcase also follows the first UNESCO International Day of the Biosphere Reserve on November 3.

Just four other sites in Australia are Biosphere Reserves, including the Great Sandy, Noosa, Fitzgerald (WA), plus Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula and Western Port reserve.

It is a huge coup and sees our region recognised as an international site of excellence and an area of natural beauty, where there is a commitment to responsible development and people working, living and playing sustainably.

Judges had a tough job narrowing down almost 300 photographic entries from people of all ages and abilities to 40 finalists.

The Best of Exhibition winner was Jo Ward, who captured an exceptionally rare moment of both male and female Richmond Birdwing Butterflies in flight at Point Cartwright.

**BEST OF EXHIBITION WINNER**

**‘Male and Female Richmond Birdwing Butterflies’ by Jo Ward.**

‘Male and Female Richmond Birdwing Butterflies’ by Jo Ward.

Artist Statement: *“A whale count held at Point Cartwright was made difficult by the distracting presence of the Richmond Birdwing Butterflies that repeatedly danced around us. Knowing them to be endangered, I posted some photographs to a social media group. This led to a gentleman who had spearheaded efforts to plant their food source in the area to comment and close the gap on a 30-year project to maintain their presence in the area. An amazing 'boots on the ground' success story. (We also counted 58 Humpbacks - their increasing numbers are another amazing success story!)”*

Judge’s Comments: *“It’s hard not to be distracted by these butterflies, their size and striking colourful patterns are unique and exquisite! For me, this image sums up the ideal of a biosphere; the instance of these butterflies is a great barometer in helping us humans to be conscious of our impact in work and play in our region.”*

**‘Cotton harlequin bug’ by Tina Sinclair.**

‘Cotton harlequin bug’ by Tina Sinclair.

Artist Statement: *“A key benefit of working in Mooloolaba is to enjoy the view of the beautiful beach and waterways. Often in my lunchbreak I would eat my lunch at Pacific Park or Bindaree Crescent Park making the most of my limited time to get some vitamin D and stretch my legs. Finding the brightly covered Cotton Harlequin Bugs in the Cotton Trees was always a bonus.”*

Judge’s Comment: *“Lovely close up image of the Harlequin bug really shows the bright and iridescent orange and blue colours.”*

‘Natural light through the night’ by Kale Jelley.

Artist Statement: *“I decided to go for a night walk as the moon was bright and the air was cool. Behind the sand dunes, Deep in the vine thickets of the swampy melaleucas was the glow of the mycena chlorophos.”*

Judge’s Comments: *“This is an extraordinary sight and captures the uniqueness of flora in the dunes – wonderful to know these small treasures exist!”*

‘Our Faraway Tree’ by Rohan Albury.

Artist Statement: *“We are lucky enough to have a forest behind our home in Mons. This was one of our first times exploring the forest and we were all in awe of the majestic trees. The children quickly named this Our Faraway Tree. They have spent many hours playing, climbing and exploring the flora and fauna in our forest.”*

Judge’s Comments: *“What a poignant moment of discovery in what lies in our Sunshine Coast backyards? The size of the old tree in comparison to the child really shows the scale of age and how we must respect our environment.”*

‘Milky Way stops’ by Ryan Abelgas.

Artist Statement: *“After our shift ended, my co-worker and I had planned to go stargazing at Point Cartwright. We had no idea that night was the Milky Way's peak! We were both in awe as we watched the band of light stretch the horizon over Sunny Coast. Thankful that we live in a place where work-life balance exists.”*

Judge’s Comments: *‘Clever composition and use of diagonal lines to direct your eye through the whole image and a lucky moment to capture the Milky Way peak!'*

Artist Statement: *“I was walking around Mt Coolum park and I heard the Fairy Wrens calling their calm call.
