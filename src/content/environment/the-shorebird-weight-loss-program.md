The epic journey undertaken each year by migratory shorebirds is a fantastic weight loss program. These birds lose more than half their body weight on their migration!

When they arrive on our coast, they are starving and start feeding immediately.

Share our shores and keep your distance from feeding shorebirds.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
