This February 16-18, join Healthy Land and Water, Sunshine Coast Council, and more than 30 stakeholder groups, who’ve been collaborating for more than a decade, to preserve and improve the values of our Pumicestone Passage and its catchment.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the *Pumicestone Catchment Convergence 2021: Insights for a healthy future,* was an exciting three-day event at USC that would review what we already know about the Pumicestone Catchment, and identify how we can continue working together to conserve and restore this special area.

“The Pumicestone Passage and its catchment has high environmental values, it’s part of the Ramsar-listed Moreton Bay Marine Park and encompasses our spectacular Glass House Mountains,” Cr Cox said. 

“Its sheltered waters are a place where locals and visitors can reconnect with nature and its diverse habitats sustain regional fisheries, marine turtles, dugong and more bird species than Kakadu – making its protection even more important.

“The event hosted by Healthy Land and Water in collaboration with community, research, industry, government and Traditional Owner groups, will bring together wisdom, knowledge and know-how, galvanising interest and energy for a healthy future for the Pumicestone Passage and its catchment.

“There is an extensive and diverse line-up of local speakers, including Sunshine Coast Council staff.

“Knowledge gathered through the event will help to inform the next Pumicestone Catchment Action Plan and an updated SEQ Natural Resource Management Plan.

“Together these plans will support our preservation and enjoyment of the Passage and its catchment into the future.”
