Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere leaders have converged to envision our Biosphere in 2032, a year on from the [historic designation](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/news/Sunshine-Coast-officially-becomes-a-UNESCO-biosphere-160622)
&#x20;of the region as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Mayor Mark Jamieson, who is also Biosphere Coordinating Committee chair, said the essential groundwork was being laid to ensure the success and shared purpose of our Biosphere.

The Biosphere designation recognises our region as an international site of excellence and an area of natural beauty, where there is a commitment to responsible development and people working, living and playing sustainably alongside active conservation.

The Mayor said projects like the [Biosphere Photography Showcase](https://oursc.com.au/community/arts/picture-perfect-the-stunning-images-that-best-celebrate-our-region)
&#x20;and the current [Kids in Action program](https://oursc.com.au/environment/capes-on-biospheroes-adventure-begins)
, themed “BiospHeroes”, celebrated our community partnerships.

“Much of the work so far has been building on the foundations of our Biosphere governance and objectives,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This is complex and important work that is an imperative for every UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. 

“This sets our Biosphere on the path to a more sustainable future, which benefits the community and economy while strengthening our natural environment.”

This work culminated in the recent inaugural joint meeting of the two Biosphere governance bodies, the Community Advisory Group and the Coordinating Committee.

The inaugural joint meeting of the Sunshine Coast Biosphere Community Advisory Group and Coordinating Committee.

At this event, representatives considered a vision for the region in 2032 and discussed challenges and opportunities ahead for the region in the next decade and beyond.

The Community Advisory Group advises Biosphere implementation matters and includes representatives of First Nations Traditional Custodians and people across sectors and interest areas including tourism, environmental conservation, youth, agriculture, business, residents, academic and residential property development.

The Coordinating Committee provides leadership and direction for the management of the Biosphere and has a key role in decision making on implementation priorities.

### A Biosphere vision for 2032

Community Advisory Group chair Will Shrapnel said members envisaged a Sunshine Coast Biosphere of sustainability leadership and innovation, enhancing outcomes for people and the environment and fostering a community where connection to nature is a core value.

“This inaugural joint meeting was a major milestone recognising the partnership approach to implementing our Biosphere,” Mr Shrapnel said.

“It strengthened the ability of our diverse community representatives to help set key directions for a sustainable Sunshine Coast and how we get there, underpinned by shared values.

“This was an opportunity to recognise our capacity to shape the future of the region within our individual and collective spheres of influence, as we evolve over the coming years to further build an empowered community on Biosphere matters.”
