A rare image of Richmond Birdwing butterflies in flight at Point Cartwright, has taken out the People’s Choice award for the Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere Reserve Photography Showcase.

Jo Ward’s beautiful image received nearly 150 votes and was also awarded Best of Showcase by the showcase selector earlier this month.

The community and judges agree, Jo’s image and story is a winner!

The photographer had been participating in a whale count held at Point Cartwright and shares that this was made difficult by the distracting presence of the Richmond Birdwing Butterflies that repeatedly danced around us.

Knowing the species to be endangered, Jo later posted some photographs to a social media group.

Where a gentleman who had spearheaded efforts to plant the butterflies’ food source reached out to Jo and shared details of 30-year project to maintain their presence in the area.

The image and story are a great example of the results of active conservation.

The showcase celebrated the region’s recent designation as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve has attracted a spectacular response.

Entrants were invited to capture the spirit of the Biosphere by sharing photographs of what they love – celebrating people and nature.

After finalists were selected, community members were invited to vote for their favourites to win the Peoples’ Choice for a chance to win themselves a prize.

**Top 5 Biosphere Images as chosen by you**

**1) Male and Female Richmond Birdwing Butterflies by Jo Ward**

*Artist Statement: A whale count held at Point Cartwright was made difficult by the distracting presence of the Richmond Birdwing Butterflies that repeatedly danced around us. Knowing them to be endangered, I posted some photographs to a social media group. This led to a gentleman who had spearheaded efforts to plant their food source in the area to comment and close the gap on a 30-year project to maintain their presence in the area. An amazing 'boots on the ground' success story. (We also counted 58 Humpbacks - their increasing numbers are another amazing success story!)*

**2) Cheeky Mistletoe bird by Toni Moran**

*Artist Statement: On an afternoon stroll around Currimundi Lake (Kathleen McArthur) Conservation Park I saw two adult Mistletoe Birds flitting around, chasing food. I stopped to watch them, heard a tiny squeaky call and turned to see this most gorgeous little floof ball, that almost looks like a tiny muppet, waiting patiently on a branch for the juicy bugs Mum and Dad were chasing.*

**3) Natural light through the night by Kale Jelley**

*Artist Statement: I decided to go for a night walk as the moon was bright and the air was cool. Behind the sand dunes, deep in the vine thickets of the swampy melaleucas was the glow of the mycena chlorophos.*

**4) Milky Way stops by Ryan Abelgas**

*Artist Statement: After our shift ended, my co-worker and I had planned to go stargazing at Point Cartwright. We had no idea that night was the Milky Way's peak! We were both in awe as we watched the band of light stretch the horizon over Sunny Coast. Thankful that we live in a place where work-life balance exists.*

**5) Boardwalk to the Mountain by Cody Laskey**

*Artist Statement: From this angle the boardwalk along the Mount Coolum coastline looks like it travels all the way to the base of Mount Coolum. The clouds on this particular overcast day set the tone nicely for the photograph.*
