Kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons – collectively known as Macropods – are much-loved Sunshine Coast animals and a new plan is set to protect them into the future.

The Draft Sunshine Coast Macropod Conservation Plan calls for a strong partnership between Sunshine Coast Council, our community and Queensland Government agencies and outlines a list of actions Council can undertake to contribute towards helping the species thrive.

Now, Sunshine Coast Council is calling on the community to view the plan and prioritise some of these actions at [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/draft-macropod-conservation-plan)
&#x20;before June 5, 2023.

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said Council aimed to protect macropods and address the challenges our region faced in protecting them.

“It’s pretty special to be able to watch an eastern grey kangaroo lounging around the local golf course or a pademelon hop through a Sunshine Coast reserve,” Cr Suarez said.

“Like us, macropods are widespread and highly mobile – their home is now also our home, and our community is growing.

“It’s no surprise that this brings challenges to their survival.

“The Sunshine Coast community has told us how much they value these animals, and in partnership with our local wildlife rescue groups and macropod ecologists, Council has prepared a Draft Sunshine Coast Macropod Plan to guide the future protection of macropods across our urban landscape.”

### Science and research have gone into developing the draft plan.

Council’s Fauna Movement Study and Gene Flow Analysis, which was conducted in partnership with UniSC, has provided a better understanding of the key movement pathways of macropods across the Sunshine Coast Local Government Area.

The draft plan includes actions to further verify this work and develop guidelines for development, habitat protection and recommendations for the installation of infrastructure that could prevent wildlife collisions.

## The call to work together

Sunshine Coast Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Cr Peter Cox said a united approach was needed.

“Council can only manage what happens on its own land – it does not have responsibility for areas that are managed by a private entity, such as a developer, or Queensland Government,” Cr Cox said.

“This is why the plan highlights the importance of strong partnerships with all stakeholders across the Sunshine Coast.

“Together, we can live in a wildlife friendly biosphere.”

Macropods covered by the draft plan are our kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons and the Macropod Conservation Plan has been funded through your Sunshine Coast Environment Levy.
