The Coastal Fox Control Program will be underway again this autumn in an effort to protect our native wildlife from the predatory fox in coastal bushland areas from Maroochy River to Peregian Springs.

Sunshine Coast Council, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Coolum and North Shore Coast Care and Noosa Council will work together to carry out the program between April 21 and May 21, 2021.

Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the program had achieved extremely positive results during its six years and it was vital the valuable work continued.

“The program plays an important part in protecting our endangered and threatened species,” Cr Suarez said.

“We appreciate the support our community has given this program in the past and with their ongoing support, we can continue to ensure the longevity and security of native species.”

The program is designed to impact fox populations at a time when they were particularly active and reduce fox predation on vulnerable populations of native species, such as water mice, Eastern ground parrots, and endangered green and loggerhead turtles at the egg and hatchling stage.

More information about the program is available on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Invasive-plants-and-animals/Invasive-animals/Managing-Invasive-Animals/What-council-is-doing/Coastal-fox-control-program)
.

Residents living near the program areas will be notified.

Areas included in the control program will be clearly identified by warning signs at all entrances. Please ensure your pets do not roam.

If you spot a suspected fox den in the program area, report it to council on 5475 7272. You can also view the fact sheet to [learn how to identify a fox den](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Invasive-plants-and-animals/Invasive-animals/Invasive-animals-of-our-region/Priority-Invasive-Animals/Fox)
&#x20;on council’s website.

The European red fox is a restricted pest under the Queensland Government *Biosecurity Act 2014*.

Under the *Biosecurity Act 2014*, managing biosecurity, which includes invasive animals and plants, is a key responsibility of council and every Sunshine Coast resident.
