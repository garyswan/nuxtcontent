IT's National Student Volunteer week and we are sending a BIG thanks to all the students who volunteered in our BushCare Mates program over the last 12 months.

In a combined effort - 11 schools and youth groups made a big impact to their local environment with 455 students and 38 teachers planting 2,963 native trees, shrubs and ground covers and hand-weeding (WOW) 78 wheelie bins (double WOW) of environmental weeds from council’s environment reserves.

The eleven schools and youth groups who volunteered with us over the last 12 months were:

-Rustic Pathways

-Caloundra State High School – Lighthouse program, year 11 and 12s

-Pacific Lutheran College – year 6s

-Bray Park State High School – year 10

-Buddina State School – year 6

-Caloundra State School – year 5

-Chancellor State College – year 10 & 11

-Glasshouse Christian College – year 9

-Kairos Community College – year 10

-Montessori International College

-Nambour Christian College – year 11

-Noosa Flexible Learning Centre

The feedback from our BushCare team is that school students have never been more aware or concerned about their environment and love these opportunities to take action.

That is why BushCare Mates was created - a youth conservation program that uses bushcare and tree planting to educate and inspire students to connect with their local environment while taking real action.

Watch this video to see why.

Several of these schools have also partnered with us to enable their students to complete hours for their community service programs.
