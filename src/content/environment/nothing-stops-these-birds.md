Kia Ora! Each winter, our sandbanks in the Maroochy River and Pumicestone Passage welcome special visitors from across the ditch: Double-banded Plovers (Charadrius bicinctus).

Unlike all other migratory shorebirds which come to Australia in summer, Double-banded Plovers spend autumn and winter in Australia.

Each year, they travel from New Zealand where they breed during summer.

Grab your binoculars and see if you can spot those tiny birds before they return to New Zealand.

As their name suggests, they can be easily recognised by two dark bands across their white chest.

You can share our shoreline with these long-distance travellers by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars.

*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities.

*   Keeping your dogs under control.

*   Taking your rubbish home.To learn more about shorebirds on the Sunshine Coast watch our series on
