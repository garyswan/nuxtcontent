Ever wondered what happens to the rainwater that drains from your roof, driveway and yard once it leaves your property?

It’s likely that it enters Sunshine Coast Council’s extensive stormwater network, captured by a series of drains and is carried through underground pipes, before being discharged into local waterways draining to the ocean.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said council was developing its first Stormwater Management Strategy (SMS) and was now seeking community input, because everyone in the region has a role to play to manage stormwater effectively.

“Stormwater management protects our waterways from pollutants and increased or concentrated water flow, uses rainwater and stormwater as a resource and manages stormwater flood risk for the wellbeing and resilience of our communities,” Cr Suarez said.

“This is done through appropriate planning and policy decisions, development guidance and providing and managing stormwater infrastructure.

“Stormwater flooding is typically very localised and is sometimes referred to as flash flooding. It is different to creek or river flooding and storm surge events, which are generally considered to be regional types of flooding.

“Meeting the stormwater management needs of our growing community in a changing climate is critical to delivering a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast.

“Stormwater management affects everyone on the Sunshine Coast, and everyone has a role to play.

“Council owns and manages more than $1.5 billion worth of stormwater assets. This includes more than 1500 kilometres of pipes and culverts – that’s almost the equivalent of travelling from the Sunshine Coast to Cairns.” 

Joint Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said council’s [Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS)](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;outlined a target to deliver stormwater assets that were effective and responsive to our changing environment, together with stormwater management processes that protected the natural and built environment.

“Stormwater assets in recent years have become more diverse and complex, and now include many vegetated assets which also aim to improve water quality and amenity,” Cr Cox said.

“The Stormwater Management Strategy aims to identify existing and future issues relating to stormwater management and outlines how they will be addressed.

“Community feedback will help to inform the final strategy and ensure council is addressing concerns. Our residents are our eyes and ears on the ground and we value the local knowledge as it helps deliver effective stormwater assets, now and into the future.

“The Stormwater Management Strategy builds on the work done in the ELS and complements other major projects such as [Blue Heart Sunshine Coast](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/blueheart)
&#x20;and the [Coastal Hazard Adaptation Strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Coastal-Hazard-Adaptation-Strategy)
.

“Together, these strategies and projects proactively consider future flooding and stormwater risks and help us achieve our vision – Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.”

The vision for stormwater management in 2041 is that “\_s\_\_tormwater is managed for community wellbeing and resilience, facilitated by an integrated stormwater network that is effective, sustainable and contributes to waterway health\_”.

The three key objectives of the Stormwater Management Strategy are:

1.  **Resilient and smart.** Wellbeing and resilience are enhanced by increased stormwater awareness, clever planning and good design.
2.  **Protected and healthy.** Stormwater management protects the natural and built environment and supports healthy communities.
3.  **Coordinated and well managed.** Stormwater assets are effective and responsive to a changing environment.

To provide your feedback and help shape the region’s future stormwater management, visit [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/open-consultation)
&#x20;to complete our online survey or email council a written submission to smsfeedback\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au by 5pm Friday 14 May 2021.

Maintenance requests relating to stormwater can be submitted online via [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council/Request-for-Service-Online-Form)
. Urgent or hazardous situations should be reported by calling council on 5475 7272.
