The grass is looking greener for Sunshine Coast parks and playgrounds and it’s not from the recent deluge. Sunshine Coast Council has committed $9.3 million to give almost 300 parks a facelift this financial year.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said Sunshine Coast suburbs would see new playgrounds installed, upgrades to new soft-fall, toddler play areas, shade sails, picnic tables and shelters.

“This is the beginning of our major facelift this financial year with upgrades taking place in Glass House Mountains, Beerwah, Buderim, Sippy Downs, Nambour and Peregian,” Cr Law said.

“Council’s Parks and Gardens Team maintains 1085 parks across the Sunshine Coast – 493 are recreation parks and 360 are playgrounds.

"That’s a staggering number of facilities which are maintained and upgraded each year –facilities the whole community can enjoy."

“That’s a staggering number of facilities which are maintained and upgraded each year –facilities the whole community can enjoy.”

Next month upgrades will begin on the Brightwater Community Park to replace the rubber soft-fall on the junior playground. Works are scheduled to start late April and will be complete in late May, weather and construction conditions permitting.

“Families are already enjoying the renewal and replacement of the existing multi-play unit which was completed in February at Cliff Hargreaves Park, in the scenic spot by Currimundi Lake,” Cr Law said.

“I’m also pleased to see in Division 10 the Quota Memorial Park shelter replacement and footpath completed in March. It’s a great gathering space to enjoy a lunchtime barbecue with friends and family at the new picnic shelter with lunch sizzling away on the new single plate barbecue.”

This financial year works will begin on a new playground and pathway for Beerwah’s Settlement Park, a renewed playground for Glass House Mountain’s Clearview Park and a toddler play area for Buderim’s Cumberland Way Park.

Albany Lakes Park precinct upgrade in Sippy Downs is another new playground being designed with council funding and a grant from the Queensland Government’s Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package.

Works are expected to be completed mid-year on the renewal of the existing play space, improved access and connecting pathway, tree planting plus more.

Environment and Liveability Councillor Peter Cox said these upgrades actively contributed to council’s vision: Australia’s most sustainable region – Healthy, Smart, Creative.

“These areas have been established for active and passive recreation for our community, and to preserve our landscape features and natural environment of the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Cox said.

“Council planted 1511 street trees last year and increased its total area of lawn and gardens by 11.3 hectares. That’s equivalent to 11 football fields. This is all part of council’s commitment and enjoyment to watch our open spaces grow into community hubs.

“We want to embrace the opportunity to provide facilities and nature-based parks for all communities, parents and children.

“I also want to mention the great work our Parks and Gardens team contributes to keeping our plethora of green spaces looking the very best they can for our community.

“The team members are nature lovers at heart, who enjoy planning, delivering and nurturing spaces that blend biodiversity and landscape with our built environment.”
