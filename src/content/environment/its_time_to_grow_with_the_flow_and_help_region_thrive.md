Love our beautiful environment? Here’s your chance to take part in an event that will enhance it for generations to come and improve your wellbeing.

You are invited to plant native trees, take some home and immerse yourself in nature through low-cost outdoor yoga, meditation or Pilates as part of [Parks Week 2023](http://www.parks-week.org/)
, which starts on Saturday, March 4.  

This Parks Week celebrates the theme ‘\_How spending time in our parks and open spaces positively influences our wellbeing\_’. The Sunshine Coast is beaming with inviting green spaces that play a fundamental role in creating liveable cities and thriving communities.

As part of this year’s event, the community is encouraged to roll up their sleeves, head outdoors and enjoy the many activities taking place.

Sunshine Coast residents can team up with the friendly and experienced Parks and Gardens team from Sunshine Coast Council to plant native trees and also collect a native tree to plant at home.

They can also join Council’s Healthy Sunshine Coast program for outdoor yoga, meditation or Pilates.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the week provided a rare opportunity for people to unite to improve the area’s natural assets.

“Each tree planted will help provide food and habitat for our local wildlife and create more shade for park users,” Cr Suarez said.

“They will also provide important environmental, social and economic benefits, such as sequestering carbon, producing oxygen, filtering pollutants and cooling our local surrounds.”

She said it was a great time to explore some of our region's unique and beautiful parks and gardens.

During Parks Week, [Healthy Sunshine Coast](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/living-and-community/community-support/healthy-and-active/healthy-sunshine-coast)
&#x20;encourages everyone to get active, have fun and meet new friends.

The program is an affordable and holistic community health and wellbeing initiative providing low-cost activities in some of council’s most beautiful park locations.
