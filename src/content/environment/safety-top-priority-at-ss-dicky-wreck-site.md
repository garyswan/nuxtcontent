Sunshine Coast Council is working towards the removal of the SS Dicky Wreck, as repeated erosion continues to expose its sharp remnants.

The plan was set in motion at today’s Ordinary Meeting of Council when commitment was made towards a permanent solution to make the Dicky Beach foreshore safe for the community and visitors.

It includes either removing the majority or all of the wreck and was acknowledged it could take some time for it to be implemented.

#### In the short term, other temporary protection measures have been implemented including:  

*   temporary partial bathing reserve closure 20 metres each side of the wreck (40 metres total)
*   installation of new prominent signage and red flags to identify the hazard and bathing reserve closure zone
*   increased public warnings from the Dicky Beach Surf Lifesaving Club
*   map and information flyer distributed to Dicky Beach Caravan Park and other relevant local businesses
*   Dicky Beach Surf Lifesaving Club to notify council of all incidents or hazards related to the wreck.

Sunshine Coast Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said it was a substantial operation to remove the wreck but community safety was council’s top priority.

“In 2015, parts of the wreck were removed following a strict protocol – total removal was considered but as it is very difficult and expensive to do this partial removal was deemed to be the best option at that time.

“However, the repeated exposure of the wreck due to the natural costal processes and its continued deterioration means we have reached a point where this option needed to be seriously considered for our community’s safety.

“There are strict Queensland Government cultural heritage protocols council needs to follow and it is likely to be a lengthy process.

“Council will work closely with the Department of Environment and Science to ensure all necessary preservation processes are followed.”

Cr Landsberg said the SS Dicky didn’t need to be insitu for its historical significance to be remembered.

“A new fantastic interpretive display to learn more about the ship is due to be completed in the coming months in the park dedicated to its name,” Cr Landsberg said.

“In the meantime, we request people to take note of the signage and always stay clear of the wreck.”

A full risk assessment was undertaken as part of the decision, which included input from industry experts and Surf Life Saving Queensland (Dicky Beach branch).

### Recent background

*   The safety risk comes after remnants of the wreck were repeatedly exposed from erosion associated with natural coastal processes.
*   The beach is closed 20 metres either side of the submerged wreck, with two red flags and warning signs on poles to warn beach goers, swimmers and surfers to keep clear and always avoid the wreck’s location.
*   Sometimes the wreck is covered by sand and doesn’t present a risk however beach conditions can change in an instant, and in that instant, when the wreck is exposed, it’s decaying shell is sharp and dangerous
*   Often people aren’t aware that the wreck is exposed because it’s submerged under the water.
