Sunshine Coast Council take pride in ensuring Sunshine Coast parks and gardens look green and great.

The recent wet weather has delayed some of council's mowing and maintenance services across the region.

Right now, teams are busy caring for 1183 hectares of parklands and reserves across the Sunshine Coast… that’s equivalent to 1690 football fields!

Council would like to thank the community and visitors for their patience while they catch up. 

If there's enough dry weather, the parks and gardens and other grassed areas will quickly return to tip-top condition.

McArthur Park, Kuluin.

If COVID-19 does impact the workforce, which it may do from time to time, council may need to adjust the service scheduling.

Council would like to assure the community they will prioritise cleaning services and direct resources to urgent and hazardous matters to keep the community safe.

Council appreciates the community is their eyes and ears on the ground, if you see something that needs attention, you can log requests via council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council/Request-for-Service-Online-Form)
.

Alternatively phone 5475 7272 or email customerservice\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

Council thanks you for your patience.
