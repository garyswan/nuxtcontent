From the pristine beach, to the funky coastal shops and bustling markets, Marcoola North is much-loved by both locals and visitors.

That’s why Sunshine Coast Council is looking to protect and enhance what the community enjoys about this coastal pocket.

Council is collaborating with the community and seeking their ideas about the Marcoola North Foreshore Precinct to inspire and shape a new streetscape and park design.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said he was looking forward to working with residents, community groups and businesses to create a shared vision for the area.   

“Understanding community ideas helps our Design and Placemaking team develop a place-based approach where the structures, streetscapes and spaces reflect the values and characteristics of Marcoola and its community,” Cr O’Pray said.  

“This feedback will help inform the masterplan, which will guide future projects including upgrades to the foreshore’s Felix Parry Park and streetscape improvements between the Marcoola Surf Life Saving Club and Lorraine Avenue shops.

“This is an opportunity for our community to be part of Marcoola’s future.

“It’s about improving public spaces to strengthen Marcoola as a destination and encouraging the community and local businesses to invest in events, local shops and to enjoy improved natural assets.

“The project team will be at the Marcoola night markets tonight, so if you’re heading down for some good food, make sure you share your ideas and leave your feedback.”

The community is encouraged to provide feedback by completing a [short survey online](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mnfp)
&#x20;at haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or speaking with a member of the project team before Monday, January 17, 2022.

Placemaking asks the community to be involved in the design and management of public spaces to help understand and improve a “sense of place”, or unique identity for a town.

The masterplan will provide direction on community values to guide future planning and capital works projects, subject to future capital works budget considerations.  

In 2022, council will ask for further feedback on the concept designs asking, ‘Have we got it right?’ on the values and vision for Marcoola. Following this consultation, a masterplan will be produced, and staged construction projects will be scheduled to take place in the following years.
