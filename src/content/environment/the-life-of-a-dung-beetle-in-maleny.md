Ever wondered about the life of the humble dung beetle? They actually have a really important gig of transferring nutrients from dung into the soil.

This October, Kathy Ebert from the University of Queensland, will research the dung beetles that call Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve home during Tiny Giants – a study into Mary’s amazing invertebrates.

**What research will you be doing?**

I am surveying the native dung beetles of Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve, to see how many different kinds of dung beetles live here in this particular patch of remnant rainforest*.*

**Why is it important?**

Dung beetles have the really important job of transferring nutrients from dung and other composting materials into the soil. Their dung burial activities help to improve soil fertility and aeration, as well as reduce parasites. If you’ve got a diverse dung beetle population then you likely have a healthy rainforest and a healthy mammal population.

**What will you do with the research after the event?**

Results from this survey will add to our knowledge of biodiversity for Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve, as well as provide baseline data with which we can monitor changes.

&#x20;for a workshop, talk or walk to discover the rainforest’s Tiny Giants for yourself – October 21–24.
