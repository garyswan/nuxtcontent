Residents and visitors have a stunning new vantage point to take in the sensational views of Mooloolaba Beach down to Point Cartwright.

The first part of the new Northern Parkland in Mooloolaba opened to our community today, November 9, 2021. This includes a new viewing platform at the Alex Bluff Foreshore Park, a beautiful boardwalk and staircase linking the boardwalk to Mooloolaba Esplanade, plus significant embankment revegetation and plantings around a new grass open space.

The new infrastructure is part of the greater Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation project which will increase public beachfront parkland by 40 per cent and include new community spaces and amenities, all of which aim to enhance and celebrate the natural Sunshine Coast way of life.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the platform and boardwalk were fabricated by Caloundra business The Jetty Specialists and constructed by Mooloolaba’s own Murphy Builders with the goal of giving people of all abilities the opportunity to be closer to the stunning coastline.

“I’m excited for our local community and visitors to come and walk along the beautiful new 200 metres long boardwalk,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Both the viewing platform and the boardwalk feature plenty of seating options and sweeping coastal views with space for easy accessibility.

“I believe fitness enthusiasts will also take advantage of a great new 430 metre circuit along the boardwalk, up the staircase to the exercise equipment, and then around Mooloolaba Esplanade to the viewing platform again.

“In addition to the new infrastructure, more than 70 new trees and 10,000 new shrubs and groundcovers will be planted in this first section of the parklands.

“Our teams have worked extensively to remove invasive weeds while preserving native plants and a much-loved Triple Norfolk Pine, which stands at 15 metres tall.

“It’s wonderful to open this section of the Stage 1: Northern Parkland to the public, and I look forward to a grand opening next year when the rest of the parkland is unveiled.”

Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said the $16 million Stage 1: Northern Parkland was a joint project between Sunshine Coast Council and the Queensland Government.

“The Queensland Government has provided funding for this fantastic local project from the State’s Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package for South East Queensland.

“We’re delivering on our promise to help local councils deliver projects that stimulate employment, boost local economies and improve communities.

“What a way to contribute to this growing region, by not only creating local jobs, but also by creating such a beautiful community asset for all to enjoy.”

Ahead of the rest of the parkland opening in 2022, Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli was excited to share news that a state-of-the-art playground was in the works.

“I’m absolutely thrilled to see this beautiful new viewing platform and boardwalk open to our community, but one of the pieces of community infrastructure I’m most looking forward to is the new adventure playground,” Cr Natoli said.

“This will be the most significant playground council has delivered and it’s a one-of-a-kind design especially created for our Mooloolaba Foreshore.

“The adventure playground will be positioned at the southern section of the Stage 1: Northern Park area, between a new sheltered barbecue area and the coastal pathway.

“The three main play elements will be a climbing net, an adventure play tower and an extended swing set, which will have active and inclusive play elements for all to enjoy.

“There will be something for everyone at this exciting new playground, and it will cater to a wide range of ages and abilities.”

The adventure playground is now being constructed along with a new public amenity, sheltered barbecue area and an accessible path that will link the new boardwalk to Mooloolaba.

Council and contractors are working to complete the remaining sections within Stage 1: Northern Parkland, with some elements aiming to become available early in 2022 and others shortly afterwards, weather and site conditions permitting.

The Queensland Government has invested $4.6 million into the project through the $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package for South East Queensland councils to stimulate economies and support jobs. Council has committed $11.5 million towards Stage One and is proud to partner with local firms to deliver this new parkland.
