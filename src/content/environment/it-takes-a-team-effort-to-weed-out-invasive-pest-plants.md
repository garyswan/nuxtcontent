The fight against invasive weeds continues, thanks to a renewed partnership between Sunshine Coast Council and private landowners.

Council’s Biosecurity Surveillance Program offers support to rural property owners, teaching them how best to manage pest plants on their land.

It will also continue to proactively monitor the extent of invasive pest plants across the region, including groundsel bush, cat’s claw creeper, fireweed, giant rat’s tail grasses and salvinia.

Council’s Liveability and Environment Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said proactively managing invasive pest plants required a team effort.

“Invasive pest plants reduce biodiversity, compete with beneficial pasture species, impact farm productivity, and destroy native wildlife habitat,” Cr Cox said.

“This program focuses on educating and empowering landholders to understand those risks and manage invasive plants on their property.

“This is done through one-on-one training, advice, and on-the-ground support for property owners.

“We also partner with non-government organisations to share educational material and hold education stalls at community events.

“In addition to the educational aspect of the Biosecurity Surveillance Program, landholders also have access to equipment to help them manage invasive plants on their property to assist them meet their legal obligations.

“Last year’s survey program found that 17 per cent of the properties that were proactively inspected required ongoing support to reduce invasive weeds.

“Fighting invasive plants is a council-community partnership and landholder support, from both private and publicly owned property, is critical to the program’s success.”

The program was renewed until September 11, 2025 at today’s (25 August) Ordinary Meeting of council.

During the 3-year program, council will continue inspecting private or public properties equal to or greater than 4000m2 within the Sunshine Coast Local Government Area.

The program will start in the upper catchment suburbs of Balmoral Ridge, Diamond Valley, Beerwah, Bells Creek, Crohamhurst, North Maleny, Flaxton, Dulong, Eerwah Vale, Verrierdale, Belli Park, Peachester, Montville, Obi Obi and Mapleton, Doonan, Eumundi, Kureelpa, Maleny, Mt Mellum and Reesville. 

Properties previously known to harbour invasive plants may also be surveyed for ongoing compliance.

Under the *Biosecurity Act 2014*, landholders must manage certain invasive pest plants on land that is under their control.
