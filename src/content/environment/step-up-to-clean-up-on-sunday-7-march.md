On Sunday March 7, 2021, our community is encouraged to join a Sunshine Coast Clean Up Australia Day event, by registering for one of 29 public clean-up sites in hinterland and beachside parks and waterways across the region.

Registration is easy. Simply visit [cleanupaustraliaday.org.au](https://www.cleanupaustraliaday.org.au/join-a-clean-up)
, select ‘join a clean up’ and search for an event nearby by entering your postcode or suburb.

Service Delivery Portfolio Holder Cr Winston Johnston said Sunshine Coast Council was proud to recognise, raise awareness for, and support the many amazing groups and individuals who lead our region’s clean-up activities, both on Clean Up Australia Day and throughout the year.

“Council proudly supports the event through the Waste 2 Resource program, assisting groups to organise their events, as well as providing free collection and disposal of all clean up waste,” Cr Johnston said.

“Last year, 1275 Sunshine Coast residents pitched in to do their part for the clean-up, across 106 sites (private and public groups), collecting more than 10 tonnes of waste and recycling 700 kilograms of waste.”

In 2020, many regular groups commented on the impact of the Containers for Change program with a lower number of takeaway drink bottles noted in the litter collected.

Almost all beach site groups reported collecting small soft plastic food packages and cigarette butts, while several also reported they had to remove ‘camp’ or ‘party’ sites in the dunes.

While feedback from regular sites located in more publicly used areas such as main beaches, rivers and parks reported much less rubbish, sites located in more remote areas of the region reported the continued presence of illegal dumping with tyres and furniture commonly reported.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox encouraged people to find a local site to help clean up.

“Together, we can help protect our local waterways, beaches and hinterland environments from litter and marine debris,” Cr Cox said.

“Nature is an important part of our lifestyle here on the Sunshine Coast and we need to look after our environment to make sure we keep this quality of life.

“Events like Clean Up Australia Day help to raise awareness about the importance of conserving and protecting our environment from the impacts of litter.”

Cr Johnston encouraged the community to make everyday a clean-up day.

“Whenever people are out in our beautiful environment, we encourage them to please safely pick up any litter they see. Even just one piece can make a difference. After all, a Clean Sunshine Coast is in our hands.”
