Sunshine Coast Council has taken out top gong for a range of projects at the IPWEA Queensland awards this week. 

The award program places a spotlight n the projects and people who deliver exceptional outcomes for Queensland communities.

Congratulations to the project officers and branches involved in taking Sunshine Coast Council’s vision one step further to be Australia’s most sustainable region – Healthy. Smart. Creative. 

Mooloolaba’s Amarina Avenue stormwater renewal received the Excellence Award for projects valued under $1 million.

The innovative project was delivered in partnership with Interflow to renew a major box culvert asset that had reached the end of its service life.

The project was a region first ‘relining’ of box culverts with a custom-built, glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) liner, designed to carry all loadings. The project was a region first ‘relining’ for box culverts and proactively addressed the region’s stormwater needs.

The Excellence Award for best project between $1-2 million and a High Commendation for Coastal Engineering went to Maroochy Groyne Renewal Project.

This environmentally sensitive project used more than 2,000 nine tonne sand-filled geotextile containers to renew two groyne structures and a seawall.

The complex project now protects the iconic waterfront #CottonTree Holiday Park, valuable recreation areas, businesses, accommodation and residential properties, from erosion.
