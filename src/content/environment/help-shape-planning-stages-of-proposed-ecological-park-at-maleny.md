As planning progresses for the proposed Sunshine Coast ecological park, Sunshine Coast Council is now calling for community input on a draft concept of the project.

Following the project’s [first round of community consultation in May](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Ecological-Park)
, Sunshine Coast Council is inviting residents and visitors to have their say on the draft concept, and indicate which features they’d like to see in the proposed new park via an interactive map.

The ecological park aligns with council’s commitment to nurture and grow its green spaces and is located across 65 hectares of council-acquired land, adjacent to Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve in Maleny.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Cr Cox said the second stage of community consultation would build on earlier feedback and was an opportunity to further share, test and provide feedback on proposed ideas to help inform a draft master plan.

“The proposed Sunshine Coast Ecological Park will be the first of its kind for our community and a wonderful place for recreation and wellness, ecology and restoration, plus research, education and culture,” Cr Cox said.  

“To ensure the project delivers the desired mix of recreation, green space and ecological conservation, this next stage of engagement will help us understand which features are a priority for our community and stakeholders.

“Our first stage of community consultation demonstrated strong support for the ecological park to create new habitat for wildlife, and incorporate the stories, history and values of the Jinibara peoples, the traditional custodians of the land.

“There were also fantastic insights around the need to consider accessibility and connectivity, and incorporate designated areas for recreation and nature play.

“In line with our [Environment and Liveability Strategy 2017](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, the proposed ecological park is a unique opportunity to enhance our conservation and recreation credentials for the entire Sunshine Coast community and visitors to enjoy.

“An [Excellence Advisory Panel and Community Reference Group](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Ecological-Park)
&#x20;have been established to help inform the development of a master plan and continue to provide feedback throughout all stages of the master planning process. 

“Council is also working alongside Traditional Custodians to understand the cultural and traditional heritage of the site and respectfully integrate history into the design of the park.

“I’d like to thank everyone who has so far taken the time to share their views on the project.

“People can provide feedback on the draft concept until September 14, either online or by chatting to the project team at one of the [pop-up events](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sc-eco-park-master-plan)
.

“The Sunshine Coast ecological park will be a beautiful place for both Sunshine Coast locals and visitors, so we’d like to hear from everyone.”
