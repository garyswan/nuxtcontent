Sunshine Coast Council’s proactive plan to deliver a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast by 2041 has been announced the winner of the 2020 Banksia Government Awards.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS) provided our long-term strategic directions to guide growth and shape the sustainability of the Sunshine Coast for future generations.  

“The Banksia Sustainability Awards are the longest-running sustainability awards globally and are regarded as the most prestigious of their kind in Australia, so we are really proud to be recognised at this level,” Mayor Jamieson said. 

“Clearly our council is delivering a substantial environmental legacy for the Sunshine Coast, with this being recognised through council receiving this sustainability award for two consecutive years, coming on the back of the Mary Cairncross BioBlitz in 2019.

“Our council is working with our community on some ground-breaking, significant projects that will preserve the natural environment, ecosystems and liveability of our Sunshine Coast.

“From our Australian-first, large scale blue carbon initiative – Blue Heart Sunshine Coast – to our work on Coastal Hazard Adaptation and managing the largest council owned conservation estate in south east Queensland. 

“Our commitment to our environment is extensive and enduring – and we are proud to be nation leaders in this important policy area.

“I’d also like to acknowledge the role of our Sunshine Coast Council staff who have played a critical role in developing and implementing our Environment and Liveability Strategy.

“We are fortunate to have such an innovative and committed team of people working hard to strengthen and maintain our environmental credentials.

“Our council holds the Banksia Government Awards in great esteem and this recognition provides a great inspiration to continue doing the work to achieve our vision, Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.”

Together with the Regional Economic Development Strategy and our Community Strategy, the ELS provides a comprehensive policy framework to guide and shape the future of our Sunshine Coast.
