Sunshine Coast Council maintains over 350 playgrounds across the region and vegetation and trees play an important role in providing shade to many of these playgrounds.

Moffat Beach park’s beloved Moreton Bay fig tree provides an iconic shade canopy to the popular playground situated along the beach front.

Several years ago, it was discovered the fig tree was infected with a soil borne disease. The condition is caused by fungal pathogens attacking tree roots causing decay.

Watch as Sunshine Coast Council Arborists explain how council have been rehabilitating the iconic fig tree.

Sunshine Coast Council Manager, Parks and Gardens, Nicholas Coluccio said trees are a very important element of our ecology and provide great habitat along with cooling our urban areas through shade. 

“Council’s team of arborists have been dedicated to rehabilitating the tree by treating the tree and improving the soil conditions with a microbial compost liquid brew,” Mr. Coluccio said.

“Through ongoing management, our team will continue to closely monitor the condition of the tree including assessing safety impacts to the community.

“We’re proud to say the iconic fig tree is currently in a good condition and it is hoped the community can continue to enjoy this tree for years to come.”
