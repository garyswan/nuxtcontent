Volunteers do so much for our Sunshine Coast and 300 of them, including nine children, recently planted 400 native trees in a degraded section of Isambert Rd Environment Reserve at Landsborough.

This included 300 food trees (Allocasuarina littoralis & Allocasuarina torulosa) for the Glossy Black Cockatoo - a very unique, yet unfortunately threatened species of cockatoo that calls the Sunshine Coast home.

Council originally purchased the property using the environment levy and has been working to restore the reserve back to it's natural healthy self.

The volunteers were also given a tour of the site so they could learn about the location's history and how their efforts have contributed to the ecological restoration of the site.

This work helps to place this degraded section of the reserve on a trajectory returning to natural, native bushland in the future.
