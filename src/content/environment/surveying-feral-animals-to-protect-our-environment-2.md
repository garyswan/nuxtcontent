Sunshine Coast Council will conduct routine night-time feral animal surveying at Kenilworth, Conondale and Cambroon between Monday, April 11, and Wednesday, April 13.

Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said surveying was used to determine the distribution, population, size, habitat use and impacts of feral animals.

“It’s important to monitor where feral animals are located and understand the extent of them in the region so activities can be implemented to minimise their impact on our environment and our community,” Cr Suarez said.

“Data collected from these surveys is used to inform and assess the effectiveness of council’s feral animal control programs and to assist with targeting problem areas.”

Feral animal impacts include damage to agricultural and horticultural crops, irrigation and fences, competition with livestock for pasture and supplementary feed, attacks on livestock, domestic pets and native animals, damage to trees and native regeneration, the dispersal of weed seeds and erosion.

Some survey results are shared with research organisations, universities and other areas of government across the country, and form the basis for further research, programs and investigations.

The survey is conducted from council roads and reserves and does not require officers to enter private property.

The work will be performed using thermal imaging equipment mounted to a council vehicle. No spotlights are used.

Surveying will be conducted in the following locations:

*   Walli Creek Rd/Walli Mountain Rd, Kenilworth
*   Aherns Rd, Conondale
*   Kilcoy Lane – Broken Bridge Rd, Conondale
*   Eastern Mary River Rd, Cambroon
*   Booloumba Creek Rd, Cambroon

Please report sightings of feral animals in your area to council. Council officers are available to assist with education and action for landowners to minimise the impact of feral animals on their property.
