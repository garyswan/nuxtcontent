You are invited to be part of the first Australia wide "Great Glossy Count" on Saturday March 26 to [count Glossy Blacks](https://glossyblack.org.au/great-glossy-count/)
&#x20;on the Sunshine Coast.

Get your identification skills up to scratch and learn how to recognise this charismatic bird at a free workshop on Tuesday 16 March.

BirdLife Australia and the Glossy Black Conservancy are hosting Australia’s first Great Glossy Count and calling for 500 citizen scientists are needed to collect data to support vital bushfire recovery and conservation work for the South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo.

The South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo is at risk of population decline after losing feed trees in the devastating bushfires of 2019-2020.

Data collected during the Great Glossy Count will support vital bushfire recovery and conservation work by informing habitat management for these birds.

Volunteer citizen scientists are being recruited to collect data on the South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo and its feed trees across its range in Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, and Victoria.

When you register as a volunteer you’ll receive information about how to participate in the Great Glossy Count and you’ll have the opportunity to attend a free workshop and access new resources about identifying Glossy Black-Cockatoos.

This project is funded by BirdLife Australia's supporters and a grant awarded under the Australian Government’s Regional Bushfire Recovery for Multiregional Species and Strategic Projects Program.
