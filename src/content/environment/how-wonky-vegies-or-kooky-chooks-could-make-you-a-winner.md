Think you have the best home veggie patch around? How about the wonkiest vegetable, or the best chicken name?

Sunshine Coast growers in the backyard, school patch or community garden have the chance to impress the nation, as entries open for the annual Grow It Local Awards.

Judges include Gardening Australia’s Costa Georgiadis, and winners from each category will be awarded prize packs of gardening supplies, along with a bumper crop of bragging rights.

Supported by Sunshine Coast Council’s Living Smart Program, the Grow It Local initiative aims to bring fun and creativity to food growing, with the awards featuring quirky categories to engage growers of all means and expertise.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said more than 560 members were registered in the Grow It Local community.

Cr Suarez said this showed a rapid uptake since Council first partnered with Grow It Local in 2022.

“Growing food at home, schools or community gardens is a fantastic way to foster a connection to nature and healthy lifestyles, and an easy step for residents to live more sustainably within our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.

“Council’s partnership with Grow It Local aims to empower everyone to access skills, knowledge and inspiration to grow food, whether in a backyard, balcony, kitchen or shared garden.”
