A small section of North Shore Beach will be closed to all people and dogs between the hours of 7am to 5pm, Monday to Friday from 8 February 2021 to mid-March.

This is to provide a refuge for migratory shorebirds while Sunshine Coast Council pumps sand from the Maroochy River back onto Maroochydore Beach to renourish the coastline after recent storm-related erosion.

The beach and dog off-leash area to the north of this exclusion zone will remain open during this time.

Signage and regular patrols will be in place to advise beach goers of the temporary exclusion zone.

This is a requirement as part of the Australian Government’s [environmental permit conditions](https://developmenti.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Home/FilterDirect?filters=DANumber=OPW17/0114)
. The last time this section of beach was closed was in 2016 for the same reason.

Council apologises in advance for any inconvenience.
