A plan to create a haven for two vulnerable-listed frog species has begun, with work underway on 20 new breeding ponds along the Lower Mooloolah River, Palmview.

Sunshine Coast Council is rehabilitating approximately 60 hectares of former pastureland.

This includes planting around 90,000 native shrubs and trees and building more homes for wildlife through habitat stacks so acid frog species – [Wallum Froglet (*Crinia tinnula*)](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species-search/details/?id=686)
&#x20;and [Wallum Rocketfrog (*Litoria freycineti*)](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species-search/details/?id=609)
&#x20;– can thrive in the right conditions.

The project is part of council’s ongoing commitment to restore the [Lower Mooloolah River Green Space](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/About-the-strategy/Transformational-actions/Expanding-the-green-space)
&#x20;– one of five major green spaces in addition to Mountain View, the Regional Inter-urban Break, Blue Heart Sunshine Coast and the Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Acting Group Executive for Liveability and Natural Assets Bill Haddrill said the Lower Mooloolah River was 200 hectares of important green space running through the centre of the region.

“We aim to protect and enhance the Lower Mooloolah River green space for the open space, conservation, rural landscape and flood storage values,” Mr Haddrill said.

“This particular project includes both assisted regeneration and habitat construction work to attract acid frog species into specific areas of the environment reserve.

“We know the vulnerable frog species have been identified in the area in smaller numbers.

“The goal is to create the right acidic conditions to create an optimal breeding environment, so the frog populations increase.

“To do this, we need the right mix of native plant species, soil conditions and water levels – similar to what might have been there before the reserve was cleared for cattle grazing in 1958.

“Twenty breeding ponds, each about 50 metres by 50 metres, will be constructed under the guidance of expert ecologists.

“Council worked with Kabi Kabi Traditional Owners to ensure the ponds were positioned outside areas of cultural significance.” 

An access track is also being built to assist with construction and ongoing management of the reserve, and to provide access in the event of a fire.

Since grazing in the reserve was stopped in 2018, some vegetation and weeds have regrown naturally.

However, some of this regrowth has been removed to allow for the ponds to be built and help create the right ecosystem so the frogs can thrive.

No large trees have been removed.

This project is being delivered as an [environmental offset for the Sunshine Coast Airport Expansion Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Airport-Expansion-Project/Environmental-approvals-and-management)
.

Offsets are required for the airport project under a Controlled Activity Permit in accordance with the Federal *Environmental Protection and Biodiversity and Conservation Act* and the State Environmental Authority (EA) BRID0035 in Accordance with the *Environmental Protection Act of Queensland.*

Sunshine Coast Council has all the necessary approvals required for the offset project to proceed.
