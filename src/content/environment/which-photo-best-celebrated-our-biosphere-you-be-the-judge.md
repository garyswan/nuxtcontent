Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere is a special place where we are living, working, learning and playing sustainably.

In celebration of International Day for Biosphere Reserves (November 3), Sunshine Coast Council has revealed the finalist images in the inaugural Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere Photography Showcase and now it’s our community’s chance to be a judge in the popular initiative.

Celebrating International Day for Biosphere Reserves, Mayors message.

[Voting](https://www.livingsmartqld.com.au/sunshine-coast-biosphere-2022-photo-exhibition/)
&#x20;is now open and voters will have the chance to win a family pass at a [Saltwater Ecotours](https://www.saltwaterecotours.com.au/saltwaterculturaltour)
&#x20;cruise on the beautiful Mooloolah River with a magical Cultural Tour experience (valued at $299\*).

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said the Sunshine Coast Biosphere Photography Showcase provided a memorable time capsule of our environment and communities within our Sunshine Coast region.

“I congratulate the finalists for these stunning images which offer an invaluable insight into how our residents connect with our environment and each other,” Cr Suarez said.

“Residents submitted creative photographs which showed their connection to living in our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.

“The photographs are a delight for the eyes and feature colourful birds, stunning landscapes and a strong lifestyle connection with our waterways, beaches and our community.”

Cr Suarez said this was especially exciting given our local government area was first recognised internationally by [UNESCO](https://oursc.com.au/featured/sunshine-coast-officially-becomes-a-unesco-biosphere)
&#x20;as a site of excellence this year.

“November 3, 2022 will be the first [International Day for Biosphere Reserves](https://events.unesco.org/event?id=2970790209&lang=1033)
, which is a global event showcasing the contribution biosphere reserves make to sustainable development.

“The Sunshine Coast Biosphere will be joining Australia’s four other biosphere reserves also celebrating this special day – Great Sandy and Noosa in Queensland; Western Port in Victoria; and Fitzgerald in Western Australia.

“The collaboration of biospheres at a national and international level provides opportunities to partner and develop local solutions to global environmental, social and economic challenges.” 

The stunning creative talent of the category winners will be on display from November 7 to 27 at the Maroochydore Bushland Botanic Gardens Arts and Ecology Centre, Tanawha.

Entries came from far and wide including Beerwah, the Glasshouse Mountain, the Pumicestone Passage, Caloundra, Peregian Springs, and Kenilworth, with 291 photos submitted across a broad range of ages and photographic abilities.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said it was a joy to see the energy and creativity in the images.

“The fact some of these images are from novices is extraordinary and I know the judges had a difficult task selecting the finalists from such a vibrant collection,” Cr Cox said.

“I recommend taking the time to visit the exhibition and enjoy the depth and character these photographs bring in highlighting the beauty of our Sunshine Coast Biosphere.”

Our Sunshine Coast Biosphere Photography Showcase category winners will be announced at a special launch event on November 7, with the People’s Choice prize announced on November 30.
