Sunshine Coast Council is reminding residents and visitors to the region that illegal dumping is an offence and penalties apply for those who do the wrong thing.

Earlier this year, illegal dumping officers were successful in identifying the owner of household waste dumped on Godfreys Rd in Bli Bli. The waste was subsequently removed by this person who was fined $2205.

Sunshine Coast Council Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said it was disappointing to see this activity occurring in our region.

“People are dumping household domestic waste in a public place; waste that could easily be disposed of via the weekly household bin collection service,” Cr Dickson said.

“The Sunshine Coast community values our environment and we must ensure that it stays beautiful.

“Dumping waste, rather than disposing of it in the correct way, is illegal and unsightly and can be harmful to our environment and wildlife. 

“There are many affordable and easy ways to correctly [dispose](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Illegal-dumping)
&#x20;of waste on the Sunshine Coast and the majority of locals and visitors do the right thing. However a small number of people are spoiling our public and natural areas.

“There is no need for illegal dumping as many domestic items, including whitegoods and electronic equipment, can be disposed of at council’s resource recovery centres at no charge.”

Council’s illegal dumping officers use a variety of methods to investigate incidents and identify offenders.

The community can report illegal dumping in the Sunshine Coast area via [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Illegal-dumping)
&#x20;or email the location and type of waste to mail\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.
