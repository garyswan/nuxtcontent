There's now more space for boating activities at the Cod Hole Boat Ramp at Bradman Avenue.

Thanks to our community for their patience while we upgraded this popular watercraft launching spot on the Maroochy River.

The car park area was extended for more space when reversing trailers onto the boat ramp, changes were made to the pavement to better cope with sea level rise and the revetment wall was rebuilt to protect the area from future floods.

Itâ€™s now open and ready for your boating pleasure.
