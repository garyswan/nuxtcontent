Hardworking TurtleCare and Coolum and North Shore Coast Care citizen scientist volunteers worked tirelessly through Tropical Cyclone Seth to secure, protect and relocate turtle nests across the coastline.

Pictured here are trained and authorised citizen scientists from TurtleCare relocating clutches of eggs, or securing tarpaulins over nests that were at a critical period of incubation (less than 21 days) and therefore were best not to be moved.

At 21 days the tiny developing turtle embryos are robust enough to withstand some movement.

Sunshine Coast Council's trained TurtleCare citizen science volunteers relocated 17 nests during the extreme weather of TC Seth, no clutches of eggs were lost to the erosion banks.

If you see any tracks, nests or uncovered nests during the ongoing weather, please report it to volunteers at TurtleCare or the Coolum and North Shore Coast Care.

For sightings on the southern end of the coast call 0437 559 067 and for sightings from Mooloolaba north call Coolum and North Shore Coast Care on 0478 435 377.

All TurtleCare activities are conducted under Queensland Turtle Conservation Project permits.
