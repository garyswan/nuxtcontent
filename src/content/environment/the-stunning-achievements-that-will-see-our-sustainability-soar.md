The Sunshine Coast has welcomed “several incredible initiatives’’ that will protect the region’s precious environment and help it retain its enviable lifestyle.

Sunshine Coast Council on Wednesday (September 21) released its Environment and Liveability Strategy Annual Report 2021/22, highlighting the organisation’s progress in creating Australia’s most sustainable region.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the report provided a comprehensive overview of council’s leadership and actions contributing towards a sustainable Sunshine Coast.

“During the 2021/22 financial year, we continued to stay true to our vision and delivered several incredible initiatives,’’ Mayor Jamieson said.

“The biggest of these was our international recognition as a [UNESCO Biosphere Reserve](https://oursc.com.au/featured/sunshine-coast-officially-becomes-a-unesco-biosphere)
&#x20;achieved in conjunction with our community.

“From being recognised internationally as a biosphere, to strategic environment land acquisitions, planning for recreational outcomes, and developing pathways to respond efficiently and innovatively to a changing climate, the implementation of council’s award-winning [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Explore-by-theme/Sustainable-living)
&#x20;is extensive.

“As we preserve, protect and enhance our natural environment, council also continued its delivery of the [Environment Levy Program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Environment-Levy)
&#x20;and our commitment to grow our green spaces.

“In total, we delivered a $13.17 million Environment Levy Program, supporting the acquisition of more than 165.5 hectares of new land for conservation purposes, as well as on-ground activities, research, and community partnerships.”

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said a number of initiatives delivered in 2021/2022 demonstrated council’s commitment to enhancing our recreational opportunities.

“In line with the strategy, council endorsed the [Recreation Parks Plan](https://oursc.com.au/community/green-step-forward-for-sunshine-coast-parks)
&#x20;which outlines the strategic direction for parks across the region until 2031, supporting the delivery of even better experiences for our community,” Cr Suarez said.

“As another outcome, council recognised that we are in a [state of climate emergency](https://oursc.com.au/council-news/council-recognises-state-of-climate-emergency)
&#x20;that requires urgent and sustained effort to achieve net zero emissions by 2041.

“As part of our ongoing climate change response, council progressed the development of a Regional Climate Action Roadmap to identify paths forward to address climate risk and to build our collective capacity to respond efficiently and innovatively to a changing climate.”

Fellow Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said the report showcased council’s environmental sustainability performance, including its carbon emissions.

“Becoming a zero-net emissions organisation by 2041 is a Transformational Action of the Strategy,” said Cr Cox.

“Tracking our progress towards this target is important to understand our effectiveness in reducing these emissions and the adjustments and further investments may be required.

“The Environment and Liveability Strategy is now in its fifth year and continues to provide the long-term strategic directions to guide growth, environmental protection and shaped the region for future generations.”
