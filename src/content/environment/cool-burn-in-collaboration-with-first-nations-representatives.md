Sunshine Coast Council's Fire Management Team and Kabi Kabi and Jinibara representatives completed the first cool burn of the season at East Mount Mellum Nature Refuge last week.

The last burn on this site was 11 years ago, and this burn was timed to meet the recommended fire regime for this ecosystem type.

The low to moderate intensity fire in steep country helped to reduce the risk of unplanned bushfire to the community and the environment.

As planned, unburnt gully vegetation acted as a refuge for animals and achieved a mosaic pattern of burnt and unburnt areas within the burn area.

Large habitat trees were protected across the site.

Thank you to the Landsborough Rural Fire Brigade who did an outstanding job on the private property areas of the burn, assisting council staff late into the night.

Local First Nations representation from the Kabi Kabi and Jinibara peoples were greatly appreciated during the burn and pre-burn habitat tree protection activities.

Surrounding landholders expressed their appreciation for the burn, and commented on the professionalism of the fire crews.
