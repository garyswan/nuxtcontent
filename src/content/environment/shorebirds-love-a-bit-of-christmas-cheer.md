‘Tis the season – to put on weight! Migratory shorebirds have now recovered from their long migration to Australia. But not long until they do it all over again, so it’s time for them to start putting on some weight. Migratory shorebirds more than double their body weight before their return migration to the northern hemisphere. Help them fattening up by sharing our shore and keeping your distance.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
