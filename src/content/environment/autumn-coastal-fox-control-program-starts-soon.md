As the Sunshine Coast transitions to cooler weather, the Coastal Fox Control Program will soon start to protect our native wildlife from the predatory fox in coastal bushland areas from Mudjimba to Peregian Springs.

Sunshine Coast Council, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Coolum and Northshore Coast Care and Noosa Council will work together to deliver the program between April 20 and May 27.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the program played an important part in protecting our endangered and threatened species and had delivered very positive results since the program started in 2015.  

“Areas included in the control program will be clearly identified, with warning signs at all entrances,” Cr Suarez said.

“Please ensure your pets do not roam into bushland area during this period.

“We appreciate the support the community continues to give this program as we hope to reduce the impacts these introduced predators have on our native coastal wildlife species.

“A fox can have a huge impact on turtle hatchlings. Foxes dig up turtle nests and harass female turtles that come up to lay, leading to poor reproductive rates of the already endangered green and loggerhead turtles that nest on Sunshine Coast beaches.”

The program is designed to impact fox populations at a time when they were particularly active and reduce fox predation on vulnerable populations of native species, such as water mice, Eastern ground parrots, and endangered green and loggerhead turtles at the egg and hatchling stage.

More information about the program is available on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Invasive-plants-and-animals/Invasive-animals/Managing-Invasive-Animals/What-council-is-doing/Coastal-fox-control-program)
.

The European red fox is a restricted invasive species under the Queensland Government *Biosecurity Act 2014*.

Under the *Biosecurity Act 2014,* all landowners have a General Biosecurity Obligation (GBO) to manage biosecurity matter and invasive species on their property. Sunshine Coast Council is assisting landowners with this across the region

If you spot a suspected fox den in the program area, report it to council on 5475 7272. You can also view the fact sheet to [learn how to identify a fox den](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Invasive-plants-and-animals/Invasive-animals/Invasive-animals-of-our-region/Priority-Invasive-Animals/Fox)
