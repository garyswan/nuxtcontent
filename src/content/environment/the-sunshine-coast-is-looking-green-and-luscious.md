Sunshine Coast Council would like to extend its gratitude to the community as we experience some mowing and maintenance delays across our region due to the recent wet weather which creates the perfect growing conditions for grass.

While the kangaroos and grasshoppers are very happy with the situation, we understand your frustrations.

Consistent rainfall has been our biggest challenge where sites can be too wet for our heavy mowers to access without doing considerable damage.

If we leave areas to dry out, it only compounds the problem as the grass continues to grow and often when areas are rescheduled for mowing further rainfall is experienced which leaves some sites within our region inaccessible for weeks.

**DID YOU KNOW?**

It's rained 41 days out of 74 at Coolum. Persistent rainfall tallies have been extremely high with 20 rain days for the month of January.

Right now, our teams are busy caring for our 1183 hectares of parklands and reserves across the Sunshine Coast region which is equivalent to 1690 football fields.

COVID-19 may impact our workforce numbers, from time to time, so we will continue to adjust our service scheduling. We assure you we will prioritise our cleaning services and direct resources to urgent and hazardous matters to keep our community safe.

Thank you again to our residents and visitors while we work around the La Ni√±a.
