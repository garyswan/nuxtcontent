[Sunshine Coast Council’s Construction Management and Waterway Protection Taskforce](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Rivers-and-Coast/Erosion-and-Sediment-Control)
&#x20;team has identified preserving and improving the values of the Pumicestone Passage and its catchment as top priority.

It comes as the region experienced significant rainfall during the recent severe weather event that drenched south east Queensland earlier this month.

Funded through [Council’s Environment Levy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Environment-Levy)
, the special council team is part of a dedicated program featuring waterway protection officers and an environment officer to help improve our environment and waterways.

Its focus is on achieving best practice in construction management and erosion and sediment control by reducing sediments entering our waterways.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said whether it was for boating, paddling, fishing or swimming – residents and visitors loved to enjoy our Sunshine Coast’s waterways and wetlands.

“It’s clear that our diverse waterways, such as Pumicestone Passage, Mooloolah River and Maroochy River, are already highly valued and enjoyed by our community, but we all have a role to play in keeping them ecologically healthy,” Cr Suarez said.

“Council is dedicated to the ongoing protection and management of our waterways and catchments, both for their environmental value and the liveability of our beautiful region.

“Through the [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, council is continuing to invest in major environmental management programs that support catchment and waterway health, to ensure the Sunshine Coast’s natural assets are preserved and enhanced.

“Over the next three years council has committed to this special team to focus on a comprehensive education and regulatory approach across all parts of the construction section from residential builders through to contractors and developers.

“Waterway health can vary from year to year as a result of environmental conditions such as rainfall, which affects the levels of pollutants that enter our waterways.

“However, waterway pollution from development or construction sites is easily preventable by having the right control measures in place for erosion and sediment.

“Everyone has a responsibility to maintain and manage sediment and waste entering our waterways to ensure their ongoing protection.”

[Council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Environment-Levy)
&#x20;has a target to achieve consistently good to excellent grades across all our river catchments by 2041.
