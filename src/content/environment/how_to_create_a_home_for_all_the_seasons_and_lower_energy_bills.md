Here’s a great chance to tap into inspiring tips from Sunshine Coast design experts and learn how to make your home comfortable all year round.

Sunshine Coast Council has developed a free educational [design booklet](https://web-a-e-prod-marketing.azurewebsites.net/CoolHomes/)
, [online course](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/environment/sustainability-and-climate-change/sunshine-coast-design/freeonlinecourse)
&#x20;and [smart phone compass](https://propertycompass.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;to help you better understand our local sub-tropical climate and how the sun in winter and summer influences the liveability of our homes.

Implementing even a few of the tips will make a difference to how your home feels, improve comfort levels and help lower energy bills.

Owners are advised to consider the location of rooms, create and merge indoor and outdoor living spaces, look to achieve more air flow, choose the right building materials, use sunlight to illuminate interiors and shape gardens and trees for shade.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said he encouraged locals looking to build, buy or renovate to read the [Cool Homes for the Sunshine Coast booklet](https://web-a-e-prod-marketing.azurewebsites.net/CoolHomes/)
, to help make smarter design decisions.

“Now is the time to think about the forecasted dry and hot summer season that lies ahead, as good design can help you save on cooling costs,” Cr Dickson said.

“We also have the ability to enjoy an indoor and outdoor lifestyle – especially if we have a home designed to make the most of our weather.

“Living on the Sunshine Coast is, of course, very different to living down south and there is a lot we can do to make our homes more comfortable for the different seasons.”

## Understanding the Sunshine Coast climate

The Sunshine Coast enjoys a sub-tropical climate that is hot and humid in summer, and mostly cool and mild in winter. Whether your home is on the coast or in the hinterland, you can enjoy a healthy and comfortable indoor/outdoor lifestyle all year round.

A thoughtfully designed home will work with the climate - it will keep the heat out in summer and the cold out during winter. It will allow the warming sun into your home when it’s cold and cooling breezes to flow through your home during the hotter months.

## Don’t delay - it’s heating up!

Even though the Sunshine Coast has one of the most liveable climates in the world, it is not immune to the warming impact of climate change. The number of very hot and humid days is on the rise.

Make smart decisions now about what to buy, or how to create a comfortable home for you and your loved ones into the future.
