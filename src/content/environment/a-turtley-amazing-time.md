Did you know that turtle nesting season is here?

From November to May, look out for turtle tracks, new nests and emerging hatchlings.

If you see signs of turtles on our beaches, please watch your step and contact the ‘Turtle Care’ volunteers via Sunshine Coast Council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Native-Animals/TurtleCare)
.

These volunteers survey our beaches daily to help monitor these beautiful creatures.

If you want to help the turtles, switch off your outside lights from 8pm.
