Living on the Sunshine Coast for the past five years has inspired a love in me for our beautiful landscapes and incredible ocean life.

It motivated me to write a children’s book “Trevy’s tricky day” to promote environmental care by increasing awareness and educating young children.

Being an early childhood teacher for the past 18 years I have identified a need for more child friendly resources that educate children about protecting our local wildlife and environment.

“Trevy’s tricky day” is available with a gorgeous turtle plush toy and reusable bag to take home and enjoy. Or it can be used in early childhood settings as a teaching resource.

Over the past three years I have had great success using this resource in my classroom as a take home pet with a twist.

The families welcome Trevy into their homes, read with their children and show him how they are caring for the environment.

The photos that are sent back to the classroom encourage discussions about respect and are extended on with fun activities for the children.

Parents have given positive feedback about how the book and pack have made them more aware of their practices at home and have started meaningful conversations around sustainability.

I hope to continue following my passion through books, resources and social media.

Using social media has allowed me to support local community programs and network with others with similar interests around our country.

I am very appreciated of the support from our community in promoting my book.
