Stormwater management is about protecting our waterways from pollutants and increased and concentrated flows, using rainwater and stormwater as a resource and ensuring homes and infrastructure are not flooded during storm events.

Here are a few ways you can help contribute to a more sustainable Sunshine Coast:

*   wash vehicles on grassed areas or at designated car washes
*   participate in local environmental groups and clean-up events
*   pick up litter when safe to do so
*   dispose of litter, chemicals and animal waste responsibly
*   avoid stormwater hazards
*   notify Council of problems and potential hazards
*   HAVE YOUR SAY on the Draft Stormwater Management Strategy!

The Draft Stormwater Management Strategy aims to identify existing and future issues and outlines ways they can be addressed.

Visit [Councilâ€™s website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stormwater-management-strategy-sms)
&#x20;to have your say on the draft strategy by 5pm Friday 14 May.
