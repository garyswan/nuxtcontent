If you love the Sunshine Coast and want to help protect its environment and improve liveability, here’s your chance.

Sunshine Coast Council is looking to refresh its Banksia Award-winning Environment and Liveability Strategy (ELS), which provides long-term direction for guiding growth and shaping the future of the region.

Now in the sixth year of the strategy’s implementation, Council is seeking the community’s input to ensure it remains future-focused and provides a contemporary approach to deliver a healthy environment and liveable Sunshine Coast as we move toward 2041.

Environment portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said our region’s environment and lifestyle were central to maintaining the Sunshine Coast’s character and status as a great place to live.

“From expanding our green spaces, achieving international recognition as a UNESCO Biosphere, to creating great places and spaces, the ELS has already guided many great outcomes for our environment and liveability,” Cr Cox said.

To contribute, residents are encouraged to spend 10 minutes [completing an online survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/ELSrefresh)
.

The survey asks residents which environment and liveability issues they believe most need to be addressed, and the priority action required.

Environment portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the purpose of the strategy was to strike balance between natural and built environments.

“As the Sunshine Coast continues to grow, it is important that we remain well positioned to respond to changes that will present both challenges and opportunities for our future,” Cr Suarez said.

“This strategy is vital to setting Council’s priorities and it’s important for community members to tell us what matters most to them.”

Insights gained from the survey will also build upon feedback received through other previous in-person and online community engagement.

Visit [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/ELSrefresh)
&#x20;to take the survey before submissions close on May 26.
