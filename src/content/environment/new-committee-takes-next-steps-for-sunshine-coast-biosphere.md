A new Sunshine Coast Biosphere Coordinating Committee will guide the implementation of the [Sunshine Coast Biosphere](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Biosphere)
, following their first official meeting this month (September 2).

Committee Chair Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the coordinating committee’s formation was an exciting milestone for the newly designated Sunshine Coast Biosphere.

“By establishing this part of our biosphere governance arrangements, the key decision-making body to provide leadership and direction for implementation is now in place,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The coordinating committee will play a lead role in determining the biosphere’s implementation priorities, as well as monitoring and reporting progress along the way.

“It also has an important role to play in ensuring our biosphere plan reflects our region’s uniqueness and embraces opportunities for us to work together in pursuing our aim to be internationally renowned as a place where people live, learn, work and play sustainably.

“I welcome the coordinating committee’s commitment to manage our Sunshine Coast Biosphere in line with the governing principles, aim and objectives that were established in partnership with the community during the nomination phase.”

The coordinating committee is comprised of 11 members including representatives from Jinibara People Aboriginal Corporation and Kabi Kabi First Nations Traditional Custodians, three portfolio Councillors, three members of council’s executive leadership team (including the Chief Executive Officer as Deputy Chairperson), the Biosphere Community Advisory Group Chair and a Queensland Government representative.

Coordinating committee member and Biosphere Community Advisory Group Chair Will Shrapnel said one of the exciting outcomes from the inaugural meeting was the consideration of a Biosphere Performance Measurement Framework – a fit-for-purpose tool that identified measurable targets for our biosphere.

“The framework will help us monitor how we are performing with respect to sustainability indicators and will be a valuable tool underpinning our progress reporting to UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme and our Sunshine Coast community,” Mr Shrapnel said.

Kabi Kabi representative Aunty Helena Gulash said sustainability was a major strength of Traditional Custodians, as it had been for thousands of years.

“This is an exciting opportunity to revitalise our connections and identify potential areas where we can lead the way,” Aunty Helena Gulash said.

Jinibara Elder Colin Ross said the implementation of our Sunshine Coast Biosphere was about interpreting what the designation meant for our First Nations people and future generations.

“Our role as Traditional Custodians is important because our approach to understanding and managing changes and interactions within spiritual, social and ecological systems has always existed in Jinibara People's ways of being, knowing and doing,” Uncle Colin Ross said.

“We are now prepared to share with everyone as a lived ’living’ experience. In actual fact we’ve always done that.

“It’s great working with Sunshine Coast Council and the Biosphere engagement team that acknowledges our pivotal role.”

The Sunshine Coast Biosphere Coordinating Committee members include:

*   Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson (Chair)
*   Emma Thomas, Sunshine Coast Council CEO (Deputy Chair)
*   Will Shrapnel, Sunshine Coast Biosphere Community Advisory Group Chair
*   Uncle Colin Ross, Jinibara Elder
*   Aunty Helena Gulash, Kabi Kabi Elder
*   Cr Maria Suarez, Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 and Environment Portfolio Councillor
*   Cr David Law, Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor
*   Cr Terry Landsberg, Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor
*   Bill Haddrill, Sunshine Coast Council Acting Group Executive, Liveability and Natural Assets
*   Greg Laverty, Sunshine Coast Council Group Executive, Economic and Community Development
*   Queensland Government representative

The Sunshine Coast Biosphere implementation phase governance framework was developed in consultation with the Biosphere Community Reference Group during the nomination phase.

The coordinating committee’s formation and member representation aligns to the biosphere’s governance principles of “Balanced, Transparent, Inclusive and Responsive”.

The Sunshine Coast was officially [recognised as a UNESCO Biosphere](https://oursc.com.au/featured/sunshine-coast-officially-becomes-a-unesco-biosphere)
&#x20;in June 2022. For more information, [visit council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Biosphere)
