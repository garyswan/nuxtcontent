Most of the migratory shorebirds have now arrived on our shores after completing a marathon flight over many days without a break.

Shorebirds are also called wader birds.

Their long legs are great for wading, but not for swimming.

Once they started their journey across the Pacific Ocean, there is no stopping to sleep or eat for these endurance fliers.

When they arrive on our coast, theyâ€™re hungry and tired, so ensure to share our shores and keep your distance.

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
