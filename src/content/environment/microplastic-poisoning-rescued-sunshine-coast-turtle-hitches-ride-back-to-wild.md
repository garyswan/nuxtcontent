A tiny post-hatchling turtle suffering from plastic ingestion was released back into the ocean yesterday, thanks to a helping hand from [SEA LIFE Sunshine Coast Aquarium](https://www.visitsealife.com/sunshine-coast/)
&#x20;and [Brisbane Marine Pilot Boats](https://www.brisbanepilots.com.au/)
.

Rescued from Wurtulla beach by a community member and handed into one of our Sunshine Coast Council TurtleCare Officers, the post-hatchling loggerhead turtle named Spinny has spent the last month recovering at SEA LIFE.

Weighing in at only 27 grams and 5cm long, Spinny was covered in marine algae and open ocean barnacles, which indicated that the post-hatchling had emerged from a nesting beach further north of the Sunshine Coast.

Suspicions of plastic pollution were quickly confirmed as the tiny turtle excreted microplastics for four days following its rescue.

The microplastics were collected to contribute to a global study into microplastics and marine turtles.

Recently Spinny caught a lift back out to the East Australian Current with the Brisbane Marine Pilot Boats.

We are proud to partner with SEA LIFE Sunshine Coast Aquarium and thank the team at the SEA LIFE Sunshine Coastâ€™s Turtle Rehabilitation Centre for the high level of care they gave Spinny to get him happy and healthy again.
