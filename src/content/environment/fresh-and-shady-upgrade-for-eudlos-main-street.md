After finalising a new streetscape design for Rosebed Street, the main thoroughfare is boasting vibrancy and coming up roses with a leafy green boost.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said the upgrade enhanced the day-to-day experience of locals, visitors and businesses in Eudlo.

“Works started in January on making the town’s streets safer for pedestrians and road users by keeping our youngest residents safe when journeying to school,” Cr Johnston said.

“The pedestrian crossing on Rosebed Street and Corlis Avenue have been upgraded, and I think the community will enjoy the upgrades providing an appealing walkable environment.

“The improvements focused on giving the town a green injection to cool and beautify the urban environment.

“Some of the carparks have been realigned in the centre of Rosebed Street to make way for three garden beds boasting three large shade trees and more than 700 smaller shrubs and groundcovers.

“In addition, council will also be adding new solar lights, to the three new centre garden beds on Rosebed Street, which will provide for a welcoming entrance during the evenings. 

“These beneficial changes go a long way to delivering social, economic and sustainable benefits for Eudlo.”

The upgrade was part of an extensive streetscape engagement process from November 2020.

Council asked the community to share what they loved and what could be improved to enhance Rosebed Street, to develop a draft streetscape concept plan. 

Locals, visitors and businesses then worked with the Placemaking and Design team, attended a series of community events and completed online surveys, to create a space everyone can enjoy.

Further feedback was sought on the final concept plan in July 2021, which was refined to develop the community’s values and vision and enhance the town’s unique characteristics.
