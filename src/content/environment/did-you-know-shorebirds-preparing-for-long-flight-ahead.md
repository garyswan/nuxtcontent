It’s time for the shorebirds to get ready for migration back to the northern hemisphere.

It will be a long trip to the first rest stop in Asia, up to a week of non-stop flying.

To have enough energy for this journey, some birds almost double their weight in six weeks leading up to the trip.

Give them space to feed and put on plenty of weight.

You can share our shoreline with these long-distance travellers by:

• observing from a distance using binoculars

• choosing a location away from the birds for your activities

• keeping your dogs under control

• taking your rubbish home.
