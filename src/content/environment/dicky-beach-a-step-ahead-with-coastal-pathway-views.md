Head down to Dicky Beach and take a walk or scenic cycle along the newest link of coastal pathway boasting sweeping vistas!

A 500 metre section of the coastal pathway from Cooroora Street through to Dicky Beach Skatepark is part of the 73 kilometre [coastal pathway network](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
&#x20;– the Coast’s longest and most popular shared pathway, extending from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the new link had been well received by our community.

“It’s been great to see so many already riding and walking along the new 3-metre-wide link – plenty of space for everyone,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The pathway really does show off the sweeping coastline allowing residents and visitors to enjoy the beauty, rather than travel along Elizabeth Street.

“As part of the works, the car park upgrade includes an additional two new car spaces and an extra motorcycle bay at the Lower Neill Street carpark will also further benefit our community.

“We have also installed three picnic tables and three new park seats to ensure it’s inviting for families and offers a new space to meet and socialise while outdoors.

“I’m really pleased to see the works completed with vegetation maintenance to continue over the next few months.

“I’d also like to thank the adjacent residents for their cooperation during the construction period.”

This upgrade follows on from the Dicky Beach Precinct Plan Stage 1 completion last year.
