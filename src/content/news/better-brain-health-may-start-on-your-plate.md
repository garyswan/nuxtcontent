An easy-to-digest workshop exploring ways over-50s can take control of their brain health plus the relationship between healthy food, social connection and mental engagement will be held on October 1 at Mudjimba.

*Food for Thought – Building healthy brains together* is a half-day workshop presented by Council in collaboration with the Healthy Ageing Partnership (HAP), and supported by the Queensland Government and the Council on The Ageing Queensland during Seniors Month.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged people to book now.

“There will be practical cooking demonstrations, a delicious morning tea, a take-home pack with recipes and some great health and wellbeing resources courtesy of USC Nutrition students, plus USC guest speakers and lots of fun interactive activities,” Cr Law said.

“*Food for Thought* is designed to empower participants with strategies to implement simple and sustainable lifestyle changes to improve their brain health and prevent cognitive decline, including dementia, memory loss and confusion, plus mental health decline – no matter what your age.

“This program ties in beautifully with our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;and one of our key goals to help people lead healthy, active lifestyles.”

USC Senior Lecturer in Nutrition and Dietetics Dr Hattie Wright said the simple act of sharing a meal with family and friends could have a powerful impact on a person’s immediate and long-term mental health.

“And choosing healthy and nutritious meals can further maximise your mental and brain health,” Dr Wright said.

“During this workshop you will learn more about the latest research on the link between food, mood and brain health. We will also share easy steps on how to incorporate the principles of a brain-friendly diet into your everyday life.”
