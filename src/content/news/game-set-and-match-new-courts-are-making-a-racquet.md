It’s time to dust off the racquet and enjoy a hit of tennis at the newly upgraded courts at the [Sunshine Coast Tennis Centre](https://play.tennis.com.au/opencourtsessions/sunshinecoasttenniscentre#courthire)
&#x20;in Caloundra. 

Two of the courts, which were in a deteriorated condition, are now coming up ace’s after being upgraded to synthetic turf courts.

Tennis stars and local players will be eager to break in the new courts which are now at a competitive standard alongside the rest of the centre’s courts.

**The project included**:

*   New fence mesh
*   New entry and centre posts
*   New nets and winders
*   New synthetic turf surfaces
*   4 x new double head lights
*   Removal of the old, deteriorated timber posts
*   Associated landscape and pathways.

&#x20;served up a new clubhouse, change rooms, a first aid room, a tournament office, retail space and dedicated community space.
