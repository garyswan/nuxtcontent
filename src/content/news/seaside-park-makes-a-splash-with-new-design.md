Along our expansive coastline, just metres from the squelching sand, lies a leafy pocket in need of a revamp.

Warana’s John Hotton Park is a place many locals seek shelter in the shade, hit pause after a surf at the beach or seek adventure if you’re young at heart.

It is located along Oceanic Drive opposite Lapoinya Crescent at Beach Access 232 and provides a playground, picnic tables, sheltered barbecue facility, public amenities and on street parking. 

Now the park’s future is in the spotlight, with Sunshine Coast Council encouraging the community to [provide feedback](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/JohnHottonPark)
&#x20;on potential improvements before April 17, 2023.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the local-level park served the Warana community and was a popular link to the beach and the future Coastal Pathway.

“Council aims to enhance the park experience and address the challenges currently facing it,” Cr Natoli said.

“This open green park was named after a prominent local resident John Hotton who passed away in 2004. John was a council employee who cared for the park during the Caloundra City Council days.

“The care and connection given to this park by members of our community is important to continue and recognise.  

“I encourage our community to consider how the park is being used, how we can further develop its identity and how we can enhance the space for the benefit of local residents and the wider community.

“Although there is no budget to upgrade John Hotton Park at this time, your feedback will assist council in preparing a concept plan based on the input received from the community.

“However, funding has been allocated to renew the park’s public amenities building this year.”

Community engagement is open from March 31 to April 17, 2023. Please provide feedback on the draft concept plan by visiting Council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/JohnHottonPark)
.
