The impact of a series of major landslips caused by recent weather events has been assessed with a dozen Sunshine Coast roads now facing significant repairs.

Heavy rain hit the region between February and May with the worst affected areas being Bald Knob, Wootha (west of Maleny), Glenview, Eudlo, Coolum, Peachester, Montville and Towen Mountain.

The cost of rebuilding the most damaged roads is estimated at $15 million and could take up to two years with highest priority being given to those with the most significant impact.

Local Disaster Management Group Chair and Mayor Mark Jamieson said recovery and rectification works started immediately and would continue for some time.

“At the time of the severe weather events, council crews closed roads for our community’s safety, with recovery from these severe weather events continuing for a long time after the immediate threat passes,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Geotechnical assessments have identified 12 major landslip sites that require engineered solutions and funding support.

“The assistance will be provided through the jointly funded Commonwealth-State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA). 

“Council continues to work closely with the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, all levels of government, along with emergency and community agencies, to support our community as the region navigates the long-term impacts of the flooding events.”

The 12 major landslip sites across our region include:  

*   Policeman Spur Road, Wootha
*   Bald Knob Road, Bald Knob 
*   Leeding Road, Glenview 
*   Perrins Road, Eudlo
*   First Bay, Coolum
*   River Road, Peachester
*   Narrows Road, Montville
*   Towen Mountain Road, Towen Mountain 
*   Hovard Road - Slip 1, Bald Knob 
*   Hovard Road - Slip 2, Bald Knob 
*   Tanawha Tourist Drive, Tanawha 
*   Old Maleny Road, Landsborough

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston thanked the community for their patience while council carried out the necessary works and secured the necessary funding.

“Some roads have been closed or reduced to single lane access, based on preliminary reports about road stability,” Cr Johnston said.

“While this is inconvenient, the road closures are necessary for the safety of residents and road users.

“The landslide at Hovard Road, Bald Knob has closed off the thoroughfare, and I’m eager to see repair works start soon to help minimise the impact on Bald Knob residents and surrounding communities.

“Landslip repair works include removing soil and vegetation debris, constructing mass block retaining walls, buried pile and beam walls, drainage works, road reconstruction and stabilising sloped hillsides. 

“Design works have started for this job which will be a vastly complex construction project which is estimated to cost $5 million and one that is unlikely to be completed until 2024.

“We are liaising with the affected local residents, and we are providing as much information as we can to keep the community informed throughout the construction works.”

From April to June 2022, council invested $4.4 million into our road network, rehabilitating and resurfacing 10.8 kilometres of local roads to improve community safety.

Almost $23 million was invested on a total of 82.5 kilometres of roads across our region in the 2021–22 financial year – that’s 641,418m². This year’s completed works are an increase of 29 kilometres on the prior year.

**Council’s road safety tips**

*   Use the

    [Road Look Up](https://qldtraffic.qld.gov.au/lookup.html)


    website to find out if you should report road damage to local council or Transport and Main Roads. 

*   Check council’s

    [Roads Hub](https://roads.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)


    mapping tool to check for delays before heading out on the roads. 

*   If you see a pothole, don’t assume someone else has already reported it. Do your good deed for the day and

    [report it](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council)


    for the safety of other road users. 

*   Council maintains almost 3000km of local roads and bridges throughout the region. 

*   It’s council’s number one priority to keep our roads and users safe, so we have repair crews on the ground every day closely monitoring and maintaining emerging potholes. 

*   Drive to the conditions and please keep a lookout for potential potholes and landslips.
