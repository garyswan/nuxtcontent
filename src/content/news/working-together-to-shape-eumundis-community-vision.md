Home to artisan treasures, rich heritage, creative arts and markets, Eumundi’s village feel is being enhanced in a new streetscape design for Memorial Drive.

Sunshine Coast Council continues to work with members of the Save the Memorial Drive Campaign, Eumundi community groups, businesses and other stakeholders highly interested in the Eumundi Streetscape Project.

On 21 April 2023, a workshop will be held with these nominated representatives. 

This workshop will unpack the draft detailed design and the community engagement and design processes undertaken by Council since October 2020. 

Representatives in the workshop will have the opportunity to share their perspectives and clarify design priorities and technical aspects with placemaking and discipline experts. They will also contribute feedback on a number of detailed design elements.

Council and private consulting topic experts will be attending the workshop to answer questions and explain throughout the workshop:

*   pedestrian, movement, traffic and parking
*   character, place and heritage interpretation
*   maintenance and town pride.

The workshop will recognise the extensive community feedback and submissions received in the last two years that have informed the draft detailed design for the Memorial Drive Streetscape Upgrade. 

This workshop is the final session of community engagement for this project.

As this workshop is invitational only, a summary of this session and an update on the detailed design will then be provided to the broader community for information. 

Thank you in advance to the community groups, businesses and residents who have been on this journey with Council and are attending this final session to shape the future of Memorial Drive.

Following the workshop, detailed design will be completed and construction of the Memorial Drive, Eumundi streetscape upgrade will start late 2023.
