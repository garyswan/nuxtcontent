**James 'Jim' Hocking** was born in Nambour as the second child of William and Eva Hocking's five children. When war was declared in 1939, three Hocking boys were ready to sign up. As soon as Jim turned 18, he enlisted with the Citizens Military Forces before being discharged after four months to take up acceptance in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942.

He was sent to England to train on the heavy bombers of the RAF during World War Two. On July 28, 1944, the 21-year-old RAAF pilot was flying a Stirling Bomber or “flying coffin” during a final training run before heading into battle.

The engine caught fire as he approached the village of March in the Fenland region of the UK. Ordering the crew of six to jump for their lives, Jim remained at the controls manoeuvring the plane away from the town of March.

His courageous sacrifice meant the fuel laden plane plunged into a field about a kilometre from the town saving many lives. He had saved the town but lost his life.

He is buried in Cambridge Cemetery far from Australia where the inscription on his headstone reads, *'Nobly he lived. Nobly he died. Remembered*.'

In 1987, residents of the town of March gathered to honour this remarkable man they had never met. There is a memorial to him at March's St Wendreda's Church and a permanent display about his life in the town's museum.

In 2016 Jim Hocking was awarded posthumous the Star of Courage the second highest decoration for Australian bravery.

Although his heroism went largely unknown for 42 years, his bravery resulted in the Sister City agreement between England’s Fenland District Council and the Maroochy Shire Council in 1997.
