Tickets have just been released to see award-winning stand-up comedian, television host, writer and podcaster Wil Anderson live on stage at Venue 114 on 12 November.

Theatre-goers might know Wil as the host and executive producer of the ABC’s most popular show *Gruen*, or from his various podcasts including *Wilosophy*, but it’s on stage where Wil feels most at home. His comedy is high energy, unpredictable and has a joke count that should carry a heart health warning.

Astute and hilarious, Wil has won the People’s Choice Award for a record six times at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, selling more tickets than any other act and cementing himself as Australia’s comedian of choice. After more than 20 years in the game Wil is a relentless innovator, with shows that get better each year.

Wil Anderson is simply as good as comedy gets in our part of the world.

“Savage intelligence and rapid-fire riffing, Wil Anderson confronts humanity head-on.” *Time Out*, 2019

“An absolute comedy masterclass. Even the unscripted crowd work is pure bliss.” *Melbourne Lyf*, 2019
