Interested in the future of [Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park](https://oursc.com.au/featured/how-community-is-shaping-future-of-unique-coastal-reserve)
?  Then please provide your feedback on the draft master plan before **July 2, 2023**.   

Sunshine Coast Council is looking to enhance, protect and manage this special place for our community's enjoyment now and for generations to come.

Environment and Liveability Councillor Peter Cox said Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park were among our region’s most loved areas.

Cr Cox said the area held enormous lifestyle, environmental, recreational and cultural heritage significance.

“With more than 500,000 people expected to call the Sunshine Coast home by 2041, and data shows that up to 4,500 people may visit the reserve and park in a single day, a long-term plan is an absolute must, to ensure we can all continue to enjoy this area,” Cr Cox said.

“Extensive community feedback gathered since 2021 has helped to inform the draft master plan.

“This formal feedback shows that many people want to preserve or enhance what they already love or value rather than wanting dramatic change in the area.

“For this reason, the draft master plan proposes minimal infrastructure changes and aims to achieve a balance between the needs of all user groups including retaining all current recreational uses, while enhancing and protecting the environment,” Cr Cox said.

“We really need our community’s input on key features of the draft master plan which includes proposed changes to not just Point Cartwright Reserve, but our much loved La Balsa Park.

“Do you want to see the boat ramp upgraded, new playground, more picnic areas and shade trees, reconfigured parking, traffic calming, viewing platforms and exercise equipment?

“These are all potential ideas which we would like our community’s input on before the survey closes on Sunday.”

Share your feedback on the key elements before the online survey closes Sunday July 2, 2023 at [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/point-cartwright-la-balsa-park-master-plan)
.

Council has been working closely with the community and independent specialists to gain ideas to guide the development of the draft master plan – a vision for the future, from now until year 2041.

Following this consultation, the master plan will be finalised, and projects identified for future budget consideration and delivery.

#### Proposed key features for the master plan:  

*   **Enhanced community safety** – ensuring a safer public realm for all to enjoy 
*   **Enhanced environmental protection** – for areas of significant habitat and sites of significant cultural heritage value identified by our First Nations People.
*   **Enhanced accessibility and recreational opportunities** – improved pathway network (wider paths, improved surfaces, improved alignment).
*   **Improved facilities** – upgraded park furniture, equipment, improved barbeque and shelters.
*   **More shade** – for pathways, furniture, playground, picnic areas.
*   **Playground improvements** – including interpretive/educational elements and increased play value.
*   **More interpretive and educational elements** – for nature based passive recreation and cultural heritage appreciation
*   **Sustainable pet access** – by retaining pet access in the reserve and park (on leash) without time restrictions, prohibiting pet access to areas of the reserve and park of profound cultural and/or environmental significance, and proposing an additional dog off-leash beach area. *\*Note these changes are subject to the local law amendment process and will be subject to a separate community engagement process later this year.*
