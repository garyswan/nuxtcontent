Have we got it right? That’s the question Sunshine Coast Council will be asking the community this month, on a new look main street for Eudlo. 

In November last year, council asked the community to share what they loved and what could be improved to enhance Rosebed Street.

Divisional Councillor Winston Johnston said the ideas and feedback received in this first stage of engagement were used to develop a draft streetscape concept plan, which is now ready for the community to review.

“The Placemaking Streetscape Project aims to improve the day-to-day experience of people living, working and visiting the hinterland town,” Cr Johnston said.

“We aren’t looking to change Eudlo’s identity. Instead we want to enhance what the community already loves about the lively township.

“After conducting online surveys, a series of conversations and community events, Eudlo residents told us they want to see more shady, cool and green streets, safer streets for pedestrian and motorists and an appealing and walkable environment for the community to enjoy on a daily basis.

“I encourage the Eudlo community to come down to share your ideas with the team and enjoy a free sausage sizzle in Eudlo Park on Saturday 22 May between 8 and 11am.

“If you can’t make it in person, then jump online and provide your feedback from tomorrow (21 May) to 11 June by visiting council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.”

Council’s series of placemaking projects aims to create vibrant places that enhance the unique characters of our towns and draw from community feedback.

Similar completed projects include beautifying and enhancing Landsborough, Palmwoods, Beerwah and Pacific Paradise.

Following community feedback, the final designs will be produced, with construction (subject to final approvals and budget allocations) scheduled to take place in the 2021/2022 financial year. Council will keep the community updated as the project progresses.
