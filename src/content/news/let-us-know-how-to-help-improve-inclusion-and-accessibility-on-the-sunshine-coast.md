The Sunshine Coast community is known for its generosity and kind-heartedness and now is the chance for residents to go one step further and have their say on the Draft Inclusion Action Plan for People with Disability 2024-2028.

In its ongoing commitment to prioritising disability access and inclusion for the area, Sunshine Coast Council has drafted the plan to help create a region where people of all abilities have equitable opportunities to live, work, visit and play.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Draft Inclusion Action Plan demonstrates Council’s continuing commitment to improve inclusion for people with disability on the Sunshine Coast.

“Council is focusing on the practical and achievable actions that will help improve the way of life for people living with disabilities over the next five years,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/regional-strategies/sunshine-coast-community-strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;highlights many areas of disability access and inclusion for people of all abilities but we’d like to hear from the community about how we can go further.

“Community feedback will help shape a more accessible and inclusive Sunshine Coast region for all.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said one in six Australians have a disability and up to 90 per cent of disabilities are invisible\*.

“This highlights the importance of this plan and why we want the Sunshine Coast to be a region where people of all abilities have equitable opportunities by 2028,” Cr Law said.

“This plan has been drafted through extensive targeted consultation with people with lived experience of disability and their carers, disability support workers and the Inclusion Action Plan Reference Group, which included people with disability, caregivers, and people working in the disability sector.

“The draft action plan has identified four guiding principles and commitments, including promoting and protecting human rights, increasing disability awareness, valuing lived experience and improving access, and sets out five key priority areas for action.

“I encourage our community to provide their feedback on the draft action plan via an [online or hard copy survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/draft-inclusion-action-plan-people-disability/library-drop-sessions)
&#x20;or by attending one of the [library drop-in session](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/draft-inclusion-action-plan-people-disability/library-drop-sessions)
s between July 12 and 19.”

Visit [Council’s Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/draft-inclusion-action-plan-people-disability)
&#x20;for more information and to provide your feedback before July 31.

The draft plan is available in a range of formats, including an easy English version. If assistance is required to provide feedback, you can also contact Council via phone.
