News that a new water park project at Glenview is proposed to begin in November this year is not only thrilling but will provide the region with its first new major theme park in more than three decades.

With this announcement and the warmer weather approaching, many will recall the region’s former water-based tourist attractions including the landmark ‘Pacific Super Slide’ located on the corner of Okinja Road and Wirraway Street at Alexandra Headland.

The Pacific Super Slide was officially opened on 1 September 1986 by Fred Murray, the then Chairman of Maroochy Shire Council. The complex was designed and built at a cost of approximately $1.5 million by the original owner Andrew Vizi, a mechanical engineer. It included seven waterslides, a wading pool, solar heated pool, video games room, picnic area and snack bar.

In 1988 the Vizi family sold the Pacific Super Slide and it was then renamed the ‘Olympia Theme Park'. The popular water park was demolished in 2006 to make way for the construction of an apartment block.

**Thanks to Sunshine Coast Council’s Heritage Library Officers for the words and Picture Sunshine Coast for the images.**
