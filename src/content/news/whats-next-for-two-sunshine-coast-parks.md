Thank you to the many locals, visitors and businesses for participating in the recent Have Your Say survey and providing your feedback on the Concept Plan for Jessica Park and Cotton Tree Park.

The community engagement period between 25 November and 12 December 2022 asked the community for its vision for possible park improvements and aimed to enhance what people already loved about the parks and address the challenges currently facing each.

Over the next few months council’s design and placemaking team will carefully assess all feedback and survey results. This will include further design exploration, identifying our community’s priorities, speaking with other council teams and developing a final plan for presentation to council.

While the proposed improvements are not currently included in council’s 10-year Capital Works Program for construction, community feedback on the plan will help council plan ahead and scope indicative costs so that potential funding opportunities and construction stages can be identified over the following years.

Thank you to the community for your interest and participation to help shape Jessica Park and Cotton Tree Park’s future. 

As the project continues to progress, council will keep our community informed or you can subscribe to receive project updates below.
