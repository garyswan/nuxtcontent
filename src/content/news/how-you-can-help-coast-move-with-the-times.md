Pedestrians and cyclists will be asked to reveal their challenges in getting around as part of an initiative that aims to improve safety and accessibility across the region.

The MoveSafe program will begin in Division 3, between Aroona and Wurtulla, where residents, visitors and businesses will be encouraged to highlight locations they believe active transport improvements could be made.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said he was excited to see this new community engagement campaign rolled out in his division.

“Feedback received will help us to better understand current and future transport challenges and opportunities in the area – mapping a way forward to ensure a safe and reliable active transport network in our division, Cr Cox said.

“I encourage everyone living, working or playing in Aroona, Bokarina, Birtinya, Currimundi, Little Mountain, Meridan Plains, Warana and Wurtulla to get involved and share their thoughts and ideas with us."

The MoveSafe community engagement campaign will involve a range of activities to engage with members of the local community to gather data on their experience with active transport in Division 3.

Community members wishing to share feedback on the MoveSafe campaign are encouraged to do so before 5pm Sunday, May 7, 2023.

### Submissions can be lodged via Council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/movesafe-division-3)
 or by going to one of the following MoveSafe pop-ups:

*   Stockland Birtinya Saturday 22 April, 8am-1pm
*   Kawana Farmers Market Saturday 29 April, 7am-midday.

The MoveSafe engagement campaign is funded by Council’s Transport Levy.
