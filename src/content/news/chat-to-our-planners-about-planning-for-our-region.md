Sunshine Coast Council is in the early stages of preparing a new planning scheme which will guide future growth and development and help preserve the things we love about our region.  

Mayor Mark Jamieson said community members were invited to have a face-to-face chat with Sunshine Coast Council’s New Planning Scheme Project team to learn more about the proposed planning directions for our region and local areas.

“This is a fantastic way for community members to have their say on future planning for our growing region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“With the easing of social distancing restrictions, council is pleased to extend its engagement program to include a series of [12 drop-in information sessions from March](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/information-sessions)
&#x20;13-24 at various locations across the Sunshine Coast.

“To continue to support and strengthen our ‘community of communities’, [eighteen local plan areas](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/local-directions)
&#x20;(LPAs) are proposed as part of the [new planning scheme](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Development/Planning-Documents/New-Sunshine-Coast-Planning-Scheme)
&#x20;for the Sunshine Coast.”

Proposed [local plan areas (LPAs)](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/newplanningscheme/local-directions)
&#x20;include:

*   Beerwah – Landsborough
*   Blackall Range – Maleny
*   Bli Bli – Maroochy River Plains
*   Buderim and Surrounds
*   Caloundra and Surrounds
*   Coolum – Peregian
*   Eumundi - Doonan
*   Glasshouse - Pumicestone
*   Kawana Waters
*   Maroochydore
*   Mary Valley – Kenilworth
*   Mooloolaba – Alexandra Headlands
*   Mooloolah Valley
*   Nambour and Surrounds
*   North Shore
*   Sippy Downs – Palmview
*   Woombye – Palmwoods
*   Yandina – Maroochy River Valley

“Local area plans are already a feature of the current planning scheme, but eighteen new local plan areas are proposed to be included in the new planning scheme,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Customising planning for local areas will help to make sure the new planning scheme is not one-size-fits-all.

“The proposed local plan areas cover the whole of the Sunshine Coast and are inclusive of rural areas and non-urban areas.

“For the first time local towns and villages will be considered in their broader setting and context.

“Understanding what a local community considers to be their values and aspirations will ensure that the planning scheme allows each of our diverse communities to thrive in their own way.”

The outcomes of the preliminary consultation will be used to inform the preparation of a draft new planning scheme, including local area provisions.

The community will have the opportunity to provide further feedback on that draft.

The new planning scheme is intended to be in place by 2024.
