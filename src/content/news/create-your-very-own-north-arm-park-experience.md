Have you ever wanted to pick and choose your local parks play equipment? Here's your chance!

Sunshine Coast Council is calling on North Arm community to ‘go shopping’ for their favourite play elements as part of stage 1 of North Arm Park’s playground upgrade.

In April council asked the community to share their ideas for the development of North Arm Park.

Council is now asking the community ‘\_Have we got it right?\_’ and is seeking further input on the draft landscape concept plan for the park.

As part of this next phase, the project team would like the community to choose which play equipment they would like to see in the park by using ‘virtual dollars’ to pick and choose!

## **SAVE THE DATE**

Share your feedback with the project team at the North Arm Park on Saturday, 22 October 2022 between 8am and noon.

Can’t make it in person? Complete the [survey now](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/north-arm-park)
&#x20;to provide your thoughts and ideas on the draft landscape concept plan before 28 October 2022.
