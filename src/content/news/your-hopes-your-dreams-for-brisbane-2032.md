From today Monday December 5, Australians will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to share their hopes and dreams for Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games legacy with the launch of an online national survey.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today also confirmed a Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum for 22 March 2023 at the Royal International Convention Centre.

“These Games belong to all of us,” the Premier said.

“I want everyone to share the pride of hosting the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games  and the golden opportunity this honour represents.”

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said as a key delivery partner in the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Sunshine Coast had an incredible opportunity to help shape the 10 years before and 10 years after this once-in-a-lifetime event. 

“The Sunshine Coast community is well positioned to do so, with Council having established the 2032 Sunshine Coast Legacy Plan Community Reference Group earlier this year to help shape our region’s legacy plan for our region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We also look forward to hearing from Queenslanders as to their hopes and dreams and working closely with other 2032 Games partners and the wider community to shape this overarching legacy plan for Queensland and our nation.”

“The Hopes and Dreams online survey gives Australians everywhere their say on the legacy they want for the host nation of the Brisbane 2032 Games,” the Premier said.

“Australia’s legacy ideas - our brightest hopes and dreams – will be road-tested at next year’s Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum.”

The Forum brings together 500 Australian community and business leaders, athletes and our Games delivery partners to start mapping out the 2032 Games legacy plan.            

Minister Assisting the Premier on Olympics and Paralympics Sport and Engagement Stirling Hinchliffe said the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Committee would bring the priorities of Queensland communities to the Legacy Forum.

“The 12 members of the Committee are working hard in their communities and hearing the voices of thousands of Queenslanders on legacy,” Mr Hinchliffe said. 

“Next year’s Legacy Forum combines the Committee’s work on Queensland-specific legacy with the hopes and dreams of the nation.

“We’re identifying and planning for legacy early to maximise the benefits of the 2032 Games over the next 20 years to 2042.

“The Hope and Dreams survey and Brisbane’s 2032 Legacy Forum will be important for developing the bigger picture of what Games legacy looks like for Queenslanders and Australians.”

Brisbane’s Legacy Forum will deliver a draft vision, draft themes and list of priorities for further feedback.

**Games Delivery Partners:**

President of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games Organising Committee, Mr Andrew Liveris: “We have an opportunity to elevate the lifestyles of all Queenslanders by unlocking the opportunity that the Games present. Now is the time to be part of the conversation that defines our future. I encourage everyone to get involved to ensure the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan is a true reflection of our community’s vision and aspiration.”

Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll says this is a generational opportunity to deliver a lasting legacy through sport for Australia by lifting the health and wellbeing of all Australians. “We need to hear from everyone involved in our Olympic sports about the vision they have. From grass roots to high performance we know that Brisbane 2032 can supercharge sport in Australia and we need to hear from our community how that can happen.”

Paralympics Australia CEO Catherine Clark: “Brisbane 2032 can be life-changing for so many members of our community and we know that the positive impact can extend so far beyond sport. A Paralympic Games on our shores brings an opportunity, and a responsibility, to make meaningful change for Queenslanders and all Australians with a focus on bridging the gap that still exists for many. In providing our full support for Brisbane 2032 Legacy planning, PA is encouraging members of the community to provide their Hopes and Dreams feedback, particularly those living with a disability.”
