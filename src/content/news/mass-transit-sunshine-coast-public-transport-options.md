The opportunity to have your say on the preferred public transport options for our region starts today (28 April).

Over the next eight weeks until 22 June 2021, Sunshine Coast Council is encouraging our residents to provide their feedback on a range of options being considered in the draft [Mass Transit Options Analysis report](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Document-Library)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said an efficient and accessible public transport network was critical for our region.

“We expect more than 518,000 people will want to live here in the next 20 years,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“First and foremost, we want our Sunshine Coast to continue to be one of the best places to live.

“But we cannot sit on our hands and do nothing about how people move around our region.

“Simply continuing to build roads, which only encourages people to use a private vehicle, is no longer an option for us.

“Our major road networks are experiencing significant congestion now and that will only get worse if nothing changes.

“If we do nothing, our roads and suburbs will choke on traffic congestion and the liveability of our region will be irreparably compromised.

“While the State Government is responsible for the public transport system, council has an important role to play in working with the Department of Transport and Main Roads to do the planning work to encourage the necessary investment by government.

“If we do not do so, then there is little likelihood that any substantive and efficient public transport solution will be delivered.

“I am sure we all agree our current and future residents need to be able to get to the beach, shopping centres, health facilities or where they work easily, efficiently and sustainably – without adding to traffic congestion.

“That is why our council wants everyone to have their say on getting around the Sunshine Coast so we can protect our lifestyle, maintain our community fabric and continue to enjoy a great place to live, work and play.”

The comprehensive community engagement process, which was endorsed by council in August last year, is seeking community opinion on a wide range of potential options.

The options considered in the draft Mass Transit Options Analysis range from bus network upgrades to a quality bus corridor to bus rapid transit, trackless trams, light rail transit and more.

The input from our community will help inform any recommendations which council may make to the State Government for its consideration in a detailed business case – which is the final phase in the business case development process.

    on public transport options before June 22, 2021.

Deputy Mayor and Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said council valued community input and understood the importance of providing an opportunity to have a say.

“From today, our residents can view the full draft Sunshine Coast Mass Transit Options Analysis report and then provide their thoughts and ideas back to council through a number of planned community engagement activities,” Cr Baberowski said.

“We want to know, how you will make your way around the region, not only today but well into the future as our region continues to grow.

 “An online survey tool provides the perfect opportunity to really get people thinking about their current views on growth, their transport preferences and how that might change in the future.

“We encourage you to get involved, either online or in person, by attending community engagement events at local markets, libraries and shopping centres.”

The outcomes of the community and stakeholder feedback about the mass transit options will inform the final Mass Transit Options Analysis report, which will be considered by council later this year.
