Sunshine Coast Lightning will be headed by an elite group of leaders this season, with the Club officially announcing Steph Wood as Captain in 2022.

Laura Scherian and Tara Hinchliffe have been elevated as co-Vice Captains, while Karla Pretorius will round out the official leadership group.

The group boasts a strong spread of talent, experience and leadership qualities that will bolster and elevate the team for the season and beyond.

Head Coach Kylee Byrne was excited to announce the new leadership team as part of the 2022 Season Launch event.

“Our Club has a proud history of leaders and I know that Steph, Tara and Shez will continue that legacy,” Byrne said.

“Steph is a world class athlete and I’ve watched her confidence grow throughout her career and to now see her step into that Captaincy role is real reward for effort for her.

“Steph is a natural leader who can drive standards and accountability, while also inspiring her teammates with her output and energy on court.

“Shez is such a great Club person who leads through her actions both as an elite netballer and as a person – so to gain the official title of Vice Captain off the back of her peers’ recommendations is really special.

“While Tara is new to our Lightning environment, she has leadership characteristics in spades and that immediately resonated with the playing group and coaches. And the work she has put into her rehabilitation and now reintegration to the group has been incredible.

“We also felt it was really important to recognise Karla as part of this group, albeit from afar in South Africa - as a foundation player she has such knowledge and experience to share and is still one of our key leaders.”

Wood said she felt privileged to be voted Captain by her peers for the 2022 season.

“It really is an honour to be named Captain of Sunshine Coast Lightning and it’s a responsibility that I don’t take lightly,” Wood said.

“We’ve worked really hard this pre-season and I feel this group has so much untapped potential and upside and it’s my role to help get the best out of each of them.”

Foundation player Scherian was humbled by the opportunity to join the leadership group and believes she can lead by example.

“A formal leadership title wasn’t something I openly sought out but I’m definitely grateful, this club is truly special to be a part of and this particular playing group is so exciting and carries so much potential,” Scherian said.

Tara Hinchliffe said being named co-Vice Captain just emphasized how welcomed she has felt since joining Lightning and cannot wait for the season to start.

“To be embraced by my teammates so quickly is amazing and now it’s up to me to give back both on on and off the court,” Hinchliffe said.

Club CEO Danielle Smith said the new-look leadership group will represent Lightning admirably and congratulated each of Wood, Hinchliffe and Scherian on their appointment.

“We’ve seen Steph excel on the international stage and for Lightning over the past five years, so to see her officially named Captain is a real proud moment,” Smith said.

“I feel this is an excellent mix of leaders who will help take our Club forward on the court, as well as continue to grow our reputation as an elite sporting Club with a strong community focus.”

Sunshine Coast Council has been a partner with the Lightning since the club's inception.
