Construction progress is continuing on the Brisbane Road Upgrade, part of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade Project.

The Brisbane Road, Foote Street and Tarcoola Avenue intersection roundabout will be upgraded to a signalised intersection helping to improve traffic movements and enhance safety at this busy location.

Extensive underground services works, including telecommunications, mains water, sewer and stormwater, have been undertaken along Brisbane Road and surrounding streets. Construction continues on the new, four-lane Mayes Canal Bridge.

**Watch the video to see the progress.**

Council will continue to make every effort to minimise impacts to the local community and businesses during construction and thanks the community for patience during this major project.

This project is improving connectivity and travel choices in the heart of Mooloolaba and will benefit pedestrians, cyclists, motorists and public transport users.
