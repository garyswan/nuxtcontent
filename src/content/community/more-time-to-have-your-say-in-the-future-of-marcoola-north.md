Running out of time to take part in the Marcoola North Placemaking Project? No need to worry about missing out, the community consultation survey has been extended!

Council is committed to undertaking thorough community engagement for this project while also keeping our community and staff safe – our highest priority.

Due to the current COVID-19 health risks, the scheduled community consultation event at the Saturday Morning Farmers Market on 15 January 2022 has been cancelled.

However, community input is important and to ensure we receive as much feedback as possible, council has extended the survey’s closing date to Friday, 21 January.

You can find more Marcoola North Foreshore Placemaking project information and complete our online survey via council’s Have Your Say page: [Marcoola North Foreshore Placemaking Project](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mnfp)
.

If you have any queries about the project, you can also email the project team at placemaking\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au before 21 January.
