The season of giving is now upon us, and Sunshine Coast residents are encouraged to give the gift of the love of reading to vulnerable families though the Books4Kids initiative.

Now in its 23rd year the Sunshine Coast Libraries-run initiative has distributed more than 11,000 books to children and teenagers via local charities.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the initiative was aimed at gifting books to young people and families doing it tough.

“This year, Sunshine Coast Libraries is aiming to double donations received due to the increase in hardship experienced by our local community,” Cr Law said.

“For families experiencing hardship, receiving a gift on Christmas day means the world, and a book can make a young person’s world that much brighter and bigger.

“From picture books with heart-warming tales and captivating illustrations, junior fiction filled with humour and action, non-fiction brimming with dinosaurs or bugs or young adult stories of fantasy and friendship, a book donation can share joy in a profound and meaningful way.

“Research tells us that access to books in the family home can increase a child’s awareness and comprehension, help develop language skills, expand their vocabulary and foster interactive connections with loved ones.

“If you’re in a positive position this year, please pass it on and donate to the appeal to inspire the love of reading in our littlest minds.”

Unwrapped donations of newly purchased children’s or young adult books will be welcomed at any Sunshine Coast Library between now and December 13.
