Maroochydore Football Club will welcome 500 junior boys and girls from regional and South East Queensland for the 2021 Football Queensland Community Cup this September.

After several upgrades these past few years including seating, shade structures, floodlights and female change room facilities, the complex at Kuluin is well equipped to host this five-day event from 20 to 24 September.

Aligning with our vision to be known as one of Australia's premier sports training destinations and a great host of major sporting events and teams, this is a new sports development event for our event calendar.

Sponsored by Council through the Major Events Sponsorship Program, it also presents a real opportunity for event visitors to sight-see and explore all of our natural assets and attractions while they are here for the five days.

For more information please contact the [Maroochydore Football Club](http://maroochydorefc.com.au/)
