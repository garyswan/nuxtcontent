Vital community spaces, exciting facility upgrades and a range of hinterland improvements are coming to Division 10 thanks to Sunshine Coast Council’s 2023-24 Budget.

“Road upgrades, park and footpath improvements and a change room design for the Nambour Yandina United Football Club are among the Sunshine Coast Council 2023-24 Budget highlights for Division 10,” Cr Law said.

“Council is committed to continuing to support the Nambour economy and is investing $3 million in Council’s Nambour Administration Precinct.

“Another $1.68 million will be invested in the Nambour Namba Place revitalisation design, encouraging additional economic and social uplift to this hinterland town.

“The 14.5 hectare recreational, sporting and events facility, the Nambour Showgrounds, will be receiving an exciting boost, which includes, entry plaza concept design, Jim Carolan Pavilion and Ray Grace Pavilion upgrades and undertaking the detailed design of an amenity upgrade.

“Thanks to State and Federal Government funding, upgrades at the Nambour Showgrounds will also include an improved PA system.

“These upgrades focus on improving the facility, which is important for the longevity of this major asset for the community.

“Our hiking enthusiasts will have even more reason to visit our region’s open spaces with Kirbys Road Environment Reserve receiving construction of a new carpark and composting toilet in Obi Obi and Cilento Park in Nambour getting a trail renewal and signage.

“Park upgrades don’t stop there, with construction on the footbridge in Quota Memorial Park helping to improve the connection between the playground equipment and dog park.”

Cr Law said Division 10 playgrounds would be receiving upgrades to ensure young people could continue to play, run and have fun in their local parks in Eumundi, Gheerulla, Kenilworth, Mapleton, Nambour, North Arm.

“Following community consultation last year, the first stage of works for North Arm Park are set to kick off with our little ones benefiting with the park receiving upgraded play equipment,” Cr Law said.
