The countdown is on to the Sunshine Coast’s biggest sculpture festival from 20 November to 4 December at the hinterland, and the voluntary team behind it are preparing to welcome thousands of visitors to experience and enjoy a record-breaking number of artworks.

In its 12th year now, Sculpture on the Edge is managed by Arts Connect Inc. and will be hosted this year at a new venue, Flaxton Gardens.

Exhibition Venue - Flaxton Gardens, Maleny

President of Arts Connect Inc, Gretchen Keelty, is excited that moving to Flaxton Gardens’ expansive site enables more space to showcase more than 140 sculptures across a variety of media and that this year’s entries include artists from throughout Australia and from as far away as Spain.

“We’ve dreamed of expanding the competition and this year features indoor and open air works ranging from micro-works to large sculptural pieces placed throughout the picturesque grounds; it’s also enabled us to add more workshops, artist talks, public events and the inaugural Sculpted Dinner – an extraordinary feast for all the senses!”

“We’ve been thrilled with the number of business supporters who have come forward to donate prize money and sponsorship for the competition, especially our host venue Flaxton Gardens as major sponsor of the $10,000 first prize for the overall winning artist,” Gretchen said.

“Artists awards will be announced on the opening night of 19 November, all but the People’s Choice Award to be announced at the Closing Party. The free exhibition will open to the public to visit from 9am to 3pm every day for 2 weeks, closing on Sunday 4 December.”

“This is a year of many firsts, and the exhibition will be a truly magical experience for visitors of all ages, so we hope that local people will also join in alongside the thousands of visitors to our region that this annual event attracts.”

Tickets are selling quickly now online for the Official Opening event, closing night party and for The Sculpted Dinner to be held at Flaxton Gardens on Saturday 26 November from 6pm.
