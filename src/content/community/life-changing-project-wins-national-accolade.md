A clever project that makes it easier for people to get out and enjoy life on the Sunshine Coast has gained national recognition.

The region’s new [mobility maps](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Access-inclusion-and-disability/Mobility-mapping)
&#x20;have been recognised by the Australian Government.

The initiative was among 11 category winners in the coveted [2022 National Awards for Local Government](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories-regions-cities/local-government/national-awards-local-government)
.

This year’s winners were praised for “creating stronger, more cohesive communities’’.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the high-profile awards highlighted innovative and resourceful projects that made a difference.

“The maps are making life easier for people of all abilities, from mums and dads with toddlers in tow to the elderly, people using wheelchairs and mobility aids,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This award is another incredible achievement for council that would not have been possible without the dedication and service of the Design and Placemaking team, our Geographic Information System team, as well as our partnership with Briometrix – a leading provider of technology solutions for people with disabilities.

“This project is another significant step in making our region accessible and inclusive for everyone.”

The National Awards for Local Government are an annual celebration of the best Australian local government achievements.

Member for Eden-Monaro and Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, the Hon Kristy McBain MP, was proud to congratulate all category winners and commend all nominees for this year’s National Awards for Local Government.

“The high standard of entries this year is a testament to the hard work of local governments who have ensured positive, quality outcomes are achieved in their communities nationwide,” Mrs McBain said.

“The tireless efforts of our local governments to overcome barriers faced this year such as floods, bushfires and COVID-19, and develop new initiatives that deliver remarkable outcomes for their communities, are incredible.

“The winners of this year’s awards have undoubtedly created stronger, more cohesive communities, from ensuring ongoing collaboration with Indigenous Australians right through to reducing road injuries and fatalities by adopting new road safety technology."

The Mobility Maps project came about as a trial to test new techniques to assist community members with limited mobility or people with a short-term injury, to move around the Sunshine Coast by providing access to maps and wayfinding information about accessible routes.
