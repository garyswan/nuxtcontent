One of the most consistent surf breaks on the Sunshine Coast is fringed by a grassy beachfront and popular parkland, which is a delight for locals and visitors alike.

Backed by a shopping and entertainment strip and fronting the sparkling foam of Coolum Beach are Lions Park and Norrie Job Park, two adjacent parks located off David Low Way.

The seaside favourites are about to be revamped to enhance the opportunities in the parks even more.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said that following previous community engagement, our community could now provide **[further feedback](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/lions-and-norrie-job-park-landscape-plan)
** on the landscape plan’s design.

“Not many of us know, but this popular Coolum park is actually two parks, with the eastern portion of the open space named after Norrie Job, an office bearer with the Coolum Surf Lifesaving club who worked to promote and develop the club in the 1930s.

“Then there is Lions Park adjacent to Council’s Coolum Beach Holiday Park and the iconic surf beach.

“This important green space, between the beach and the road, needs a freshen up to make it more welcoming and accessible for all our community.

“I would like to thank park users, residents, businesses, and visitors for participating in two rounds of community engagement in 2016 and 2022 and working with council to develop a shared landscape plan.

“The planned upgrade will be staged over several years and reflects Coolum’s ‘unplugged’ way of life – and we want to hear what you think before April 3 by completing the **[online survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/lions-and-norrie-job-park-landscape-plan)
.**

“The design aims to balance nature, recreation and leisure with a range of opportunities for exercise, play, relaxation and social activities in a preserved natural environment.”

The parks, together with Tickle Park, provide a council-wide recreation function, supported by district level recreation parks such as Jack Morgan Park at Coolum and others in Marcoola, Mudjimba and Peregian Springs.

The community is encouraged to provide feedback on the landscape plan between March 13 and April 3 by visiting council’s **[Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/lions-and-norrie-job-park-landscape-plan)
**. Simply google “Have your say Sunshine Coast” for a list of landscape plan features and more information.
