Attention book worms and literary lovers, if you’ve been looking for a book club to join Sunshine Coast Libraries one just for you.

Our new online book club Ben’s Book Club is hosted by best-selling Snake Island author [Ben Hobson](https://www.benhobson.net/)

This month we are reading [The Mother by Jane Caro](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=867488)
