If you’re chasing family friendly fun in the sun, look no further than the Coastal Pathway.

The 73 km spectacular coastal pathway runs from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

Walk, jog, cycle, skate or scoot along the pathway while taking in the sights and sounds of the beautiful coastline.

Take a break and relax at one of the many beaches, lookouts, playgrounds, cafes or parks.

There are plenty of shady places to picnic with barbecues along the way, shopping and activities to entertain the kids - including awesome skate parks.

There really is something for everyone!

To help plan your Coastal Pathway adventures council has created a [guide](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
, splitting the pathway into 9 connecting sections:  

*   **Coolum Connection**

*Coolum Beach to Point Arkwright - 5.6km.*\
Coolum is a tourist hotspot with beaches and playgrounds right across the road from shopping and dining. Pick up some lunch and take a short ride to the lookouts at Point Perry or Point Arkwright. Don’t forget your binoculars – you might even spot some turtles or whales.

*   **Marcoola Connection**

*Point Arkwright to Mudjimba Beach - 8.5km.*\
This section of the coastal pathway through Marcoola is a family favourite. Dive into nature as you explore this peaceful stretch of coastline on the wide shady path. Pause at one of the many lookouts and immerse yourself in the ocean sounds and smells.    

*   **Maroochy River Connection**

*Mudjimba Beach to Cotton Tree - 12km.*\
The pathway moves away from the coast for most of this connection, passing through Twin Waters before reaching the vast Maroochy River. Enjoy river views all the way from the bridge to Picnic Point. Explore the natural beauty of Chambers Island or stop at Ocean Street for your choice of cafes and restaurants.   

*   **Maroochydore Connection**

\_Cotton Tree to Mooloolaba Beach - 4.4km.\
\_Cotton Tree is famous for its vast treelined park, calm waters, and relaxed dining. The pathway hugs the water all the way to Mooloolaba with plenty of opportunities to take a swim, play at a playground or dine along the way. Stroll to the Mooloolaba Spit and take in the spectacular view while you enjoy some local fish and chips.

*   **Mooloolaba Connection**

*Mooloolaba Beach to Buddina Beach - 5.5km.*\
After visiting vibrant Mooloolaba, the pathway heads inland to navigate the Mooloolah River. Stop on the separated cycleway for a picnic or a spot of fishing under the Mayes Canal Bridge. Discover the natural wonders of Point Cartwright on the scenic loop from Buddina Beach.

*   **Kawana Connection**

*Buddina Beach to Currimundi Beach - 14.5km.*\
Perfect for families, this pathway hugs the coastline through tree-lined dunes with the sound of the ocean at every turn. Pause to take in the views, try the new playground at Bokarina Beach or explore the calm waters of Currimundi Lake.

*   **Currimundi Connection**

*Currimundi Beach to Moffat Beach - 3.2km.*\
The peaceful natural beauty of this section of pathway will bring you back time and time again. After relaxing at Currimundi Lake, explore the shady coastal bushland reserve and boardwalk heading south, great on a hot day. Dicky Beach is great for a casual bite to eat and a swim.     

*   **Caloundra Connection**

*Moffat Beach to Bulcock Beach - 4.5km.*\
Caloundra is famous for its beautiful beaches, amenities, cafes and events. Stop for coffee at one of the many beachside cafes or a swim. The pathway follows the cliffs so you can spot turtles, whales or just enjoy the ocean views.

*   **Pumicestone Connection**

\_Bulcock Beach to Bells Creek - 6km.\_Sheltered from the ocean swell by Bribie Island, the calm Pumicestone Passage is perfect for a family ride with lots of places to relax. The Golden Beach foreshore boasts picnic areas, playgrounds and is a popular fishing and boating spot.
