After a challenging year for many, especially volunteer groups, it's time to come back together again for the Volunteer of the Year Awards, hosted by Volunteering Sunshine Coast on Saturday May 29.

This special FREE event will feature keynote speaker Amanda Gore.

We'll also have the opportunity to recognise those who go above and beyond, who are passionate about helping people and making a positive change within our wonderful Sunshine Coast community.

Tickets are FREE and available now through Volunteering Sunshine Coast's [website](https://www.volunteeringsunshinecoast.org.au/)
.
