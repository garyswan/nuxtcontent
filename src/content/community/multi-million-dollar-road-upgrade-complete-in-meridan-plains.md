A $17.6 million congestion-busting road upgrade is complete clearing the path for a smoother school run and daily commute on Parklands Boulevard, Meridan Plains.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was pleased the 18 month construction project was complete, with Council delivering this important infrastructure for the community in partnership with the Queensland Government.

“This has been a complex project in which it has been essential that the works were undertaken in a way that allowed road users and the community, the local college and business centres to continue to function without major disruption or delay,” Mayor Jamieson said.

 “Council has invested $16.9 million into this upgrade which has provided the Meridan Plains community with a new four-lane section of Parklands Boulevard between Sunset Drive and Meridan Way.

"Safe efficient transport is a key lifestyle factor so our residents can travel where they need to go and return home safely."

“Safe efficient transport is a key lifestyle factor so our residents can travel where they need to go and return home safely.

“This upgrade improves safety and travel time for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians by improving traffic flow, reducing delays during peak periods and catering for future traffic volumes.”

Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said this major project has been genuinely appreciated by the Meridan Plains community, especially commuters during school drop off and pick up times.

“I’ve watched the delays and experienced the pain first hand, so I’m delighted that we have completed this road upgrade that’s increasing the capacity, safety and reducing travel time – whether you’re a motorist, cyclist or pedestrian.

“I’ve received feedback from parents that the school drop-off and pick-ups have been a lot smoother, taking the headache out of the morning and afternoon school runs to the nearby Meridan State College with around 2700 students.

"I want to thank nearby residents, local businesses, Meridan State College and the wider community for their patience... while we delivered these much needed works.”

“I want to thank nearby residents, local businesses, Meridan State College and the wider community for their patience and cooperation with construction teams during the past 18 months while we delivered these much needed works.”

The project also features new dedicated cycle lanes adjacent to the traffic lanes and new signalised pedestrian crossings at the Sunset Drive and Meridan Way intersections. Shared pathways have been installed on both sides of Parklands Boulevard.

The project forms part of the Sunshine Coast Council’s capital works program to provide for the current and future transport needs of the Caloundra area.

Sunshine Coast Council committed $16.9 million towards this project, augmented with a grant of $750,000 from the State Government’s Cycle Network Local Government Grants**.**

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey welcomed the improved pedestrian and cyclist facilities around the busy school drop off area.

“With a major school, aquatic centre, tavern and many local businesses located around this section of Parklands Boulevard, it was imperative that any upgrade to improve congestion also seek to improve safety for pedestrians and bike riders,” Mr Bailey said.

“Meridan Plains has grown substantially over the past 15 years and council is to be congratulated for not only delivering better local roads but also building infrastructure for the local community.”
