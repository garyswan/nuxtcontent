The Sunshine Coast’s longest established business awards have been celebrating business success since 1995 and are managed by the Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance and sponsored by Sunshine Coast Council, bringing a stronger, region-wide focus to the prestigious awards.

The Sunshine Coast Business Awards recognises the many, impressive business success stories throughout the region, and provides exceptional networking events for the local business community throughout the year.

The awards program culminates in the major gala event held in November and attended by 600 people from all corners of our business community. This is a networking event not to be missed on the Sunshine Coast calendar!
