Children and those young at heart are expected to flock to the Maleny Show this month (28-29 May) as the hinterland’s best in agriculture and entertainment goes on display at the Maleny Showgrounds.

Monster trucks and fireworks, horse and cattle events, cooking competitions and, of course, dagwood dogs ready to be devoured, are all part of the line-up for the family friendly event.  

Maleny Show Society Secretary Lois White said the committee had been working non-stop since February to make this year’s show a reality, which was cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“As soon as our COVID Safe Plan was approved in February we decided to go ahead with it to give all of our competitors a chance to compete in the things they haven’t been able to for such a long time,” Ms White said.

“We see ourselves as a genuine community service for many community groups to get involved in, such as Rotary, Lions, CWA, cricket and tennis clubs, and people young and old to have a wonderful time.

“This year all pavilion sections such as photography, woodwork and cooking categories can be entered online and across two evenings we’ll have the monster trucks, KC fireworks, plus novelty horse and car events.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged local residents to show their support and pre-purchase tickets online.

“Sunshine Coast families are very fortunate to have the opportunity to enjoy the Maleny Show this year and it will certainly be one not to be missed,” Cr Law said.

“Connected communities turn into thriving communities which makes up the social fabric of our society and is a key goal of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

“If you can, please make time to support the Maleny Show and remember to be COVID Safe at all times. This includes maintaining social distancing, washing your hands often and please stay home if you’re unwell and get tested if you have any COVID symptoms.”    

Tickets to the Maleny Show start from $5 for children and $15 for adults.

Parking on site will be very limited so visitors are encouraged to make use of free shuttle buses from the Maleny Historical Village and Maleny High School running from 8am until late. Disabled parking is available on site.
