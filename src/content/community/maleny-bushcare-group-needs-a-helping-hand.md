The Maleny Showgrounds Bushcare group are looking for some helping hands to join them once a month to protect and restore the original subtropical rainforest of the Blackall Range.

Group volunteer Kent Hutton said it was rewarding to be a member of such a passionate group of people.

"Working with environmentally minded people is a great way to learn and work with others, to achieve a common goal within our local community," Mr Hutton said.

"To improve a location either by weeding or planting of an area that was once degraded, is a great outcome of the groupâ€™s work.

"It is very satisfying seeing something that is improved and special for the ecology of our area.

"It would be hoped that the broader community who witness our work, will either join us or look to improve their patch as well."

Working bees take place on the second Sunday of each month, with the next date being Sunday June 12, 2022. The group meet from 8.30 to 11.30am at the Maleny Showgrounds, Stanley River Road, Maleny.

The community is invited to come along once a month for some great conversations and laughter and contribute to restoring the original rainforest of the area.

The group is made of local Maleny community members who are passionate about environmental issues and undertake bush regeneration projects on their own properties.

In 2021, together 18 of these amazing volunteers achieved 200 hours of volunteer time; planted 151 stems and removed 30 wheelie bins of weeds.
