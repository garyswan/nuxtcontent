This little teddy has been handed in to our Customer Contact Centre at Caloundra and, while it has been a pleasure showing Ted the ropes, we'd now like to reunite him with his (or her) family.

Heâ€™s been having a blast with our team and, as you can see, has been working really hard, but now it's way past his bed time!

We believe Ted got lost in the park adjacent to our Caloundra building - Bill Venardos Park - during an event or gathering before he was handed to us on April 13.

Do you know who might be missing their teddy?

If you know where Ted lives can you please phone our Customer Contact Centre and let us know you've seen him on Facebook and it's time to come home? 5475 7272.
