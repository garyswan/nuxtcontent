More than 10,000 shrubs and groundcovers plus 120 trees have been planted at Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland, earning the project a major gong for environmental responsibility and ‘greening’ the built landscape.

Sunshine Coast Council’s new community parkland project has been recognised by the Australian Institute of Horticulture Inc (AIH) with the Green Space Urban Award.

The judges made special mention of the management and protection of the iconic Norfolk pines and native vegetation within the site during the construction period.

Tree protection zones were created along with specialist animal habitat rehabilitation along the Mooloolaba Esplanade embankment.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the award highlighted council’s commitment to preserving and enhancing our natural and urban environments.

“Council’s vision is to be Australia’s most sustainable region and the preservation and enhancement of our green space plays a big role in that,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It’s a great honour to be recognised by AIH for the first stage of this world-class community parkland project.

“The Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation is a prime example of how we are building for the future while also sustaining the important natural assets we value most.

“The team has done a wonderful job preserving the landscape here at the Northern Parkland.

“Not only have they included more than 10,000 plants, they have also removed invasive, noxious weeds, predominantly the Singapore Daisy and Pepper Tree.

“The new boardwalk has received overwhelming positive community feedback and I’m proud the Northern Parkland has been specially designed for our residents and visitors of all abilities – a high priority for this council.”

Mooloolaba's Northern Parkland.

AIH President Michael Casey said it was a pleasure to present the Green Space Award in person at Mooloolaba today (June 3) following the cancellation of the [2021 AIH award](https://www.aih.org.au/awards-2021/)
&#x20;ceremony due to Covid-19 restrictions.

“The Australian Institute of Horticulture recognises the commitment, professionalism and excellence of those who have made a significant contribution to the horticultural industry,” Mr Casey said.

“I’m thrilled to present the Green Space Urban Award for this signature project and congratulate all those involved, including the Sunshine Coast Council team, Murphy Builders, Arboractive and the Queensland State Government for contributing vital funding.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland was befitting of Australia’s most sustainable region and would no doubt further enhance the community’s natural, healthy and active way of life on the Sunshine Coast.

“I consider this to be one of the most incredible parklands in our region and I am thrilled our community will soon be able to enjoy the new community space when it opens in late June,” Cr Natoli said.

The project’s consulting arborist/horticulturist David Hawthorne of Arboractive was also commended for his work on the project.

The Northern Parkland is the first stage of the multimillion dollar, multi-stage [Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Mooloolaba-Foreshore-Revitalisation-Project)
. 

The transformation boasts impressive native and subtropical gardens, new barbecue shelters, new public toilets, a new playground and a 430-metre boardwalk linking Alex Bluff to the foreshore.

When all stages of the foreshore revitalisation are complete, public beachfront parkland in Mooloolaba will be increased by 40 per cent.

Great consideration was given to the landscape design which features a tapestry of sinuous curves to mirror that of Mooloolaba’s natural coastline.

The Stage One Northern Parkland was developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package in association with Sunshine Coast Council. 

Sunshine Coast Council has committed $6.9 million towards Stage One Northern Parkland and is proud to have local firms design and deliver this new community precinct.
