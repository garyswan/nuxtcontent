A passionate team of Nambour business and community groups have been working together to build some great digital assets to promote living, working, shopping and exploring Nambour.

Developed to encourage locals and visitors to explore Nambour, the digital makeover includes dynamic #ExploreNambour video series, e-newsletter, blogs, social media content, and a revamp of the [I AM NAMBOUR](https://iamnambour.com.au/nambour/)
&#x20;website.

The innovative new video series captures the vibrant night economy, and the varied shopping and café culture, including Nambour’s highly regarded vintage shopping offering.

The website now includes newly created [Parking Map](https://iamnambour.com.au/nambour-parking-map/)
&#x20;and [Vintage and Retro Op Shop Hip Hop Map](https://iamnambour.com.au/op-shop-hip-hop-map/)
, plus up-to-date small business and local industry content, links to investment information and destination marketing information.

The benefits of the upgraded digital maps and promotional material are two-fold, offering increased sustainability and a much broader promotional reach for our Nambour community.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said these investments were a positive step towards revitalising Nambour’s town centre.

“Both residents and visitors to Nambour now have a fresh, functioning website with access to information on local events, maps, arts, local business and importantly investor pathways to strengthen the region and really open up the Gateway to the Hinterland,” Mayor Jamieson said.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said Nambour was one of the first experiences visitors had of the Sunshine Coast.

“As a gateway precinct, these upgrades are an important step in servicing the needs of the growing town, local businesses and surrounding communities,” Cr Law said.

“The parking maps provide helpful options including all day parking, customer parking, paid parking and wheelchair parking.

“Nambour has a flourishing retro and vintage scene to explore and now 17 of the popular destinations are a click away for shoppers on a handy digital map.”

*I am Nambour Ambassador - Rhonda Billett.*

Local business owner and Nambour Ambassador Rhonda Billett said she was pleased with the support provided by Sunshine Coast Council and Visit Sunshine Coast.

“We now have a website packed full of local events, places to explore in Nambour, things to see and do, digital assets for local business and links for future business investors to help our local hinterland economy evolve and thrive,” Ms Billett said.

The [I AM NAMBOUR](https://iamnambour.com.au/nambour/)
&#x20;website is just one of the many initiatives taking place in Nambour, which is redefining itself as a heritage, arts and music hub.

Council is also leading the design of the [Nambour (Namba) Place Revitalisation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Nambour-Centre-Activation-Project/Nambour-Place-Revitalisation-Project)
&#x20;which aims to develop a precinct-wide strategy for Nambour’s town centre to consolidate its growing reputation as a creative and welcoming place.  

Plans to significantly upgrade the Nambour Administration Building into a new modern library, community meeting spaces, and council administration offices, are underway.

The monthly Nambour Forecourt Live! event is jointly presented by Council and Peace Run Records – supporting local businesses and artists with live music and food on the last Friday of each month.

Council has collaborated with Nambour Chamber of Commerce, Nambour Tram Way Company, Reimagine Nambour, Nambour Retailers Group and Visit Sunshine Coast on this initiative. For more information visit <https://iamnambour.com.au/>
