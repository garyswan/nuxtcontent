Brilliant minds from numerous Sunshine Coast schools will now move on to the next stage of the Mayor’s Telstra Innovation Awards competition, with student mentoring by local entrepreneurs to begin in the coming weeks.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson confirmed 10 teams from five schools delivered an interesting field of forward-thinking projects for the competition this year.

“Our high-value industries including health and wellbeing, education and research, knowledge industries, food and agribusiness, clean technologies and aviation are a major focus of our [Regional Economic Development Strategy for 2019-2023](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Regional-Economic-Development-Strategy-2013-to-2033)
,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Tackling big topic ideas such as affordable housing, sustainable transport, water quality and diabetes are some of the projects pitched and could one day enhance capabilities in any of those high value industries thanks to these young leaders,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Whether or not they got through to the next stage, we should pay kudos to these students for their initiative, thinking and confidence to participate in programs like this.

“I wish all of the finalists’ good luck as they head into Phase 2 of the Mayor's Telstra Innovation Awards.”

Phase 2 will give the teams an opportunity to further develop their technological idea or concept with help from some of the best entrepreneurs and technical experts in the region.

Finalists will participate in a series of four mentoring sessions to be held at Venue 114, Bokarina, focusing on practical skill and knowledge development specific to the start-up, entrepreneur and technological space.
