The removalist van is booked and we’re ready to move.

The Maroochydore Customer Service counter and Development Information counter is moving from 10 First Avenue, Maroochydore, to the new Sunshine Coast City Hall on December 12, alongside many other council departments.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said the new location was a short, walk from the current Customer Service counter at 10 First Avenue, Maroochydore.

“We understand some Sunshine Coast residents prefer to communicate with us in person so we made sure the new Maroochydore Customer Service counter was just down the road and in a central, convenient and accessible location,” Cr Dickson said.

“Though our Maroochydore location has changed, there will be no change to the services we provide.

“We’ve put measures in place to ensure a seamless transition that does not impact our service to the community.

“Though we officially move on December 12, there will be a transition period where the Customer Service counter will remain open at the First Avenue location for one week, until Friday, December 16. 

“We look forward to welcoming you to our new abode but if you’re unable to visit us in person or you prefer to chat online, there are plenty of ways to so.

“You can contact council over the phone (with a free call back), text message, email or online via our website or Facebook direct message.

“Nambour and Caloundra Customer Service counters will continue operating.”
