Sunshine Coast locals moved at pace to secure tickets to a one-night-only author event with Ash Barty on Wednesday, November 2.

Celebrating the launch of her memoir*, My Dream Time: A memoir of tennis and teamwork*, the sold-out event will see Ash reflect on her incredible personal and professional journey, looking back on moments that have brought her to where she is today.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the demand for the event proved just how much the region loved its home-grown authors and our nation’s sporting legends.

“Ash is one of Australia’s greatest sportspeople and this event will present a rare opportunity to discover how she rose from obscurity – and hardship - to tennis stardom,” Cr Law said.

“With her signature humility and commitment, Ash has become a role model for many, so it’s no wonder the event sold out within 72 hours.

“Sunshine Coast Libraries are renowned for hosting some of Australia’s favourite and newest writing talents so if you’ve missed out on tickets this time, I urge you to subscribe to Libraries eNews to be the first to find out about future events.

“I can’t yet share the name of our next special guest however it will include a bestselling author with a top-rating podcast and will be announced on Monday November 7.”

Previous sold-out author events hosted by Sunshine Coast Libraries have featured Trent Dalton, Mia Freedman, Peter FitzSimons, Di Morrissey,  Lisa Curry and Turia Pitt.
