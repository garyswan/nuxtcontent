We have the expertise and the know-how to produce world standard products and some of the Sunshine Coast’s best in their fields have now had the chance to showcase their goods and services to the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games leaders.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson thanked the Games Board for visiting the region over the past two days and experiencing all the future host region had to offer.

“We’ve enjoyed hosting the Board, showing them the best of the Sunshine Coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We’ve taken them to our premium sporting venues, shown them iconic beaches and green spaces, and also given them a literal taste of the local industry, including produce from Mooloolaba, which is home to Australia’s largest and most sustainable fishery.

“The Olympic and Paralympic Games give us an opportunity to put our region’s industries on show in a way that’s never been done before, demonstrating that we have the expertise and capacity to produce goods and services at a global standard.

“We have an opportunity to develop a legacy-driven focus anchored in sustainability, connectivity and liveability for the Sunshine Coast and our neighbouring regions.

“I look forward to continuing our work with the Board and Games Delivery Partners along with our whole community as we come together to develop the Legacy Plan.”

It comes as around 500 of Australia’s community and business leaders, sports stars, school leaders and Games representatives will come together in February at the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum to shape the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games Legacy Plan.

The Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum was announced by the Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk at the Board meeting on the Sunshine Coast, where Brisbane 2032 leaders explained how all Australians will have the opportunity to get involved in the legacy planning process.

Work has been underway since the host announcement to deliver a strategy for legacy planning. The Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum begins a broader community consultation phase to hear from a wide cross-section of the Australian community.

Queenslanders and Australians will be invited to have their say by sending a message about their hopes and dreams for 2032 and beyond to the delegates attending the forum. Each delegate will also be asked to engage their own communities prior to the event. 

The Legacy Forum will invite Australia’s best, brightest and boldest minds to help develop a draft vision for the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan, giving life to the legacy aspirations outlined in the Response to the Future Host Questionnaire (the candidature).

The draft vision, draft themes and series of priorities developed at the Legacy Forum will then be released for public consultation for two months. From March to May 2023, children, adults, First Nations peoples, and sporting and community groups will be asked to provide their ideas on how the legacy plan can deliver lasting benefits to Brisbane, Queensland and Australia, leading up to, during and after the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Consultation will include an online hub, engagement activities and workshops that ensure people from every corner of the State and beyond can have their say.

The Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan will define how we take advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games platform over a 10+10+ year period to drive economic, social, cultural and built environment opportunities that ensure lasting benefits before, during and after the Games.

A key focus of the Brisbane 2032 Board meeting was a legacy planning workshop for Board members and senior leaders across all levels of Government, led by Queensland Minister for Tourism, Innovation and Sport, and Minister Assisting the Premier on Olympics and Paralympics Sport and Engagement Stirling Hinchliffe.

Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson and Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate were also invited to participate in the Board legacy workshop, acknowledging the critical roles the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast will play in delivering Brisbane 2032, and the subsequent potential for generating legacy opportunities in the regions.

The Board workshop is one of the first steps in the consultation process to define the vision, themes and objectives that will form part of the legacy plan.

The Board meeting followed a day of board members touring Olympic and Paralympic Games venues and local businesses on the Sunshine Coast where directors heard from local community members, First Nations peoples, local Olympian and Paralympians and industry representatives about their aspirations for Brisbane 2032.

The President and his fellow directors met with representatives from the Kabi Kabi and Jinibara peoples, the Sunshine Coast Council Legacy Plan Community Reference Group members, Brisbane 2032 venues managers, and key local industry leaders such as Walker Seafoods and Sunshine Coast Airport.

The Brisbane 2032 Board meeting on the Sunshine Coast is the first of many to be held in the regions, reflecting the new format of Olympic and Paralympic Games to be hosted across numerous cities and towns, broadening the opportunity for participation, economic growth and community engagement in the movement.

The next Brisbane 2032 Board meeting is expected to be held in March next year on the Gold Coast.
