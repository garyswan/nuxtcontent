A host of Sunshine Coast representatives have been called on to shape a “big, bold legacy vision” for the 2023 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic games.

The group was invited to take part in the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum in Brisbane, which aims to ensure the benefits of the coveted international showcase stretch well beyond the 29 days of competition.

Flying the flag for our region were Mayor Mark Jamieson, who played a crucial role in attracting the event to South East Queensland, 2032 Sunshine Coast Legacy Plan Community Reference Group (CRG) members Dr Bridie Kean, Chris van der Pol, Peter Saba, Skye Parker, Mark Henricks, Michelle Phillips and Ashley Robinson, Sunshine Coast 2032 Taskforce representative Duncan Armstrong, Jinibara Traditional Custodian Zeitha Jalamala Murphy, Kabi Kabi Traditional Custodian Brian Warner, Young Citizen of the Year Mason Hope-Kassulke, Youth Council members Agnes Jain and Gunter Nolle and Youth World Championship athlete Taylah Stephens.

Mayor Jamieson said Sunshine Coast Council had been on the journey to secure the 2032 Games since early 2015.

“That’s why I’m thrilled to be part of this forum alongside some amazing Sunshine Coast community delegates, including Australian wheelchair basketball player and two-time Paralympian Dr Bridie Kean, and our Young Citizen of the Year Mason Hope-Kassulke,” he said.

“Our delegates were selected to be a voice for the broader Sunshine Coast community in the areas of sport, education, business, inclusion, tourism, sustainability, arts, First Nations, and youth.

“We would be selling our community short if we did not seek to maximise every opportunity afforded from our involvement in the 2032 Games.

“This forum is an important step in securing a positive legacy for our Sunshine Coast.”

Five hundred of Australia’s best, brightest and boldest minds including community and business leaders, sports stars and youth representatives will gathered at the forum to help shape the legacy vision and priorities.

Almost 12,000 ideas were gathered through the three-month national Hopes and Dreams survey campaign will also form part of the discussion at the forum.

People of all ages, from under 18 to over 80 responded to the survey, from every state and territory in Australia, as well as a number from overseas including Japan and France.

Ideas submitted included the environment, infrastructure, sport and physical activity, First Nations people and culture, transport, health and wellbeing, community connections, jobs and the economy, innovation and technology, diversity, equality and inclusion.

#### Other submissions include:

*   Revitalised first nation language in schools and at Opening Ceremony;
*   Free sport for every child;
*   Modular athlete village that can be rezoned to residential;
*   6G connectivity;
*   Paperless Games;
*   An Olympic housing trust;
*   Creating a state that is easy to visit for people with disability, no matter where they are from and how they move;
*   Building world-standard and inclusive sporting infrastructure we can be proud of.

These ideas, along with ideas raised by the 500 Legacy Forum delegates, will be collated and analysed to help inform the draft vision, themes and series of priorities.

Queenslanders and Australians will have the opportunity to provide feedback on these during public consultation in April and May 2023 before the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan is developed and released later in 2023.
