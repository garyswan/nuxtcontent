Share your favourite photos of summers past to enter Sunshine Coast Council’s 2022 Heritage Calendar photo competition.

The competition is open July 26 to August 16. Entry is free and winning photos will be included in the calendar.

The 2022 calendar theme, ‘*The Great Outdoors…Celebrating fun days of sun and adventure’*, will showcase a mix of images – from camping out in the hinterland, to hiking, spending lazy days at the beach, a drive in the country or perhaps flying high above our beautiful region.

Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the annual heritage calendar provided a perfect opportunity to showcase those curious aspects of our region’s history, often hidden in personal photo collections.

“This is the eighth year we have reached out to our community to feature photos from their experience of our region in the annual calendar,” Cr Baberowski said.

“It’s a really fantastic opportunity to get together with friends or family to recollect (and record in some way would also be good) and share stories as you rummage for your favourite outdoor shots.

“The 2021 *Isn’t it fabulous…Celebrating fashion we love to remember* calendar was a real hit and I’m sure the 2022 calendar will also be just as light-hearted and valuable when it’s released in October.”

The winning photos will feature in the calendar along with photographer credits. Winning contributors will receive a canvas print of their winning entry, five copies of the 2022 calendar to share with family and friends and an invitation to the calendar launch celebration.

Entries close at 5pm, Monday, August 16 2021

Photographs must be owned by the entrant, who must also have authority to provide council with permission to publish the submitted photo, and be provided in either high resolution digital format, or an original suitable for scanning.

Online entry is preferred via the heritage website heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

If your photo needs to be scanned, council’s Customer Contact Centre will be pleased to assist.

Visit [heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Heritage-Calendar-2022)
&#x20;for details and conditions.

The Heritage Levy funded calendar is produced annually to celebrate and remember our region’s heritage.
