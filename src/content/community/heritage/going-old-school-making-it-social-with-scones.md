Who knew that flour, butter and milk could come together to create not just a tasty treat, but a way for communities to connect, talk and break free from isolation?

Sunshine Coast foodie Martin Duncan did.

Mr Duncan takes an old-school approach to bringing people together – scones, tea and a great venue.

Mr Duncan said he started the Scone Time events as a way to combat isolation experienced by our elderly residents and to breathe life into Sunshine Coast heritage halls.

“Now, Scone Time is about bringing everyone together for a good old-fashioned chat, in person, while enjoying a sweet treat,” Mr Duncan said.

“In early 2020 Sunshine Coast Council invited me to run the event at Bankfoot House and it was a great way to invite people to really connect.

“Bankfoot provides a very special venue to host Scone Time and fits perfectly with the notion of sharing a yarn.”

The first event for 2021 was held at heritage listed Bankfoot House on Thursday 11 March and welcomed 88 people from around the Sunshine Coast to the sold out event.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said sharing food at events such as Scone Time is such a lovely way to build relationships and a helpful boost to local businesses.

“This is an excellent way to promote both conversations and the region’s local food producers such as our Food Agricultural Network members, as well as the Coochin Creek and Beerwah Co-ops,” Cr Baberowski said.

“There are a growing number of events held at the Bankfoot House precinct and catering at this remarkable location supports local producers and suppliers.”

Cultural Heritage Coordinator Peter Connell said the parallels between Bankfoot House and Scone Time made this event the perfect fit for the heritage precinct.

“Bankfoot was a place to meet and share stories,” Mr Connell said.

“It was host to three generations of primary producers, the Grigor family, the Burgess family and the Ferris family, all of whom were involved in growing the fruit, among other crops, for making jams.

“Bankfoot was also a social hub for the family, many of whom were actively involved in establishing community halls.”

Mr Duncan will deliver the next [Fridays@Bankfoot](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Fridays)
&#x20;event on 9 April, Cooking up a storm: Jams and Preserves. It’s a hands-on workshop sharing heritage recipes and items from the Bankfoot House collection.
