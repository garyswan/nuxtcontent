On 17 October 1887 an enterprising group of ex-German nationals from a German settlement south of Brisbane decided to move out of the homes of their migrant parents and strike out on their own.

The young men selected land portions in the Blackall Range and formed the new town of Teutoburg, situated about four miles north-west of Maleny.

On 20 May 1916, the town’s name was changed to Witta and was recorded in the Queensland Government Gazette—the word Witta is believed to be a corruption of the Kabi Kabi word for dingo, “wetya”.

The reason for the town’s name change was not spelt out in the 1916 Government Gazette but during the years of the First World War people and places with Germanic sounding names came under close scrutiny by members of the public and by some government officials.

Drive around Witta today, and you’ll still notice many German-sounding names, hinting at the hinterland town’s heritage.

Hear the fascinating stories of those pioneering young men and the influence they had on Maleny as local author Dale Jacobsen presents ‘The formation of the Witta community’ at Bankfoot House.
