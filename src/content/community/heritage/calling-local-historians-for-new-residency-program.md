Local heritage experts are being called to help fill the knowledge gaps of the Sunshine Coast’s rich history by being part of the region’s first [Historian in Residence program](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Historian-in-Residence)
.

Council is calling for expressions of interest from historians to join the residency program and is offering two positions on a three-month contract.

Sunshine Coast Council heritage portfolio councillor Rick Baberowski said the program was a great opportunity to expand the knowledge of the region’s local history and increase the understanding of council’s collections.

“We are looking for qualified and experienced historians who will immerse themselves in a research project that will reveal, document and showcase aspects of our region’s history and heritage,” Cr Baberowski said

“The suggested topics are broad – from First Nations to European settlement stories. We are also open to other suggestions.

“This means we may receive interest from a diverse range of historians including archaeologists, heritage librarians, museologists, archivists, teachers and heritage architects.

“There will be opportunity to capture community input as those with information on either chosen project will be invited to share their knowledge.

“The idea to commission experts to research and tell the story of the Sunshine Coast is a direct outcome from the community consultation which informed council’s Heritage Plan 2021-2031.”

Sunshine Coast Council has significant cultural heritage collections, which are managed by Cultural Heritage Services and the Heritage Library.

Stories could evolve from existing council collections, an historic event, contemporary topic, or be based on an identified gap in an existing body of historical work. 

Expression of Interest submissions close 25 August 2021.

Guidelines for submission and further information can be found at [heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Historian-in-Residence)
&#x20;or by contacting culturalheritage\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au

This program is supported by the Sunshine Coast Council’s Cultural Heritage Levy.
