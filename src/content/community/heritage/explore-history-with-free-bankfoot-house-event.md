If you like things that were made to last and created the good old fashioned way, then you’ll love this.

On Friday 4 June, Cobb and Co Museum present Heritage trades – a free event at Bankfoot House.

Join the museum team as you’ll learn how to create stick furniture in a hands-on demonstration and hear how heritage trades were necessary to keep coaching alive in colonial times.

Limited spaces and registration essential.\
