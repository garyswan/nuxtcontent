Multi-platinum and critically acclaimed Sydney trio DMA’S are coming to the Sunshine Coast.

This modern Australian pop-rock band with a hint of Britpop influence has announced it will stop at Venue 114 this October.

DMA’S tour will feature their latest single *Something we are overcoming* from its hotly anticipated album *How Many Dreams?* as well as cult-favourites *Delete*, *Silver* and *Life Is a Game of Changing.*

The anthemic trio has gone from conquering the main stage at Reading and Leeds to amassing more over 400 million streams, and the DMA’S are ready to shake off any genre expectations with their latest releases.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said he welcomed the opportunity to showcase the diverse range of events at the popular community venue.

“Venue 114 has an incredible year ahead with an epic line-up sure to excite the Sunshine Coast live music enthusiasts,” Cr O’Pray said.

“DMA’S join The Jungle Giants, Spacey Jane and Lime Cordiale as part of an [impressive calendar of music and events](https://oursc.com.au/community/events/vibrant-calendar-of-events-not-to-be-missed)
