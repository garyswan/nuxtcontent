If you haven’t already, it’s not too late to have your say on Marcoola North Foreshore upgrade!

Sunshine Coast Council has been working with the Marcoola community to develop a draft [Marcoola Park and Streetscape Master Plan](https://hdp-au-prod-app-suncst-haveyoursay-files.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/8716/5475/3323/Marcoola_North_Placemaking_Project_Draft_Master_Plan_Concept_Rev_A.pdf)
.

The plan was developed from the valuable ideas and feedback provided in the previous round of engagement conducted between December 2021 and January 2022.

Enhancing green spaces and the well-loved playground, improving footpaths and amenities plus preserving the pristine foreshore are key ideas shared by the Marcoola community in the first round of community consultation.

After translating your feedback into the draft Master Plan, council is now asking the community ‘have we got it right?’

The draft design has been open for feedback since Thursday 9 June and closes TOMORROW!

Complete the [online survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mnfp)
 at haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mnfp before tomorrow - Friday, July 8, 2022.

**

Following this consultation, the Master Plan will be finalised, and projects identified for future budget consideration and delivery.

**Master Plan key ideas:**

*   Preserve the Marcoola ‘vibe’ characterised by its casual and relaxed feel, it’s value of community, and respect for the natural coastal environment.
*   Enhance Felix Parry Park and playground as a much-loved destination used by the community and visitors.  
*   Improve pedestrian access and safety across Marcoola Esplanade and Petrie Avenue.
*   Improve footpaths in the town area to increase safety and shared zones for pedestrian and cyclists.
*   Maintain parking where possible, particularly near the shops and the Marcoola Surf Life Saving Club, without impacting greenspace.  
*   Add more trees to the park and surrounding streets for shade.
*   Preserve the foreshore and existing vegetation. Ensure any improvements are reflective of the community’s strong environmental values.
