The forecast of rain and very strong winds during crucial install periods this weekend has forced Horizon Festival organisers to make the difficult decision to postpone *[Dawn Awakening](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/dawn-awakening/)
,* the closing event for the 2022 Horizon Festival, scheduled to be held at sunrise on Sunday (September 4).

Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold said the decision was made after consultation with artists, creatives and suppliers.

“Due to the very technical nature of the event and special lighting curated for the show, safety for both the artists and crew is our priority,” Ms Clissold said.

“While we understand people will be extremely disappointed, we are working on an alternative date with all stakeholders.”

All registered attendees will be notified of the postponement via email and will be further advised when a new date is scheduled.
