Revitalisation plans for a town renowned as “the heart of the hinterland’’ have taken a huge step forward.

Sunshine Coast Council has secured a design consultant to lead a project that will help revive the region’s historic hub of Nambour.

The [Nambour (Namba) Place Revitalisation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Nambour-Centre-Activation-Project/Nambour-Place-Revitalisation-Project)
&#x20;aims to develop a precinct-wide strategy for Nambour’s town centre to consolidate its growing reputation as a creative and welcoming place.  

This approach will ensure that designs for the town’s public realm will respond to the values and needs of the community, as well as align with, and inform, on-going strategic planning for the town.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was pleased to announce the appointment of a principal consultant to lead the draft concept design.

“This project is part of creating a vibrant hinterland heart that will meet the needs of our whole community. It will also ensure we are servicing the business, entertainment, cultural, health and education needs of the town and the surrounding communities,” Cr Law said.

“Council will continue to lead the design and community engagement for this revitalisation and is now meeting with a wide range of stakeholders, including the First Nations community.

“One of the discussions we’ve had is around connection to country through the place name.  Namba is derived from the First Nations word, referring to the flowering tea-tree.

“We are also working with the Department of Transport and Main Roads regarding the future of the centre’s traffic network and getting the balance right between promoting walkability and pedestrian safety along the main street while still maintaining traffic flow.”

By improving pedestrian experience and introducing features that encourage footfall and interaction we are aiming to create a more active main street where people feel comfortable walking through town just as they would through a major shopping centre.

Sunshine Coast Council has appointed Brisbane based and leading Australian design firm [T.C.L](https://tcl.net.au/)
&#x20;as the principal consultant to lead the draft precinct-wide concept designs and 10-year implementation plan.

The company has worked on similar large-scale masterplan revitalisations in Yeppoon, Melbourne and Brisbane.

“The basis for the concept design will provide a clear and detailed understanding of how the town centre will look and function, how much it will cost, and provide a roadmap for when each stage of construction can occur,” Cr Law said.

“Council has also engaged local specialists, including Nambour-based design firm [POMO](https://pomo.com.au/Home)
, to assist with the process and bring a place-specific understanding to the project.

“The project will draw inspiration and direction from previous community engagement and planning with community groups and council, which outlined a vision for Nambour’s future.”

Council recognises the importance of Nambour as one of the region’s key service centres and the work being undertaken will help create a sense of place for the future of Nambour and hinterland communities.

Council undertook a robust procurement process to secure the consultants for this placemaking strategy which is part of Nambour Centre Activation Project – focussed on invigorating this major hinterland centre over the next 10 years.

T.C.L Studio Principal Deb Robbins said the team was delighted to be part of the Nambour (Namba) Place Revitalisation Project.

“This project represents an intertwining of community, history, environment, and public space,” Ms Robbins said.

“These are issues we love to delve into, consult with and gain feedback from community and stakeholders and resolve via inspiring, place specific responses. 

“The project will be delivered in collaboration with council and the community to revitalise the precinct to once again become a bustling hub of activity that attracts local business and community back into its heart.”

The consultant project team will be led by T.C.L with Wilson Architects, Aurecon, UAP and Turner Townsend.

POMO Design Director Stephen Burton said the team looked forward to working on a local project that hits close to home.

“Nambour is a unique community which is unlike any on the Sunshine Coast with a special history and enormous potential,” Mr Burton said.

“By starting with a deep understanding of this, the design process will get off on the right track and stay true to the values of the community and the place.”

Once the concept design has been completed next year, further feedback and collaboration with the community will occur.

Member for Nicklin, Rob Skelton MP said he was excited to see the results of the ongoing community consultation begin to come to life.

“With the region currently experiencing substantial investment through the $86 million Nambour General Hospital redevelopment, the new $9 million Police Station, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of housing developments, and with increasing interest in the Special Entertainment Precinct, now is the time to ensure we get it right in the CBD,” Mr Skelton said.

“With a potential venue for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic games right on our doorstop in the Parklands Mountain Bike trails, these works will help show off our town and make it easier to get around for the thousands of international visitors expected to visit over the next decade.

“I look forward to working with the community, Council, and TMR to ensure the best outcome for our local residents, businesses and tourists, and I encourage everyone get involved and have their say.

“These are exciting times for Nambour!”
