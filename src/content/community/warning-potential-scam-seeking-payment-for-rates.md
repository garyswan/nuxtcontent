Sunshine Coast Council is warning residents to be aware of bogus emails requesting payment of rates.

Council has become aware of a small number of incidents where a scammer has emailed residents asking for payment of rates using a BSB and bank account number.

Please note that council never asks for rates to be paid to a BSB and account number.

Ratepayers are advised to please pay their rates using the methods printed on your rate notice. Please contact council directly if you have any questions.

If anyone receives an email of this nature and recognises it as a scam, the matter can be reported online to [www.scamwatch.gov.au](http://www.scamwatch.gov.au)


Anyone who has received an email of this nature and paid money to the emailer is encouraged to contact Policelink on 131 444 so that the matter can be investigated.
