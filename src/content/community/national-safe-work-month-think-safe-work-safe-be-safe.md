Our community is urged to behave safely, respectfully and patiently this National Safe Work Month.

Sunshine Coast Council is committed to creating safe and healthy workplaces for all employees.

Being healthy and safe means being free from both physical and psychological harm.

October is [National Safe Work Month](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/national-safe-work-month)
&#x20;and this year’s theme is **think safe. work safe. be safe.** No job should be unsafe and no death or injury is acceptable.

Council’s outdoor workforce and road work contractors are often faced with unacceptable verbal abuse and their safety is put at risk by unsafe public driving behaviour through and around council’s work sites and road works.

This National Safe Work Month we’re reminding users of our region’s roads and infrastructure to behave safely, respectfully, and patiently towards council workers while they perform their duties to keep our communities safe. They have families, too.

Please keep our road workers and other motorists safe - here are some of the things you can do:

*   **Slow down**– observe the stated speed limits within and around road works and construction sites for the safety of motorists, pedestrians, road workers and traffic controllers.
*   **Be patient** – recognise that road works and council construction sites can cause frustration yet they are necessary for maintenance and upgrades to public infrastructure.
*   **Allow for delays** – factor in extra travel time to allow for potential delays during your journey.
*   **Don’t abuse council workers** – please behave safely, respectfully, and patiently towards council workers as they perform their duties for the benefit of the community.
