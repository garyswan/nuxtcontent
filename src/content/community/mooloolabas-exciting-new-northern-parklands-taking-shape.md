With the new boardwalk and viewing platform linking Alexandra Headland to the Mooloolaba Esplanade already open, the finishing touches are now underway to complete Stage One of the [Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Mooloolaba-Foreshore-Revitalisation-Project)
&#x20;project.

The Northern Parkland is the first new community space to be delivered as part of the multiple-stage placemaking project, which is set to be unveiled in early July with an official opening and community event to be announced shortly.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said he was excited to see the Northern Parkland nearing completion.

“I’m thrilled our community will soon be able to enjoy full access to the Northern Parkland including the open green space, public toilets, barbecue shelter, picnic tables and adventure playground just in time for the July school holidays,” Cr Natoli said.

“Council is creating these wonderful new community spaces for all to enjoy and access.

“The Mooloolaba foreshore is much loved by residents and visitors and the new Northern Parkland will be another feather in its cap.”

Works are now underway to complete the new public amenities, barbeque area, children’s playgrounds, shade sails, ocean view deck and gardens.

In addition to the new infrastructure, more than 120 new trees and 10,000 new shrubs and groundcovers have been planted in the Northern Parkland to further enhance the space and provide extra shade.

“I want to thank everyone who provided feedback during the recent community engagement for the next stage of this important project, the Central Meeting Place,” Cr Natoli said.

“The survey results are now being collated and assessed and council will provide an update in due course.

“This feedback will help council determine how future works progress at the Mooloolaba foreshore, and there will be another chance for the community to provide input later this year.”

The Queensland Government has invested $4.6 million into Stage 1 through the $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package for south east Queensland councils to stimulate economies and support jobs.

Sunshine Coast Council has committed $11.5 million towards Stage 1 and is proud to have local firms deliver this new parkland precinct.
