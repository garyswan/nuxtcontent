After numerous successful events on the Gold Coast, Townsville, Newcastle and Sydney, the Aria Beach 5s Rugby Festival is returning to Mooloolaba Beach for an exciting, entertaining and fun-filled event.

Beach Rugby 5s is an exciting and fast-paced mixture of rugby union and rugby league. Since starting in Australia in 2018, thousands of spectators have had the chance to jump into the free, entertaining action and watch their favourite players play once again.  

This Saturday, dual international Lote Tuqiri, alongside the likes of Former QLD Reds and Wallabies player, George Smith will play in the Australian Dingoes All Stars team against the Pasifika All Stars Team at 1pm. 

Beach Rugby Australia Director Peter Hickey says he is excited to see the return of the tournament to this weekend. 

"We are so excited to have Beach 5s return to Mooloolaba this weekend," Mr Hickey said.

"Our last tournament at Mooloolaba was extremely successful, with plenty of entertainment, great games of footy and plenty of action by the beach.

“We are very excited to also bring on the Mark Hughes Foundation as our charity partner for the event. 

“We will be selling towelling beach bucket hats down by the beach for spectators and players, with funds raised going straight to the Mark Hughes Foundation ,” he said.

Beach Rugby Australia Ambassador and former dual international, Lote Tuqiri says he is looking forward to enjoying the event with keen spectators.

“This is our third season back at Mooloolaba and it is shaping up to be another great event,” Tuqiri said. 

“The Sunshine Coast has always been a fantastic event for everyone who attends and plays, so we are all very excited to get back on the sand this weekend,” he said. 

The tournament is free for spectators to attend and will be held at Mooloolaba Beach from Saturday 5th to Sunday the 6th of November.  

Lote Tuqiri and Beach Rugby Australia Director Peter Hickey will be available for media upon request.
