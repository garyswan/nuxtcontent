Since undergoing a $380,000 upgrade in July last year, Albany Lakes Park in Sippy Downs is the place to be to let the kids run wild and free.

After the playground was moved to a new location, it’s become an adventure mecca, from swings, slides and climbing nets to nature-based play and quiet green nooks for little legs to explore.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said he was pleased to announce Stage 2 works would start next week (23 May) to install shade sails, weather permitting.  

“Council has partnered with the Queensland Government to deliver each stage of the Albany Lakes Park Landscape Concept Plan to provide a great new facility for the Sippy Downs community,” Cr Dickson said.

“Recreation parks are an integral part of our region and it’s important we keep them cool and shady all year round.

“Shade is always a key consideration by council when upgrading play infrastructure. However sometimes natural shade isn’t always an option, which is why, when funding becomes available, council ensures provisions are made for installing sails.

“The shade structures for Albany Lakes Park will provide adequate shade across the various play elements to ensure a welcoming and cool environment for prep to late primary school-aged children.

“The sails have been designed around the future works to the park which includes an eight-meter multilevel play tower with two large slides, plus a sheltered barbecue area.

“It’s really great to see our community getting outside and connecting with nature – playgrounds like this one, go a long way to improving our overall wellbeing.”

, with new pathways and spaces for the community to sit, relax or enjoy a picnic.

The shade sails will take five days to install, and the playground will need to be closed for those days. To ensure play can continue, the works will be split across four weeks allowing the park to remain open in between installation days.  

The Queensland Government has committed $600,000 under the South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program for Stage 2 upgrades.

State Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to support this project as part of the program, building on $150,000 allocated to Stage 1 works through the Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package.

“The Queensland Government is proud to support our councils through important funding programs such as the South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program and the Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package,” Mr Hunt said.

“Through these programs, Sunshine Coast Regional Council has been allocated more than $15.53 million towards community infrastructure projects, aimed at improving liveability for the community.”

The remainder of Stage 2 works will start in July and are expected to be complete in September, weather conditions permitting. The playground will need to be closed while installation takes place for the safety of our park users.
