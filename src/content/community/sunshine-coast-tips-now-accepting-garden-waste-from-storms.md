Thanks for your patience while we cleared space at our tips for your garden waste from the recent storms and floods.

The tip fees are waived for flood and storm damaged items, food and garden waste until COB this Sunday 13 March.

All tips are accepting garden waste. Locations are available on [council's website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Rubbish-Tip-Locations-and-Fees)
.

Weâ€™ve put on extra staff over the next week and we ask you to please be kind to them as they work as quickly as they can to safely process your waste.

Buderim second-hand market will be closed this weekend and staff redirected to help you move through the queue as fast as possible.
