South east Queensland’s favourite beachside festival, Caloundra Music Festival, is set to make major waves 1-3 October, featuring Ball Park Music, Sneaky Sound System, Spiderbait and The Stones’ Sticky Fingers starring Adalita, Phil Jamieson and Tim Rogers.

Also ready to rock the stage are Baker Boy, Ben Lee, Gyroscope, Katchafire, San Cisco, The Badloves, The Superjesus and The Whitlams.

Spiderbait have racked up pretty much every accolade there is to achieve on the Australian scene, having taken home numerous ARIA Awards for their distinctive music and cheeky arrangements making them difficult to pigeonhole anywhere but main stage on Friday night.

Indie pop-band San Cisco are an exciting late addition to the Friday line-up, returning to CMF to share their new album before heading off on the next stage of their national tour.

The Saturday line-up features artists from the 2021 Queensland Music Awards (QMA) including finalists Thelma Plum and WAAX, plus winner of the Folk / Singer Songwriter Award, Jaguar Jonze and Album of the Year winners Ball Park Music.

Ball Park Music first played at the festival in 2012 and are returning to headline the Saturday night performance. Last year saw the release of their sixth LP and first self-titled album. It debuted at #2 on the ARIA Charts – their fifth to crack the ARIA Top 10 – and saw the band hold six spots in ARIA’s Vinyl Albums Top 10 Chart. The band celebrated release week with 13 sold-out shows at Brisbane’s Triffid, triple j’s feature album of the week, performed on triple j’s Like A Version and received a nomination for triple j’s Australian album of the year.

On Sunday 3 October the festival will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Rolling Stones’ album Sticky Fingers with Adalita (Magic Dirt), Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon) and Tim Rogers (You Am I) bringing the songs to life.

With four festival stages providing back-to-back entertainment over three days, Sunshine Coast performers will also get their share of the platform this year with more than 30 local bands on the bill. Band of Frequencies, Sametime and Sugarbag Blond to name a few will perform Friday. Bearfoot, Mason Hope and Maya & the Band will shine on Saturday. Andrea Kirwin with the Yama-Nui Social Club, JaZZella, and MUFASSA & the Pride will bring the energy for Sunday punters.

Tickets are on sale for the Caloundra Music Festival. With limited capacity due to COVID-19, it’s important to snap up tickets quickly. [www.caloundramusicfestival.com](http://www.caloundramusicfestival.com)
