Residents are being urged to take part in consultation that’s now underway regarding land nominated for a community facility at 214 The Avenue, Peregian Springs.

A series of pop-up stalls, an online survey, plus a virtual and in-person workshop will be held this month (November) to gauge local views and needs for a facility in Peregian Springs.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez encouraged people to have their say by Tuesday, November 30.

“This has been on the local community wish list for quite a while so now’s the time to let council know how useful it could be,” Cr Suarez said.

“Would this facility support cultural or artistic needs? Would it be a place for health and community connection? Perhaps a place for innovation and educational opportunities? Or maybe a place for recreational or social opportunities perhaps. What are your thoughts on the impact to vegetation should a facility progress?

“During this engagement process, we’ll also explore whether there are any potential partnerships and opportunities for the future delivery of the facility and funding sources.

“Don’t delay, have your say today.”
