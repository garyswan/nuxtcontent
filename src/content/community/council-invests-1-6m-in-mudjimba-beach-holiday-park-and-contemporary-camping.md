Since the 1970s, the hidden oasis of Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park has been welcoming generations of travellers craving a caravanning and camping escape.

Soon the tranquil park, situated directly across the road from the stunning Mudjimba Beach, will offer upgraded visitor comfort.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said works had started on a modern, sustainable and accessible amenities block.

“This home-away-from-home is one of our region’s most peaceful holiday havens which is why council has invested $1.6 million in the amenities facility to ensure they remain contemporary and attractive for all our valued guests,” Cr O’Pray said.

“Early works kicked-off in March to prepare the foundations for the new building’s amenities and showers for all campers, including those living with a disability, and a laundry space to wash and dry.

“Local construction firm Murphy Builders have been engaged to construct the new building which will also be equipped with solar power generation, battery storage and rainwater harvesting for use in flushing toilets.

“The existing amenities building will stay open to campers while the new facility is being built on the south-side of the existing block.

“Once the coastal-style building is ready for guests, the existing amenities building will be demolished and removed from site to make way for open green space.”

While campers enjoy soaking up the sun and salt air, council has selected materials, fittings and fixtures to withstand the coastal environment, achieve longevity and reduce maintenance costs.

Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park Manager Nicole Filippini said the new upgrade would be well received.

“This upgrade will meet the demand for the ever-growing number of guests exploring this wonderful part of the Sunshine Coast,” Mrs Filippini said

“Each site is private and peaceful away from the bustling crowds and is one of two council-owned, dog-friendly family [holiday parks](https://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;on the Sunshine Coast – the other at Coolum which is also undergoing a very similar amenities upgrade.

“The Mudjimba Beach Holiday Park now offers guests 109 fully serviced slab sites, 64 fully serviced grass sites and 10 unpowered grass sites which was also thanks to an upgrade in 2021.

“These upgrades go a long way to improving the park, which I’m sure campers will be very excited to see and use from around August.”

Council operates six holiday parks in the Sunshine Coast area – Dicky Beach, Mooloolaba, Maroochydore, Cotton Tree, Coolum and Mudjimba. Visit the [Sunshine Coast Holiday Parks](https://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;website for information regarding each of these parks.
