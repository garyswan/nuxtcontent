Re-homing impounded dogs, an extraordinary building work permit for outside of standard hours and changes to penalties for minor infringements are all being considered as part of a suite of proposed local law changes.

An overview of [the proposed local law amendments](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/proposed-amendments-local-laws)
&#x20;can be found on Sunshine Coast Council’s Have Your Say website.

Community members wishing to comment on the proposed amendments have until 5pm on Friday March 3 to submit their feedback to council.

### Proposed amendments include:

*   creating tiered categories of penalties that would allow flexibility of a lower cost infringement notice proportionate to the offence
*   creating an extraordinary building work permit for outside standard hours
*   creating a ‘disposal order’ (as an alternative to a destruction order) to include the ability to re-home suitable impounded dogs
*   updating maps for exclusion of dogs from specific public places, including in areas to be designated within Muller Park at Bli Bli and the Maleny Show Grounds
*   adding dog off leash areas for Flintwood Crescent Palmview, Mapleton Lilyponds, Quota Memorial Park Nambour, Baringa Forest Park, Annalise Circuit Park Nirimba, Viridian Circuit Park Birtinya and Grand Parade Parrearra
*   amending the minimum standards required for a dog enclosure
*   increasing the unauthorised disability parking penalty to align with State Government amendments.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said local laws helped to ensure safety, harmony and good rule within the diverse communities of the Sunshine Coast.

“Every five years council undertakes a review to determine changes needed to our local laws to ensure they continue to be responsive to the needs of our communities,” Cr Hungerford said.

“From now until March 3, there is an opportunity for everyone to review the current proposed changes to local laws and subordinate local laws and let council know what you think.

“Council will consider all submissions and feedback received and any formal changes to local laws and subordinate local laws will be made at a future meeting of council.” 

Community members wishing to comment on the proposed amendments to local laws have until **5pm on Friday March 3**, **2023,** to submit their feedback to council. Submissions can be lodged via:
