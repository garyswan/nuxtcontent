More than 200 people gathered at Mooloolaba Beach on Friday December 3 to celebrate International Day of People with Disability.

Sunshine Coast Council partnered with Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club and many community organisations to host the free event for everyone to enjoy.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the All Access – Day at the Beach! event was a hit with all ages and people of all abilities.

“All Access promoted the importance of accessibility on local beaches and across the Sunshine Coast as well as the diverse range of accessible activities available for people of different abilities,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Council places a high priority on shining a light on the importance of inclusion in our community, while also celebrating the many abilities and achievements of people with a disability.

“Our expanded Accessible Beaches Program is rolled out at four locations across the region including Coolum, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba and Kings beaches.

“Operating this program is not possible without council’s collaboration with the Volunteer Surf Lifesaving Patrols at the Surf Life Saving Clubs.

“The Compass Institute Inc. joined the accessible beaches program in 2020, making a beach wheelchair available during business hours, year-round.”

There are more than 4.4 million people currently living with a disability in Australia and the 2016 ABS census reports 5.7 per cent (16,853 people) of the Sunshine Coast population have a need for assistance with core activities.

Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club President Darryl Johnson said he was proud to see so many people show their support. 

"Mooloolaba Beach is the most inclusive beach on the Sunshine Coast and we’re extremely proud to support this event in promoting inclusion, diversity and beach access for all,” Mr Johnson said.

Activities included volleyball, all-abilities rugby program, tai chi, seated Zumba, beach access mats, Cycling Without Age trishaw rides along the Coastal pathway, beach wheelchairs, a mobile hoist, sand and water play and a fundraising barbecue hosted by Mooloolaba SLSC.

This event was proudly supported by Steps, Bush Kids, Montrose, Equity Works, Mooloolaba Starfish Nippers, Collaborative Partnership, NDIS, QLD NRL (All abilities program), Sunshine Coast Council Libraries and Healthy Sunshine Coast.
