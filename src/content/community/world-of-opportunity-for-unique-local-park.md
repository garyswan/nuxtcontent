A ‘natural and unique’ part of the Sunshine Coast has gained international recognition that could further boost its appeal, along with business and tourism.

After an extensive judging process, the Kings Beach Park and Community Precinct has been awarded the Green Flag Award.

It is only the fourth Queensland park to receive this prestigious accolade, joining the likes of South Bank and Roma Street Parklands in Brisbane and the Chinchilla Botanic Parkland located in the heart of the Western Downs.

The [Green Flag Award](https://www.greenflagaward.org/)
® scheme recognises and rewards well-managed parks and green spaces, setting the benchmark standard for the management of recreational outdoor spaces around the world.

Winning an award brings with it a wealth of benefits, from the status of being affiliated with a prestigious awards program through to tangible benefits such as boosting tourism and opening up revenue opportunities.

Cr Terry Landsberg and Parks and Gardens team

Sunshine Coast Council Divisional Councillor Terry Landsberg said the international accreditation recognised Kings Beach Park and Community Precinct as a premier beachside destination for community recreation, tourism, and events.

“Receiving this esteemed award highlights the amazing work undertaken by our dedicated team across Council,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Successfully being awarded a Green Flag Award acknowledges the overall vision for Kings Beach Park and Community Precinct to capture the mountains to the sea character of the city.

“The vision also complements and reflects the natural and unique environments of Caloundra and provides a safe, family-oriented recreation and leisure precinct with opportunities for economic and social benefits.

Manager Parks and Gardens Nicholas Coluccio said maintaining open spaces our community loved to enjoy was one of Council's main priorities.

“Many of our staff work tirelessly in maintaining this particular park and I’m really proud that their work has been recognised,” Mr Coluccio said.

Council also has recently been recognised at a state and national level for the Sunshine Coast Recreation Parks Plan 2021-2031.

This latest Green Flag Award confirms one of the many ways it continues to deliver on its [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;(ELS), which provides long-term direction to guide growth and shape a sustainable future for our region.
