A bird’s-eye-view over Hunchy Road, Hunchy gives drivers a different perspective of the new rehabilitation works undertaken as part of the Australian Government’s Black Spot Program.  

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said he was committed to improving the safety of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians across rural roads.

“The project team captured drone footage of the completed works at Hunchy which I think gives the community a clear picture of the extensive safety works carried out,” Cr Johnston said.

“The works undertaken include widening two tight curves to improve safety between Blackbutt and Hardings roads, rehabilitation works including strengthening the existing pavement and resurfacing Hunchy Road.

“The works have greatly improved visibility when approaching the curves and has made it safer for motorists entering and exiting properties.

“Council secured $1.7 million from the Australian Government’s Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications Black Spot Program to complete the works.  

“Black Spot projects target locations where crashes occur and provide funding to implement measures to reduce the risks of further crashes – so I am extremely pleased to be able to deliver these vital safety works for the Division 5 community.”

The works started in February and took approximately six months to complete.
