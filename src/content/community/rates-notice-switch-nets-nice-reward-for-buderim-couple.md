Switching their rates notice delivery method from traditional post to email has paid off for a Buderim couple, who are the latest winners of Sunshine Coast Council’s ‘Win Your Rates’ competition. 

Gregory and Deborah will have $$836.26 taken off their next rates bill after winning the competition, which ran from July 19 to August 19. 

“We’d like to say a big thank you to Sunshine Coast Council,” Deborah said.

“We changed over to receiving our rates notices by email earlier this month.

“While the chance to win this competition was a big incentive, we also believe in doing our bit to help the environment and reducing paper is one way we can achieve that

“Making the change to our rates notice delivery method on MyCouncil was nice and straightforward and we’re looking forward to the convenience of receiving and paying our future rates online.”

Sunshine Coast Council Finance Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said receiving rates notices by email rather than traditional post was more environmentally friendly and registering for a MyCouncil account enabled residents to access a range of convenient online options.

“Around 45,000 property owners in our region have made the change to receiving their rate notices electronically,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Moving to an online system enables ratepayers to receive their rate notices wherever they are, anywhere in the world and arrange payment in a convenient and timely manner.

“You can also view your property information, manage your pet registrations and make requests to council through MyCouncil. 

“I encourage all ratepayers who’re still receiving their notices in the post to visit council’s website, sign up to [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or login to their existing MyCouncil account and change your preferred rates notice delivery method from post to email.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or  logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change to email.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account and changing your preferred rates notice delivery method on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
.

There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;to show you how to change your rates delivery method from traditional post to email.

People who are experiencing difficulty paying their rates are encouraged to enter into a payment arrangement by logging into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or by contacting council on (07) 5475 7272.
