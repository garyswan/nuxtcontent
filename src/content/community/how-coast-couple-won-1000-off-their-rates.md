Making one simple switch has earned a Mountain Creek couple $1000 off their next rates bill.

The couple are the latest winners of Sunshine Coast Council’s ‘Win Your Rates’ competition, which ran from January 24 to February 23.

“Like a lot of people on the Sunshine Coast, we both care greatly about our environment,’’ the couple said.

“Making the change to reduce paper and receive our rates notices by email instead of in the post made all the sense in the world to us and having the chance to win $1000 off our next rates bill was a big incentive as well.

“With the money we’ll save, we’re planning to buy some new books for our children and enjoy a trip away during the Easter holidays.” 

Sunshine Coast Council Finance Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said receiving rates notices by email rather than traditional post was more environmentally friendly.

Cr Hungerford said registering for a MyCouncil account also enabled residents to access a range of convenient online options.

“The couple are among approximately 50,000 property owners who’ve made the change to receiving their rate notices electronically.

“Sending rates notices electronically is one of many ways council can operate in a more environmentally friendly way and continue to create a healthy, smart and creative lifestyle here on the Sunshine Coast.

“Moving to an online system also enables ratepayers to receive their rate notices wherever they are, anywhere in the world and arrange payment in a convenient and timely manner.

“I encourage all ratepayers who are still receiving their notices in the post to visit council’s website, sign up to [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or login to their existing MyCouncil account and change your preferred rates notice delivery method from post to email.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or  logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change to email.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
.

Step by step guide how to change your rates notice to be delivered by email.

There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;(see above) to show you how to change your rates delivery method from traditional post to email.

There is a range of convenient online payment options available, including BPAY and by phone on 131 816. Check your rate notice to see all the ways you can pay.

Council also has a direct debit option, which can be set up to pay rates in full by the due date, to make life easier for busy ratepayers.

To assist with online or over-the-phone payments, property owners will need their payment reference number, found on their rates notice.

Ratepayers who cannot make payment by the due date are encouraged to enter into a payment arrangement by logging into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or by contacting council.

You can also [set up a payment arrangement on line, via councils website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Rates/Pay-by-instalments?utm_source=corporate&utm_medium=spotlights&utm_campaign=Rates)
. For rates enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
