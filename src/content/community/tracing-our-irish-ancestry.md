With 17 March being St Patrick’s Day, you might be asking yourself the question: How many people on the Sunshine Coast claim to have Irish ancestry?

Thanks to Sunshine Coast Council’s suite of web-based demographic tools, the question is a fairly easy one to answer.

Here are some facts:

In 2016, 13% of Sunshine Coast's population nominated Irish as one of their ancestries.

This is a higher percentage than Brisbane (12.3%), South-East Queensland (12.2%), Queensland (12%) and Australia (10.2%).

The five areas with the highest percentages (proportionally) were:

*   Maleny - Witta - North Maleny (16.3%)
*   Coolum Beach - Mount Coolum - Yaroomba - Point Arkwright (15.9%)
*   Caloundra - Kings Beach - Moffat Beach - Shelly Beach (15.4%)
*   Caloundra Central Activity Centre (15.2%)
*   Mapleton - Flaxton - Obi Obi (14.8%)

Happy St Patrick’s Day!
