Calling all Sunshine Coast university students and TAFE students! Kickstart your career and earn a wage with Sunshine Coast Council’s My Summer Workplace program.

[My Summer Workplace](https://careers.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/content/Internships/?locale=en_GB)
&#x20;is a 10-week program that runs from November to February, providing tertiary students with the opportunity to gain experience in their chosen profession in one of Australia’s most dynamic local government organisations. Applications for internships in the 2021-22 program are now open.

Applying for a My Summer Workplace internship in 2015 was a career game changer for Alex Dunn, who is now a Principle Property Officer with Sunshine Coast Council.

“I saw an advert for My Summer Workplace pop up on Facebook and thought that this would be a great thing for my resume and a good chance to get my foot in the door while I was still at uni,” he said.

“I’m so happy I applied for the program because it has provided me with a wonderful opportunity to kick-start my career.

“My role as Principle Property Officer is very diverse. I do everything from property acquisitions and disposals to property developments, sub-divisions and design and lease of cafes so it’s extremely interesting.

“At such a young age, doing the things I’m doing now, I feel very lucky to be in the position that I’m in. I don’t think I would have got that opportunity elsewhere.” 

Council invites applications from current or recently graduated tertiary students looking for an opportunity to expand their knowledge, skills and passion for innovation. Placements are offered in the areas of Business Performance, Economic and Community Development, Sport and Community Venues, Liveability and Natural Assets, Project Delivery and Communication and Marketing.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said demand for the My Summer Workplace program continued to grow, after starting in 2014 with just a handful of placements.

“Tertiary students in our region, like Alex Dunn and so many others, have recognised the benefits of this early chance to apply their theoretical skills to real-world situations,” Cr Hungerford said.

“As one of Queensland’s fastest growing regions with range of key projects underway and in the pipeline, there has never been a more exciting time to work at Sunshine Coast Council.”

To be eligible for [My Summer Workplace](https://careers.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/content/Internships/?locale=en_GB)
, applicants must be enrolled in a tertiary course and have completed 16 or more subjects, or have graduated within the last 12 months. Applicants must also reside in Queensland.

The program runs from November 29, 2021 to February 18, 2022, with a two-week break from December 27 to January 7, 2022. Students will be paid a nominal stipend.

Be sure to apply for the [2021/22 My Summer Workplace](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/en/Council/Employment/Employment-Programs-Traineeships-Cadetships-and-Graduates/My-Summer-Workplace)
&#x20;program by **Sunday, September 26**.
