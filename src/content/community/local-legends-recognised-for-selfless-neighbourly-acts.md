From creating a library book swap in their front garden, to mowing their neighbours’ lawns and organising games of cricket and annual Christmas parties in their local street, the winners of Sunshine Coast Council’s recent Neighbour Day 2022 competition have been crowned.

To celebrate Neighbour Day 2022, council asked the community to shout out a neighbour who they thought deserved a chance to win one of the three $100 Bunnings Vouchers.

The winners are:

*   Dave from Dicky Beach won

    [People’s Choice](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/neighbour-day-22/story/228/44)


    for his Father Christmas antics and caring check ins.

*   Ron received

    [Councillor’s Choice](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/neighbour-day-22/story/228/28)


    for his helpful pruning and neighbourhood parties.

*   Jane from Buderim earnt

    [Panel’s Choice](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/neighbour-day-22/story/228/37)


    for her community library and spirit.

Panel’s Choice winner Jane Kruger said she was chuffed to hear from her neighbour that she had won.

“During COVID-19 lockdown, I used to make cakes and take them to the neighbours across from me or to the other neighbour down the street,” Ms Kruger said.

“I also have a little street library outside my house, and I swap cakes for books.

“A few years ago, I received a lung transplant and I got a second chance at life, so I just enjoy life and try to help anyone else who is sick or having a hard time, because I had so many people look after me.

“I just believe in caring and sharing, because one never knows what the people on either side of you are going through. There are a lot of lonely people and if one small act can make someone smile, that’s a bonus.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the wealth of competition entries was evident of the Sunshine Coast’s community spirit.

“I would like to extend my congratulations to all winners and nominees and thank them for the work they do every day to make the Sunshine Coast welcoming, inclusive and connected,” Cr Law said.

“The wealth of competition entries received demonstrates the Sunshine Coast’s strong connected social fabric.

“Neighbourhoods are the heart of our region and by connecting with our neighbours we will continue to work towards our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;goal of building a strong community.”
