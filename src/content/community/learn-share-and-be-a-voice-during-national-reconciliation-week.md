National Reconciliation Week 2023 has been launched at TribalLink in Mapleton with a fire ceremony, traditional dance and presentations from Sunshine Coast Elders.

Hundreds gathered on Jinibara Country to celebrate and learn more about First Nations’ history and culture.

And there is more to come with a fascinating array of events and activities between May 27 and June 3.

#### This year’s National Reconciliation Week theme is *Be a Voice for Generations**.***

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said this encouraged all Australians to be a voice for reconciliation in tangible ways in our everyday lives – where we live, work and socialise.

“There are plenty of activities to support this week, and I strongly encourage you to attend the events on offer,” Cr Law said.

“Grab tickets to watch the Sunshine Coast Lightning take on the Collingwood Magpies for the First Nations round, or catch the film *Limbo* at Strand Cinema in Caloundra for a crime mystery thriller where detectives investigate a 20-year-old unsolved homicide of an Aboriginal woman.

“You can also join First Nations local hosts at Aunty Betty Memorial Reconciliation Walk at Dicky Beach or get a rare insight into the Gubbi Gubbi tradition of bark canoe building at Landsborough Museum.

“Take this opportunity to learn about First Nations culture and heritage and help to build stronger relationships with First Nations peoples – together, we are all stronger.”

Sunshine Coast Council Libraries will host a range of activities and provide resources across the week.

Locals can receive a special limited edition First Nations library card this National Reconciliation Week. The two available designs feature beautiful artworks by Kabi Kabi artists.

These offer a glimpse of the ancient knowledge and stories of our First Nations peoples. Visit [Council’s Libraries website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
