Through wars, droughts and floods, this grand tradition has continued for a century. From the excitement of the woodchop to prized cattle and champion sponge cakes or marmalades that used secret family recipes, it was an event that survived and thrived.

Now, one of Queensland’s proudest regional traditions – The Maleny Show – and those who made it great, will feature in a special documentary film.

The 100-year-old showcase of agriculture and community spirit, and many of those who have seen or helped it flourish, will be seen on the big screen.

A [free community screening](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/programs-and-events/100-years-of-maleny-show-film-premiere)
&#x20;will be held at Landsborough Museum on July 12 and everyone is invited.

The film will share the stories and memories of many people closely involved with the Maleny Show over the years.

These include Kayrene Corkin, Bill Hankinson, Marlene Hankinson, Winston Johnston, Ed Lawley, Desley Malone, Monica Skerman and Lois White.

Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston, also the Maleny Show Society President, said the film marked a significant milestone in the hinterland town.

“The Maleny Show was first held on April 24, 1923, at the Maleny showgrounds and has been held there ever since," Cr Johnston said.

"The show’s success has been the result of the Maleny Show Society, an organisation which has made a significant contribution to the region over the past 10 decades, and their hardworking volunteers who prepare for many months to put on the event.

"The film preserves an essential part of our Sunshine Coast heritage through the stories of these volunteers and captures the smells, sounds and sights of show time.

"It is only because of these volunteers’ efforts over the past 100 years, that we are now able to interpret this incredible story.”

Final filming wrapped-up over the Maleny Show weekend, allowing for the inclusion of the Showground 100 years on, drawing intriguing parallels between the show’s humble beginnings and today's modern pavilions and pursuits.

The film is an initiative of the Sunshine Coast Council Arts and Heritage Levy program.
