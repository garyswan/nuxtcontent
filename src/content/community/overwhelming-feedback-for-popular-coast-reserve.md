Thank you to our community for providing feedback to help shape the future of Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park.

The Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park Master Plan project team received a wide range of valuable feedback on the first round of community consultation.

The master plan aims to guide the future use and management of this coastal area, balancing the needs of users and the environment, for all our community to enjoy.

This important first step gives us an understanding about how this much-loved area is being used.

Our project team spoke with residents, businesses, visitors and community groups and listened to their ideas and concerns for this very popular reserve and park on the Sunshine Coast.

The project team conducted three community events at La Balsa Park and a community workshop and online survey between 29 November 2021 to 9 January 2022.

A Community Reference Group has been formed and is undertaking discussion.Â  Initially to further understand all the perspectives represented in the community and to then work toward finding the balance needed for the Master Plan.

Community and the Reference Group feedback will help council ensure a safe, shared space and preserve our natural environment. It will also inform the projects next stages.

The community will have another chance to provide feedback. The next phase of engagement will take place in early 2022 to test and confirm that community aspirations have been captured and incorporated into the draft Master Plan.

This stage of engagement is anticipated to include more on-line surveys, pop-up stalls, meetings and round table events. Council will keep the community updated as the project progresses.
