Volunteers have come out in force to support victims of domestic, family and gender-based violence, planting more than 200 native seedlings in Cotton Tree for Seeds of Hope.

Now in its third year, the community-based event took place today (7 December) as part of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence\*.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson thanked the community for volunteering and showing their support for this significant campaign.

“Our community continues to rally for victims of domestic and family violence and unite in solidarity by planting seedlings at this Seeds of Hope event, which has been made possible through council’s partnership with the Make It Stop committee,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The seedlings will rehabilitate and build resilience in our coastal dunes, while also acknowledging victims of domestic and family violence on the Sunshine Coast.

“Our community and our council has zero tolerance for domestic and family violence.”

Make It Stop Chairman Mark Kratzmann said it was great to see the event getting bigger and better with more people coming along each year and uniting for the mission.

“It’s a positive step to see people gathering and having conversations on such an important issue,” Mr Kratzmann said.

“Please know there is help available for anyone struggling and I encourage you to reach out and seek help.”
