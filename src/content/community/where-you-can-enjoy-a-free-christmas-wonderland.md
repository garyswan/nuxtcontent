A street party with all the trimmings, Twilight Markets and sparkling new lights … this seaside town is going to be full of Christmas cheer.

Locals, visitors and businesses are in for a treat as Caloundra hosts its festive celebrations.

Sunshine Coast Council, Downtown Caloundra Taskforce and The Caloundra Chamber of Commerce have joined forces to put on a massive FREE community event!

Caloundra’s biggest street party will be held in Bulcock Street on Friday, December 9, with the fun starting at 4pm.

Children can meet Santa, plus enjoy activities and face painting. Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy family time. Everyone is welcome!

Adjacent to Bulcock Street is Felicity Park, which is ready to sparkle with new festoon lighting zig-zagging across the green space.

This will brighten the stroll from the bustling main street to The Gallery, Bill Venardos Park and The Events Centre in Minchinton St.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said existing poles and buildings were utilised to minimise environmental impacts, with the community now provided a safer and more appealing park to enjoy.

“Felicity Park is a favourite for many families and visitors to the region and I encourage everyone to come down, take look and also support local businesses while they’re down there,” Cr Landsberg said.

“This project is another fantastic initiative supported by the Caloundra CBD Regulated Parking Fund which aims to improve and activate the Caloundra town centre. Co-funding via the Caloundra Centre Activation Project Capital assisted in the project completion.

“The project was completed ahead of the Christmas festivities planned for Caloundra and helps promote through-traffic and visitation to support the local economy.”

With extended shopping trade to support The Caloundra Christmas Street Party, visitors can grab an ice-cream and take a walk up Bulcock Street enjoying all the magical Christmas shopfronts. We are encouraging the community to pick their favourite shopfronts when voting throughout December, with Shop Caloundra Vouchers to be won.

4 Ingredients author and Caloundra identity Kim McCosker will host the Caloundra Christmas Street Party and introduce live music performances by Caloundra State High School, Caloundra State Primary School, Meridan State College, Aussie World Christmas, Caloundra Chorale, Golden Beach State School and Sunshine Coast Performing Arts College.  With the evening concluding with the official lighting of the tree.
