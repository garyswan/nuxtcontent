Chatting and reminiscing with friends always presents a wonderful time to share life’s stories and memories.

Taking the next steps to capture these stories in a memoir can seem daunting, however with the right tips and tools thanks to Sunshine Coast Libraries’ memoir writing workshop, it will be well worth the effort.

Proudly presented by Sunshine Coast Libraries in partnership with the Sunshine Coast Creative Writing Institute, the fun and interactive memoir writing workshop will be held at the Nambour RSL on Sunday, July 17, at 9am.

Aspiring writers are invited to join the hands-on session with award-winning authors Paul Williams and Shelley Davidow.

The six-hour workshop will reveal trade secrets on memoir writing, learn techniques to use dialogue to develop characters and how to push the plot along.

Participants will learn inspiring techniques to detail events from their own life to create a compelling narrative.

Sunshine Coast Libraries Coordinator Library Services Jane Stronach said biographies and memoirs have always been popular with library members being in the top ten most popular non-fiction catalogue categories.

“Library members have borrowed memoir-related titles over 99,120 times in the catalogues history,” Ms Stronach said.

“We look to the collection to shape our workshops for the community and our members. Libraries have been hosting a series of larger writing workshops with popular themes such as short stories and romance writing with experienced published authors and presenters.”

Memoir writing, which is different to an autobiography, is a reflection or collection of memories.

*The Diary of Anne Frank, Angela’s Ashes, Becoming by Michelle Obama* and of course the multi-million selling *Eat, Pray, Love* are all examples of how memoirs resonate with people.

The workshop is $50 per person with [registration](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/At-The-Library/Memoir-Writing)
