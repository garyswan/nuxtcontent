Caloundra is another step closer to a new transport connection into its CBD, with a consultant appointed to finish the detailed design and a new group of community representatives coming together to provide feedback on the project.

Aurecon has been announced as the detailed design consultant for Stage 2 of the Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade, connecting the CBD and Omrah Avenue to Nicklin Way.

The extension is being delivered between Third Avenue from Arthur Street to Nicklin Way, with a connection to Industrial Avenue.

 It will create a new access into the Caloundra CBD, reducing delays and congestion at the Caloundra Road/Nicklin Way roundabout.

As part of the design process, 10 community members have been selected to take part in a stakeholder interest group, which will provide important feedback that will be considered during a multi-criteria assessment of options.

The Stakeholder Interest Group will provide important community feedback, which will be considered as part of a multi-criteria assessment of options along with traffic, flood and stormwater modelling, environmental and cultural heritage investigations.

The group’s first meeting will take place next month (December).

The members were selected to reflect a range of ages, demographics and interest areas representing residents, motorists, transport operators, businesses and local facilities.

As the project progresses, the broader community will be kept informed of updated designs via regular updates and information available on the webpage.

The $18.2 million project is jointly funded by the Australian Government, Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council.

It is being delivered by Transport and Main Roads (TMR) and Sunshine Coast Council (SCC).

**Queensland Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey** said this project will make a big difference for motorists, bike riders, pedestrians and public transport users alike, so it’s great to see we’re a step closer to delivery.

"Feedback from the stakeholder interest group will play a key role during the design period, and help us make sure the road extension meets the needs of local residents," Minister Bailey said.

“This project is another great example of the Palaszczuk Government’s commitment to making it easier to move around Queensland.”

**Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg** said this is another way we can collaboratively work with the community and all tiers of government to advance the liveability of the Sunshine Coast in providing a new transport corridor that services our growing community’s needs.

“Community feedback about the impacts of the new transport link on Bicentennial Park is a key design consideration," Cr Landsberg said.

"A review of the link through the park has been undertaken with an intention to reduce the footprint as the project progresses through detailed design. 

“This project plays an important role in balancing the importance of safety, connectivity and community integration for Caloundra.”

Section 1 and 2 of the Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade.

**Queensland Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt** said we’re all about making it as easy as possible to get to and from the Caloundra CBD, which is why it’s so great to see a contractor locked in to deliver road extension.

“This project will ease pressure on local roads, as well as the Caloundra Road and Nicklin Way roundabout, reducing travel times in the area," MP Hunt said.

“It comes as part of the Palaszczuk Government’s over $3 billion four-year transport and roads plan for the Sunshine Coast, supporting 2,700 good, secure jobs.

“We’re continuing to deliver for Sunshine Coast residents, helping them spend less time behind the wheel and more enjoying the great Queensland lifestyle.”

**Jackie Steele, member of the stakeholder interest group (and member for Caloundra Residents Association)** said it's great to see the SIG for this project getting off the ground.

"There are many questions and concerns that people have about this project such as how it fits into the bigger picture, and how the benefits of it are achieved while the things important to the community are protected or enhanced in the process," Ms Steele said.

"I look forward to actively participating in the SIG in a positive and productive way by sharing information and contributing perspectives from the Caloundra Residents Association membership and broader networks to get the best outcome for the community."

Detailed design is expected to be completed in late 2023, with construction to follow.

The project is due to be complete in late 2025, weather and construction conditions permitting.
