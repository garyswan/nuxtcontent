A major piece of transport infrastructure is being carefully positioned into place along a popular Sunshine Coast road, heralding a significant milestone in a long-awaited project.

Motorists and residents will have a front seat view as a 250 tonne crane lifts concrete sections – known as deck units – into place for the remaining two lanes of the new four lane bridge at Mayes Canal, Mooloolaba.

The opening of four traffic lanes north of the Mayes Canal Bridge just before Christmas ran smoothly throughout the holiday period and will soon extend south.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said he looked forward to the four lanes over Mayes Canal being completed as part of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade Stage 2 works.

“If you’re travelling along Brisbane Road, you may have caught a glimpse of the large crane which has moved into position near the bowls club,” Cr Natoli said.

“The crane will lift 75 precast reinforced concrete deck units which will form the bridge span.

“To minimise inconvenience to the community the deck units were made off-site and craned in as part of the 26.4-metre-wide bridge – an incredible process you can [watch here](https://youtu.be/pa-4Vc8VgkQ)
.”

This month (February) construction crews have been busy finalising the installation of the bridge piers and abutments ahead of the deck units arriving.

Once the deck units are in place a reinforced concrete slab will be laid to provide a uniform surface to construct the new road. Asphalt laying, and line marking will follow before the traffic lanes are open to the community in May 2023 (weather permitting).

When the MTCU project is complete, the new bridge will feature four traffic lanes (two lanes each way), a shared pedestrian and cycle paths on both sides and a timber viewing platform.

It will have the same clearance as the current bridge.

Landscaping treatments will complement the bridge and connect it to the riverbank, parkland and existing pedestrian pathways.

As part of a significant green makeover, the completed Brisbane Road Upgrade project will also incorporate 232 new trees and 8850 plants.

Crane location and western lanes of new Mayes Canal Bridge currently under construction – Brisbane Road.

“This project is going to improve traffic flow, enhance the southern entrance into Mooloolaba and create a corridor that is inviting for pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and public transport users,” Cr Natoli said.

“I would like to extend my thanks to the project team who remained flexible in the lead up to the Christmas break, and to thank locals and businesses for your ongoing patience and cooperation during construction and the year ahead.”

These works are benefitting from a $12 million investment from the Australian Government.
