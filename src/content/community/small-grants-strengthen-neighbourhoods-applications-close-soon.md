Community groups who need a little bit of funding to help strengthen their local neighbourhood should get cracking and apply for a Sunshine Coast Council Minor Grant today.

Applications are now open and close 4 May for this Community Grants Program round, which supports eligible not-for-profit groups with up to $2000 to make happen those one-off projects, events and activities that benefit the Sunshine Coast community.

More than $120,000 in total is up for grabs.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged people to apply now for projects that encouraged volunteering and prepared our communities to gather over the summer.

“We want to support projects that reactivate the community in a resilient and vibrant way, inject money into the local economy and are ready to get started and be successfully completed,” Cr Law said.

“Community groups and their volunteers contribute to connecting, activating and strengthening our neighbourhoods, which builds a stronger community.

“This is the perfect time for organised community groups who like to forward plan to secure funding for festive season celebrations that reactivate our community in a COVID-19 safe way, with applicants to know an outcome in mid-June.”

Past recipients of council’s Minor Grants include Coolum Business and Tourism Incorporated for their Flicks in the Park, a series of movies screened at Tickle Park during the Spring and Summer holidays.

Coolum Business and Tourism President Mark Cameron said the movie events strengthened Coolum’s holiday community, an eclectic mix of the local neighbourhood and holiday-makers.

“The seed of a council minor grant, along with sponsorship from business, helps us to bring the local community and holiday-makers together to celebrate a uniquely coastal experience – outdoor movies by the sea,” Mr Cameron said.
