Join in with some of our Clean Ocean Champions and lend a hand to clean up litter and marine debris from our Sunshine Coast beaches in May and June.

And remember, even if you can't join in this time, whenever you are out in our beautiful environment, please safely pick up any litter you see.

Even just one piece can make a difference.
