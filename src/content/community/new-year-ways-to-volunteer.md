Start the new year on a high note and gift your time.  

Volunteering provides an opportunity for you to be involved in activities reflecting your interests and using your skills, while building a stronger and connected community.

Council provides a supportive and safe working environment for volunteers and has a range of opportunities available for those willing to help in their spare time. You can volunteer at a museum, at events, in Council libraries and galleries or even as a BushCare or TurtleCare volunteer.

Surprising benefits\* of volunteering include:

*   Life satisfaction
*   Feeling happier
*   Feeling healthier
*   Getting a “helper’s high”
*   Feeling a sense of belonging
*   Catching feel-good emotions
*   Embracing your passions
