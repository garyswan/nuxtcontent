Bullumby our critically endangered loggerhead turtle is there NOW!

She left our shores in December and began heading north. Our tracking map shows that she has now reached PNG.

This is such fantastic data and represents a migration range that hasn’t been recorded before for Sunshine Coast Loggerhead Turtles.

Loggerhead turtles nesting in eastern Australia are known to live in PNG waters, with tag recoveries (where a tag has been sent in from a location) spanning many years.

Bullumby the endangered Loggerhead Turtle

Interestingly, she has not foraged (eaten) since leaving her foraging ground in September/October 2022.

The female turtles migrate, nest and then migrate back without feeding.

Then they spend the news few years building the body condition to breed again.

You can track Bullumby’s movements [HERE](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/environment/native-animals/turtlecare/resources/tracking-sea-turtles)
