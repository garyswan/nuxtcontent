Residents of one of the fastest growing communities in Queensland will have the chance shape the future of Aura.

Sunshine Coast Council is inviting people who live, work or play in Aura to participate in the *Our People, Our Places, Our Aura* engagement program between June 8 and July 23.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said this was an opportunity for residents to tell council what the community envisions Aura’s future to look like, and how community venues play a part in that.

“This is a really exciting project and we’re calling on Aura residents to tell us your ideas, visions and dreams for your vibrant community,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Local public spaces will be activated with pop-up events, you can participate in the community workshop, or you can contribute online by completing the survey or submitting a photo or story.

“We’re asking the kids to get involved too! They will be able to take an online quiz and find out which cool ‘Sunny Coast’ character they’re like.”

The four Sunny Coast characters include:

*   Sustainable Scout – Scout loves nature and being outdoors
*   Smart Stevie – Stevie loves to learn, experiment, and use new technology
*   Creative Chanda – Chanda loves any chance to show a creative flair
*   Healthy Haru – Haru loves to be active.

Keep an eye out for these characters popping up around the neighbourhood.
