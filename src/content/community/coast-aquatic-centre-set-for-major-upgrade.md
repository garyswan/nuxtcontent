More than $6 million will be splashed on a range of improvements to one of the Sunshine Coast’s prominent aquatic centres.

Sunshine Coast Council has appointed local building firm Murphy Builders as the primary building contractor to deliver Stage One works for the Kawana Aquatic Centre at Bokarina.

Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said the much-needed upgrade would enhance the Coast’s capacity to accommodate aquatic sporting groups and attract patronage from across the region, the country – and even the globe.

“The Kawana Aquatic Centre is an important swimming facility for our region,” Cr Cox said.

“It already attracts more than 200,000 visitors per year with a vast number of residents taking advantage of the reputable swim school and squad training, as well as travelling sporting groups – and demand for our facility continues to grow.

“The centre is part of our thriving sporting heart – supporting the nearby Sunshine Coast Stadium and broader Kawana Sports Precinct.

“Together these facilities host many local, national, and international sporting events, training camps and competitions each year.

“With more than 500,000 people expected to call the Sunshine Coast home by 2041, these sporting facilities are essential to the liveability of our region and will ensure our community has access to world-class sporting amenities close to home.”

Existing undercover pool and indoor learn to swim pools to be replaced as part of Stage 1.

Tourism, Events and Sport Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said Stage One of the multiple-year upgrade would include a new 20 metre undercover pool along with improved structures, plant, and operating equipment.

“The existing undercover pool has reached the end of its useable life and will be replaced with a modern and more accessible facility,” Cr O’Pray said.

“We will take this opportunity to incorporate environmentally considerate operating systems including state-of-the-art controls and a roof-mounted, solar photovoltaic system for power generation.

“As part of future works, council will also deliver a new entry building, children’s water play areas, public amenities, a refurbished kiosk and improved car parking.

“The first of three construction stages is now underway with works taking place over several years to minimise the impact on patrons and the pool lessee, City Venue Management”.

The hugely popular council-owned aquatic centre offers a range of facilities and programs for all ages and abilities.

It features a 50-metre outdoor pool, 25-metre pool with dive/water polo pool, and a dedicated learn-to-swim facility with all-abilities access hoist. There is also an array of children’s play pools.

The Kawana Aquatic Centre is one of nine council-owned aquatic centres across our region. The other aquatic centres are located at Beerwah, Caloundra, Buderim, Cotton Tree, Coolum, Palmwoods, Nambour, and Eumundi.

All facilities are operated by council contract partners who provide the day-to-day site operation, programming, and access for the community.
