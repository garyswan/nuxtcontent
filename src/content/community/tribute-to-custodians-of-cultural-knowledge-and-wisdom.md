Our “trailblazers, nurturers and Custodians of cultural knowledge and wisdom’’ have been honoured at a special ceremony.

Speaking at Sunshine Coast Council’s annual Flag Raising Ceremony, held as part of NAIDOC Week 2023 celebrations, Mayor Mark Jamieson paid tribute to First Nations Elders past, present and emerging.

### Mayor Jamieson told the ceremony, held at Nambour on Wednesday, July 5, that our Elders had played and continued to play a vital role in our communities and families.

“The annual ceremony is a way to honour our Elders, who have made such a profound difference to the way we live through their advocacy and activism,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“They are the Custodians of cultural knowledge and wisdom, trailblazers, nurturers, advocates, teachers, survivors, leaders and loved ones.

“We pay our respects to the Elders we’ve lost and show our support for those who continue to inspire change across the country.

“For many years Sunshine Coast Council has remained committed to strengthening working relationships with First Nations peoples and advancing reconciliation.

### “Together, we thrive.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said more than 100 people attended the ceremony at Council’s Nambour Administration Building.

“With NAIDOC Week now in full swing, there are a range of fun and educational events happening across the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Law said.
