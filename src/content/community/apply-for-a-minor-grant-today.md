Does your community organisation need funding to help make something great happen?

Make it a reality with support from Council’s Community Grants Program.

Not-for-profit organisations can apply for up to $2000 to deliver one-off projects, events and activities that provide community benefit.

The Program aims to acknowledge and strengthen the valuable contribution that community groups and their volunteers make towards achieving our shared vision and goal of being Australia's most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative and fostering a strong community.

Applications close November 2 2021. Visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Minor-Grants)
&#x20;for more information and to apply online.
