The vibrant streetscape of Woombye exudes historic county charm thanks to recent upgrades along Blackall Street.

The project has transformed the community’s vision for an attractive and vibrant township whilst honouring the town’s golden charm.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston thanked the community for its ongoing support and patience during construction.

“[The Woombye Heritage Trail](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/museums-and-places/walks/woombye-heritage-trail)
&#x20;is a source of great pride for the local community, and I am excited to see the completed streetscape works honour the towns unique story,” Cr Johnston said.

“This upgrade includes shady street trees and garden beds planted to cool the footpath, beautify, and extend the green, leafy look and feel, to the west of the town centre.

“Locals and visitors can now enjoy outdoor dining and support businesses along the western end of the street and utilise the new seating areas and streetscape amenities.

“The completed works create a pedestrian-friendly street by improving footpaths and crossings, making it safer to cross the street, slowing traffic and improving access for all abilities.’’

Cr Johnston said that since November 2020, extensive community engagement had informed the streetscape design and deliver a central space for the community to gather in front of the School of Arts Hall.

Member for Nicklin Rob Skelton said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to support the Woombye streetscape with $500,000 in South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program funding.

“The Palaszczuk Government is proudly delivering for Woombye and the Sunshine Coast with this investment in our historic town,” Mr Skelton said.

“Woombye is a must-travel to destination in our region thanks to its charm and rich history, by investing in the streetscape we’re making it even better to live and to visit.

“This is all part of the Palaszczuk Government’s commitment to our lifestyle, with investments like this we’re making it even better.”

Throughout the streetscaping project Sunshine Coast Council collaborated with Woombye Community and Business Association and the Woombye Heritage Group to embed the heritage trail into the significant streetscape project.

Woombye Community and Business Association Vice President Grant Palethorpe said the community was thrilled to see the project completed and honour the town’s history.

“The Woombye community is very proud of its heritage and delighted to share the area’s wonderful story with locals and visitors,” Mr Palethorpe said.

“It is a true celebration to see the Woombye Heritage Trail come to life through this collaborative streetscape project and we encourage everyone to explore the trail and all that the town has to offer.”

In 2018, Woombye celebrated 150 years since the first Cobb & Co coach commenced the Brisbane to Gympie journey.

The Woombye Heritage Trail offers a wealth of historic sites, buildings and art installations dedicated to the history of the town that we hope future generations will enjoy along with the idyllic streetscape.

Collaboration between Council the Woombye School of Arts Hall committee also lead to an upgrade to the front of the lower hall to tie in with the streetscape upgrade, funded through a grant from the Queensland Government’s Gambling and Community Benefit fund. This project is proudly funded by the Queensland Government’s South-East Queensland Community Stimulus Program, in association with Council.
