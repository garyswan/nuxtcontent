More than 200 residents, business owners and visitors provided valuable feedback on the Draft Streetscape Concept Design for Memorial Drive, Eumundi.

Between 14 March and 22 April 2022, the Eumundi community were asked to have their say on the streetscape design and let Council know ‘Have we got it right?’.

Stage 2 community feedback has been summarised in the below ‘snapshot’ drawn from the survey. This and other community feedback received will assist in further refinement of the design during the detailed design stage.
