A community-led design has been released by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) for Stage 6 of the Mooloolaba to Maroochydore cycleway project.

In 2020, TMR and Sunshine Coast Council undertook extensive 12-week consultation on Stage 6 of the cycleway. Read more about the [M2M Cycleway consultation period extended](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/M2M-Cycleway-consultation-period-extended-280520)
.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said community input for the cycleway had been invaluable.

“The Mooloolaba to Maroochydore Cycleway is being rolled out in stages, and we are now working towards the next 1.2-kilometre stretch between Mary Street at Alexandra Headland and Sixth Avenue at Maroochydore,” Mr Bailey said.

"We called on local residents to have their say, and their feedback has played a key role in making sure the design meets their needs.

"The final planning layout includes a five-metre-wide shared path to cater for all active transport modes, from bike users to parents pushing prams.

"This design balances the needs of all and will help create a vibrant, active community for many years to come."

Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the plans addressed feedback on several key themes, including:

*   improved safety
*   the importance of beachside car parking spaces
*   maintaining flexible pedestrian movements
*   protecting dune areas
*   the width and surface of the path.

"Importantly, the overall number of beachside car parks has not changed in the final planning layout," Mr Hunt said.

"The plan includes a new beachside car park near the intersection of Alexandra Parade and Sixth Avenue, which will have accessible and motorbike spaces.

“Releasing the design is great news for local residents, and I’m looking forward to seeing more progress on this important project.”

Mr Hunt said the project was a great example of the Palaszczuk Government’s commitment to improving transport options on the Sunshine Coast.

“We’re delivering over $3 billion worth of road and transport infrastructure projects across the Sunshine Coast and surrounding areas over the next four years,” he said.

“This project is great news for the community, who will no doubt enjoy the new path when complete.”

Mr Bailey said the cycleway formed part of a $270 million, four-year active transport plan for Queensland.

“We know for every dollar we invest in bike-riding infrastructure there’s an average return of five dollars in economic benefit to Queensland, through improved health outcomes, reduced traffic congestion and lower transport costs,” Mr Bailey said.

“Labor is getting on with making active transport even easier, which is great news for Queenslanders.”
