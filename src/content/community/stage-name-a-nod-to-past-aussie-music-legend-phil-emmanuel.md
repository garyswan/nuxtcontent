He was the late, great muso who not only played the guitar but made it sing with his off-the-charts strumming, and today former Buderim resident Phil Emmanuel OAM, who sadly passed away in 2018 at age 66, was honoured with the unveiling of the newly named Phil Emmanuel Stage at Buderim Village Park.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford unveiled the new plaque today (September 28) at an intimate ceremony with Phil’s family and close friends.

“Council received and approved an application to officially name this amphitheatre at Buderim Village Park the ‘Phil Emmanuel Stage’ and what a fitting tribute this is to such a dedicated musician who gave so much to so many,” Cr Hungerford said.

“It’s recognition of Phil’s significant contribution to the local community through his music and mentoring of local artists.

“He also volunteered for several charities and cared deeply about the environment.”

Phil’s wife Amanda Emmanuel said she was proud to see the stage dedicated to Phil.

“He was the happiest when he was on stage,” Amanda said.

“Phil really was the master of the guitar and tone. They used to call him ‘the tone master’. He used to make the guitar sing, he didn’t sing himself and he didn’t need to.

“Not a lot of people knew how dedicated he was. He was a great guitarist, but he also did a lot of one-on-ones and he used to play with the local musicians if they asked him to. They’re all better musicians because Phil played with them.

“I think this stage naming is really the start of something special for Phil, for his legacy to carry on. We really hope future concerts can be held here with up-and-coming musicians.”

Stage-naming applicant Carole Beck said she was honouring a promise to Phil.

“This really means a lot to me because I made a promise to him that he would never be forgotten,” Carole said.

“He contributed so much to this country through his music.

“Phil grew up in country towns and loved the bush. It’s those in the bush who don’t get much in the way of entertainment let alone someone of Phil’s calibre coming to their town, so he was loved and appreciated by many for doing this and for just being one of them.”  

Phil played with the likes of Hank Marvin, The Doobie Brothers and Carlos Santana. He sadly passed away in 2018 from an asthma attack.
