Traditional Custodians, the Sunshine Coast First Nations community and council representatives have met on Jinibara lands to launch National Reconciliation Week.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was committed to continuing to engage in meaningful action to further reconciliation in our region.

“Today was a great opportunity to gather together, build strong and respectful relationships between First Nations people and non-First Nations people, celebrate the start of National Reconciliation Week and the achievements, commitments and partnerships with the First Nations community,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Sunshine Coast Council was the first local government in Queensland to have developed a Reconciliation Action Plan in partnership with Reconciliation Australia in 2011.

“Our Sunshine Coast Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan 2021-22 continues to place a high priority on building strong collaborations and partnerships and supporting social and economic opportunities for the First Nations community.

“The Sunshine Coast local region has a rich First Nations history and I look forward to seeing the RAP work to support a shared future that embraces culture, heritage and diversity.”

Community Development Portfolio Councillor David Law said reconciliation was a long journey we must undertake together.

“This year’s National Reconciliation Week theme, *Be Brave Make Change*, asks us to make change, beginning with brave actions in our daily lives, as we all have a role to play in working towards reconciliation,” Cr Law said.

“We must all commit to learning about our shared histories and exploring how each of us can contribute to achieving reconciliation in Australia.

“Council is committed to continuing to prioritise meaningful and collaborative working relationships with Traditional Custodians and First Nations people within our region to build a strong, inclusive and connected community on the Sunshine Coast.”
