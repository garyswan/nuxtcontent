Sunshine Coast Council is joining outreach providers to shine a light on the challenges faced by vulnerable community members and provide support information across the region.

An outreach program will deliver a range of services, support and information from next week, highlighting the help that is available to Sunshine Coast people experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless.

The program will be delivered by Sunshine Coast Housing and Homelessness Network and supported by Sunshine Coast Council. No registration is required to attend the following information sessions from 10am-2pm:

*   Nambour Community Centre, 2 Shearer St, Nambour, on 5 August
*   Caloundra Community Centre, 58A Queen St, Caloundra, on 10 August
*   Maleny Neighbourhood Centre, 17 Bicentenary Lane, Maleny, on 12 August.  

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the information sessions would provide recommendations on how to access public or social housing, private rentals, support services and also hardship support.

“Council is partnering with the State Government, community services and local housing providers to address homelessness, as prioritised in our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The information sessions will also support the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census Inclusive Strategies Team with their Homelessness Enumeration project.

“Council will work closely with the ABS team in the lead up to Census night on 10 August 2021 to identify known rough-sleeping locations in council-managed spaces.”

Coast2Bay Community Engagement Officer Charlotte Buckley invited vulnerable community members to access this information at a location close to them.

“Services will be able to provide information under one roof because this is a community response - there is not just one answer to the current issues,” she said.

Nambour Community Centre Coordinator and Social Worker Angela Rondo said the community centre had become an essential support service to many people who are rough-sleeping and offered support to people facing housing stress and risk of homelessness.

“We welcome the community to connect and engage with our activities and access facilities such as showers, washing machine, tea, coffee and food,” Ms Rondo said. 

“Ending homelessness requires a whole-of-community response.

“The face of homelessness is dominated by women, children and our ageing population.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged people to come forward and access information and support in one central place.

“Council is aware there are a growing number of people experiencing housing pressure and we want to make sure support is available where it is needed most,” Cr Law said.
