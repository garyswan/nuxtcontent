This Sunday June 5 will see the Coolum Civic Centre and adjoining Jack Morgan Park transform into a family friendly fun day to celebrate the 50th United Nations, World Environment Day (WED).

Come and enjoy some of the finest eco-tainment on the Sunshine Coast with local musicians, including the highly energised guitar artistry and heartfelt melodies of SoLar, indie-folk duos’ JC and the Tree plus Anna & Jordan, as well as the soft silky tones and high energy rhythms of Solua.

A jam-packed program will let you choose from a range of hands-on eco-art experiences designed to delight the young and young-at-heart.

Or you can wander the exhibits and soak up the latest in ideas for sustainable living and local environment and sustainability programs.

Stay for an hour or stay for the day - this event will keep the whole family entertained.\
Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said the region was lucky to have so many dedicated environment groups.

“They have been undertaking transformative actions for many years and this significant day is an acknowledgement of the great work they do,” Cr Suarez said.

“They contribute to the environment and start conversations for future ideas and actions.\
“It’s exciting to think that this year marks 50 years of this event and that’s certainly something to celebrate.”
