It’s great news for 138 Sunshine Coast community organisations with their local council putting up $990,000 to give them a helping hand this financial year.

Sporting groups, community halls, chambers of commerce, industry groups, coast guards, animal refuges, creative arts peak bodies, community centres, museums and cultural heritage groups are among the well-established not-for-profit organisations developing strong relationships with Sunshine Coast Council through its Community Partnership Funding Program.

Currimundi Sport and Recreation Association (CSRA) manages the Currimundi Hall and will receive annual funding of $4000 towards their operational costs in this program. 

CSRA President Rhondda Alexander said the Community Partnership Funding Program had breathed life into the Currimundi Hall when they first joined the program in 2016. 

“Before we were a part of the Community Partnership (Funding) Program, we couldn’t really afford our insurance, but we managed because it was needed,” Ms Alexander said

“The first three-year grant saved the hall, as we didn’t have as many renters then, and membership numbers had dropped.”

Council’s Community Partnership Funding Program will again contribute $4000 each year, for three years, towards the association’s insurance.

“Because the Community Partnership runs for three years, we could accumulate enough reserve for much needed maintenance projects,” Ms Alexander said.

The Currimundi Hall is now thriving with fresh paint, a vibrant First Nations mural depicting local flying foxes and nesting turtles, and a full program of community activity.

“I’ve fallen in love with the hall. It’s a restful place, surrounded by trees… and it feels nice inside.

“It’s a hub for Currimundi, Wurtulla, Dicky Beach and Aroona residents; hosting line dancing, thai chi, indoor bowls, meditation and more.”

Fifteen organisations use Currimundi Hall for weekly activities.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said council’s new cycle of multi-year operational funding endorsed today (19 August) strengthened council’s relationships with many invaluable volunteer organisations.

“By contributing to operational costs such as rent, communications and administration, the program gives community groups funding certainty,” Cr Law said.

“That means they can invest their time and energy into providing vital services to their members and the broader community.”

Sunshine Coast Community Cooperative, which builds capacity for a wide range of other community committees, received funding in the Community Development category.

“This group of experienced board members connects community committee members to share experience and upskill in things such as governance and how to run an effective committee through a program called the Sunshine Coast Coalition of Community Boards,” Cr Law said.

“The group helps volunteers to push through what seems daunting at first, with the support of a network and workshops.

“Volunteers learn how to be great treasurers or secretaries, and this enables them to deliver great services to their community.”

Sunshine Coast Coalition of Community Boards Coordinator Mark Wischnat said securing council funding allowed an additional workshop and development opportunities to be run which helped retain volunteers. 

“We could not provide the support we do without the council funding, and sharing ideas gives you a feeling you are not alone and shows you there are many ways to solve one problem,” Mr Wischnat said.

“The Coalition of Community Boards fills the gap in training, support and development opportunities for volunteer committee members.\
 \
“This is important as committee volunteer roles in organisations not only enable the organisation to be sustained but individually these roles provide us with purpose and challenges to grow.”

Eligible organisations in council’s Community Partnership Funding Program provide facilities or services that support the delivery of council's priorities and demonstrate broad community benefit. Partners join one of five categories:
