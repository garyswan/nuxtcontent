If you’re searching for a sweet spot for little ones to run off their energy at, check out this new-look playground in the Cordellia St Park at Coolum Beach.

What a transformation! The old playground has been replaced with a funky new multi play unit, rubber softfall at the swing set and slide exit and a top-up of bark softfall all around.

There’s also swish new turf, a sandstone block retaining wall and concrete edging around the perimeter.  

Tucked away in a residential area, this green and shady peaceful pocket is the perfect park for a picnic and play.
