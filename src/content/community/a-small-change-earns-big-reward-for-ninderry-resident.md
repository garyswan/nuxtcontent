Making the switch to receiving rates notices by email instead of traditional post has paid off for a Ninderry resident who is the latest lucky winner of Sunshine Coast Council’s ‘Win Your Rates’ competition.

Melody will have her next rates bill paid after being drawn as the winner of the competition, which ran from 22 July to 25 August.

“I switched over to receiving my rate notices by email in January. I care so much about climate change and while this may seem a small thing, it’s a simple choice for me to make.

“The process was so smooth through MyCouncil, and receiving my rates by email makes paying my rates convenient and easy. If we each make the choice to do it together, we could help to make a positive impact,” Melody said.

“I am absolutely thrilled to be the lucky winner of council’s ‘Win your rates’ competition! I’m looking forward to putting this towards hopefully being able to travel to Melbourne at Christmas to see my mum, who I haven’t seen for almost two years now.”

Sunshine Coast Council Finance Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said the aim of council’s ‘Win Your Rates’ competition was to encourage Sunshine Coast rate payers to make the change to receiving their rate notices electronically rather than via traditional postal services.

“Council is always looking for ways to operate in a more environmentally friendly way and help to create a healthy, smart and creative lifestyle here on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Hungerford said.

“Moving to an online system enables ratepayers to receive their rate notices wherever they are, anywhere in the world and arrange payment in a convenient and timely manner.

“Owners of around 33,000 properties in total have made the change to receive their rate notices electronically and I encourage ratepayers who are still receiving their notices in the post to visit council’s website, sign up to [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or login to their existing MyCouncil account and change your preferred rates notice delivery method from post to email.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account and changing your preferred rates notice delivery method on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
. There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;to show you how to change your rates delivery method from traditional post to email.

For rate enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
