Purpose-built sporting courts and fields, nature trails and dog-friendly facilities, active youth and play spaces, wetland experiences and community events – these are just some of the future sporting, recreation and community opportunities on the cards for Honey Farm Sport and Recreation Precinct at Meridan Plains.

Sunshine Coast Council endorsed the Honey Farm Sport and Recreation Precinct Master Plan at today’s (Thursday 25 March) Ordinary Meeting.

Divisional Councillor Peter Cox said the master plan provided a vision to create a sport and recreation precinct that promoted a healthy, smart and creative community.

“This is a significant multi-use sport and recreation precinct which will provide a wealth of benefits for the entire Sunshine Coast community to be involved in active sports, outdoor recreation and a range of events,” Cr Cox said.

“I’m pleased to see council unanimously endorsed the master plan which provides for a highly functional, 75 hectare regional sports facility, a unique district recreation park for all ages and abilities and embraces best-practice for climate-responsive design to take advantage of our subtropical climate and lifestyle.

“This precinct will become a place for everyone to enjoy as it’s been shaped by our community, for our community.

“Last year between 24 June and 24 July, we asked residents to tell us their thoughts on the master plan. This feedback found that 84 per cent of respondents supported the draft plan and in response to feedback, the draft plan was refined to meet the needs of the community.

“Most of the feedback found sporting fields and courts were the most important feature of the plan, closely followed by the youth activity-node and criterium cycling course.

“We also received feedback to consider the land for a range of non-sporting events. So council looked into this through an event assessment process, which determined the site has a potential capacity to hold up to 30,000 patrons – a fantastic result to increase tourism and community events in the area.”

Honey Farm Sport and Recreation Precinct is one of many major infrastructure projects council is delivering in-line with the [Environment and Liveability Strategy](https://els.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, which provides long-term direction to guide growth and shape the region’s future. 

The facility’s development on Honey Farm Road will be staged in line with council’s 10 Year Capital Works Program along with external funding opportunities sought from the State and Federal Governments.

Council has previously approved budget allocation of $3.75 million in the 2020/21 financial year to start early works for this project. Initial earthworks, access roads and service connections are well-underway.
