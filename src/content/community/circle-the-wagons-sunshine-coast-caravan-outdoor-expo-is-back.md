If you’re planning to hit the road for a getaway, there’s no better place to start than Caravanning Queensland’s Let’s Go Sunshine Coast Caravan & Outdoor Expo from Friday, August 19 to Sunday, August 21 at the Nambour Showgrounds.

Following a hiatus in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID, one of the Sunshine Coast’s largest caravan, camping and outdoor events will return with more than 80 exhibitors showcasing an enormous range of caravans, camper trailers, motorhomes, campervans, gadgets and accessories for your next big road trip or weekend getaway.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said caravanning was a terrific way to explore our region and venture further afield.

“The Sunshine Coast has some of the most picturesque and interesting natural assets, such as our  beautiful hinterland regions and world-class beaches, and caravanning and camping is the perfect way to experience these wonderful natural areas,” Cr Law said.

“So I encourage everyone to get along to the Nambour Showgrounds from August 19 to August 21 to get some ideas and inspiration for your next holiday – whether it’s within our wonderful region, another part of Queensland or interstate.

“This is one of more than 35 annual events the Nambour Showgrounds plays host to, including festivals, trade shows, car clubs, sporting events and major events like the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show, the Queensland Garden Expo, the Antique Car Club Swap Meet and the Nambour Expo.

“These events attract around 200,000 visitors to the Sunshine Coast each year, benefiting our local economy.”

Caravan Trade and Industries Association of Queensland CEO Jason Plant said the Sunshine Coast had become one of Australia’s top destinations for caravan and camping visitors over recent years.

“In addition to this, caravan sales within the Sunshine Coast region have doubled over the last 12 months,” Mr Plant said.

“So we’re extremely excited to be able to bring Caravanning Queensland’s Let’s Go Sunshine Coast Caravan & Outdoor Expo back to Nambour in 2022 to provide people with more opportunities to create their own terrific outdoor experiences.”

The Let’s Go Sunshine Coast Caravan & Outdoor Expo is a family-friendly event that will include free activities like sheep dog trials, face painting and campfire cooking demonstrations with a side of bush poetry and ballads from Ranger Nick.

The popular Weight and Towing Masterclasses will be back again, providing travellers with vital information and tips from industry experts to ensure everyone hits the road on their next adventure safely and with confidence.

Visitors attending the Let’s Go Sunshine Coast Caravan & Outdoor Expo will also be able to go in the draw to win a myCOOLMAN explorer fridge freezer valued at $1944, simply by scanning the three designated QR Codes onsite.
