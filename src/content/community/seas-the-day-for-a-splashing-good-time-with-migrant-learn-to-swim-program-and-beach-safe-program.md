Sunshine Coast migrant residents are invited to apply for their chance to attend low-cost\* learn-to-swim classes.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said while residents were lucky to live in such a beautiful part of the world on the Sunshine Coast, with so many water-based activities on offer water safety was paramount. 

“Everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy our wonderful lifestyle and the Migrant Learn to Swim and Beach Safe Program incorporates water safety and water confidence techniques along with basic swimming lessons,” Cr Law said.

“Council, in partnership with the Royal Life Saving Society Queensland, will once again be offering the highly successful program, which also includes a beach safety session, during October, November and December.

“Please submit your expression of interest today! [Applications](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Multicultural-Welcome-Hub/Health-and-Wellbeing-Services/Migrant-Learn-to-Swim)
&#x20;are now open and close Monday, October 3.”

Royal Life Saving Society Queensland Executive Director Paul Barry encouraged migrants to have a go and register for the program.

“This program promotes healthy, active and skilled communities and is open to migrant residents, including those with limited swimming skills,” Mr Barry said.

“It not only teaches participants how to swim, it also teaches techniques, such as floating and survival techniques.

“At the beach safety session participants will learn vital beach safety skills about the ocean, rips, currents and safe and unsafe swimming locations.”

Previous participant Giovanna completed the Migrant Learn to Swim Program after moving to the Sunshine Coast from Bolivia, South America.

“I never learnt to swim in my country and after looking for somewhere to start I found this program,” Giovanna said.

“It was a great place to meet other migrants like me, and learn swimming techniques together. 

“The beach safety session was a nice experience and people were very friendly and patient while teaching us.”

Classes include mixed female and male as well as women’s only classes and will be offered at Nambour Aquatic Centre and Goodlife Community Centre, Buderim.

The program will start on Saturday, October 8 with a welcome session. The learn-to-swim sessions start on Saturday, October 15 and are held for seven weeks.

Learn beach safety awareness with trained Royal Life Saving Society Queensland lifeguards at the Caloundra City Life Saving Club (Ithaca), Bulcock Beach Caloundra on Saturday, 3 December to complete the program.
