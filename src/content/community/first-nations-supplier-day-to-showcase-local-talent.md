Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson has urged the local community to show their support for the inaugural First Nations Supplier Day on Monday, November 15, in Caloundra.

Dozens of local First Nations suppliers will feature their products and services at the free event at BeachTree Distilling Co. 14 Industrial Ave, Caloundra West, from 3-8pm.

Mayor Jamieson said the Supplier Day was a great opportunity for businesses and the community to come together and strengthen First Nations relationships.

“One of the key objectives of the Inaugural Sunshine Coast First Nations Supplier Day is to establish a platform to showcase local First Nations businesses and their ongoing contributions to the economic fabric of the Sunshine Coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“By reinforcing the connections between First Nations suppliers, government agencies and non-government organisations, this event aims to showcase the work of local First Nations businesses and provide them with an opportunity to become a supplier of choice for a number of goods and services.”

BeachTree Distilling Co. Manager Kirra Daley said she was proud to host the First Nations Supplier event.

“It will give other First Nations businesses a place to come together and yarn about who they are and celebrate their journey so far,” Ms Daley said.

“\[This] creates opportunities for community support, brand awareness, establishing relationships and is an opportunity to share your journey with potential clients and vendors.

“It is exciting to think about the collaborations that can also come from events like these that bring the First Nations community together.”

Due to COVID Safe guidelines, tickets must be purchased to this free event. <https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/sunshine-coast-first-nations-supplier-day-tickets-170263385369>
