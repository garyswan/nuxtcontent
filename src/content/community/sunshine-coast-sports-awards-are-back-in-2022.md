Sunshine Coast Sports is excited to relaunch the Sunshine Coast Sports Awards in 2022 with nominations now open for Quarter 1.

The Sunshine Coast Sports Awards recognise the outstanding achievements of athletes and teams, officials, coaches, volunteers, administrators, and clubs and associations from grass roots to high performance.

The awards return this year with new categories and both quarterly and annual awards on offer, nominations for Quarter 1 close on April 7th.

A strong history on the Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast Sports have been championing young athletes for over 50 years and exists to support, enable, advocate and fundraise on behalf of sport in the Sunshine Coast and Noosa Council regions.

Sunshine Coast Sports was re-launched in 2021 with a vision to be a respected independent, community sport minded, regional body that champions and supports grass roots sport on the Sunshine Coast, promoting participation and enabling athletes to achieve their goals and aspirations.

This year they are excited to relaunch the awards that recognise the achievements of our local sporting community that Shine Bright across the calendar year.

Sunshine Coast Sports incoming chair Simone Pearce said she was excited to relaunch the awards and celebrate young athletes and the broader sporting community after a tough few years for community sport.

“We’re excited to relaunch the awards to recognise those who shine bright within the sporting community year-round.” Simone said.

“Sport matters, it inspires everyone, enables health and well-being, and educates us on the importance of being truly inclusive for everyone in our community.

After the last few years we recognise the importance of providing support to grass roots sport by promoting participation and enabling athletes to achieve their goals.”\
Sunshine Coast Sports are also thrilled to have the continued support of Sunshine Coast Council through the ‘Train Sunshine Coast’ initiative and its Community Partnerships Program along with the support of Noosa Council through their Community Grants Program.

The five quarterly award categories are:

1.  Next Gen Athlete Award
2.  Open Athlete Award
3.  Volunteer Award
4.  Official Award
5.  Coaches Award

Acknowledging the diversity of talent in the region, the five quarterly award categories are inclusive of athletes with disability and First Nation athletes.

Nominations are open now until 7th April – winners will be announced on the website and Sunshine Coast Sports social media pages on May 13th.

Sunshine Coast Sports are also on the lookout for judges to join the Sunshine Coast Sports Awards Judging Panel.
