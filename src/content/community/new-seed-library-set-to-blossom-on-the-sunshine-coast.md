Looking for some encourage-mint to get into gardening? Sunshine Coast Libraries new Seed Library is blossoming with a sustainable community collection now available at Kawana and Maleny Libraries.

New and existing library members can plant, grow, and harvest their crops and then have the option to return seeds from that plant, or donate seeds of a different variety back to the library.

The Seed Library collections offer seeds for members of the community to swap in a sustainable manner. Seeds are from local and heirloom fruit and vegetable varieties that might otherwise be lost, as well as new local varieties including flowers.

Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said the Seed Library collection would allow the community to swap, grow and work towards seed sustainability.

“The two unique seed collections will call on each local community to collect and share seeds from the hinterland and coastal regions,” Cr Johnston said.

“The Seed Library provides a wonderful opportunity for everyone from young and old to new and experienced green thumbs to learn new skills and fall in love with gardening.

“Library members will have the opportunity to collect and donate seeds over the next six months as part of the free Seed Library program.

“Beyond providing an opportunity to sustainably grow your own edible garden, the Seed Library promotes connection to community and the natural environment.”
