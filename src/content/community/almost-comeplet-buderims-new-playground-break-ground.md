The final stage of the community’s green pulse is just a month away from being completed by Sunshine Coast Council.

Drone footage over Buderim Village Park has snapped progress shots of the district-level recreation park’s new playground.

Stage 9 of this outstanding project started in July 2022, and will include a new playground with a shade sail, new shelter, park furniture, new pathways and landscaping works.

The playground will feature a rainforest themed tower which is 6.5-metres-high and overlooks the play area. The tower features multiple slides, hammocks, sensory play and climbing elements.

Other features include swings, seesaw, sand play, tipi carousel, lorikeet springer, log climber and tunnel, which provide a variety of play experiences including climbing, swinging, rocking and hanging.

The Shade sails will be installed the first week of December.

This project is proudly funded by the Queensland Government’s South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program in association with Sunshine Coast Council and the Buderim Garden Club. 

The works started in July and are expected to be completed before the Buderim Christmas Carols event in early December 2022. Weather and site conditions permitting.
