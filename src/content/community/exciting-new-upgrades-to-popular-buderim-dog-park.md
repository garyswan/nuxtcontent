Our four-legged friends will soon have more space to run and be able to put their best paw forward thanks to a Sunshine Coast Council upgrade to the fenced Buderim Dog Park starting this month.

Service Excellence Portfolio and Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said the upgrade would improve park conditions for the community and their pets.

“The Buderim Dog Park is a very popular place for our local residents," Cr Dickson said.

Buderim Dog park is set for an upgrade

“The upgrade will involve improving drainage so there will be less muddy puddles when it rains and new grass for dogs to play on.

“The project will be carried out over two stages to keep part of the dog park open at all times.

“Stage one is due to be completed in late-September, and stage two by mid-December, weather permitting.

The dog park works will be done in stages to keep part of the park open at all times.

“I thank you for your patience while council undertakes this work, which will continue to improve on this fantastic community space.”
