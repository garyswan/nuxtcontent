Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Partnership Funding Program is set to continue helping local community organisations achieving great things across the region.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the program strengthened our connection between council and the community.

“It acknowledges the valuable contribution that volunteers are making, working in community organisations to meet the needs and deliver benefit to our communities,” Cr Law said

“The current program, which started last financial year (2021/22) is assisting 136 organisations from community centres to sport clubs and show societies.

“This financial year, council welcomes another five community organisations to the program.

“The newest round of funding will support 109 volunteers who undertake 195 hours of operation per week, adding to the existing partnerships where funding supports more than 12,400 volunteers and almost 7000 hours of operation per week.

“The program, which was established in 2010, aids to build a stronger community together, as part of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

“It helps to provide well established, not-for-profit community organisations certainty by granting funding to contribute to operational expenses, which can be the most difficult type of funding to secure externally.”

The five new groups funded in this round are:

*   Arts Connect Inc – an organisation connecting arts groups and artists
*   Millwell Road Community Centre Inc – a community facility in Maroochydore supporting a wide range of activities and events
*   Maleny Bowls Club Inc – a hinterland sporting and recreational facility
*   Sunshine Coast BMX – a BMX facility in Yandina
*   Sunshine Coast Screen Collective – a peak industry body fostering the advancement of the screen-based industry in the region.

The 2022 program round included an initial Expression of Interest process to identify potential partners and invite eligible organisations to submit a full application earlier this year.

The program includes five categories, including, Community Development, Community Facilities, Community Safety, Cultural Heritage and Economic Development.

Visit council’s website for more information on grants available.

The next round of Minor Grants opens in September and supports community organisations to deliver one-off projects, events and activities that align with council’s strategic priorities and demonstrate a community purpose.
