As more and more people choose to call the Sunshine Coast home, it’s important that we understand what our community values most about their neighbourhoods and the places they regularly visit. 

[Placemaking](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Planning-for-growth/Planning-for-Places)
&#x20;helps identify what makes our neighbourhoods special and distinct from other places within our region, as well as providing new ways to improve those spaces.

Knowing this information now will help us better design a possible future mass transit network, including stations and spaces in and around the coastal corridor.

A range of public transport options is being considered in the [draft Mass Transit Options Analysis report](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Sunshine-Coast-Mass-Transit-Project/Have-Your-Say)
, and you can also [share your thoughts](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/sunshine-coast-mass-transit-how-will-you-make-your-way/survey_tools/mass-transit-survey)
&#x20;about what gives the neighbourhoods along the coastal corridor their distinct character.

With the possibility of more people travelling along a dedicated transport route we want to know your ideas on where we could enhance public spaces and streets for the benefit of our community.

This could mean simple and effective placemaking opportunities such as:

*   more public spaces that are green and shady, activated and vibrant, accessible and inclusive and reflect local our character
*   enhanced connection to open space and recreation making it easier to be healthy and active
*   better connected footpaths that maintain and improve walk-up access to our beaches, shops and services
*   streets that are friendly, shady, comfortable and designed to be welcoming for pedestrians and improving business opportunity  
*   design that acknowledges a place’s character.

Deputy Mayor and Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said that an effective public transport network can be delivered in a way that provides a great opportunity to refresh and enhance the liveability and character of our coastal communities.

“Community feedback received about placemaking possibilities will help us all to design and shape the public spaces in and around the coastal corridor with our local area and Sunshine Coast character top of mind,” Cr Baberowski said.

“A designated transit route can help to create even better community places by enhancing existing spaces, as well as providing new opportunities for more activities and services.

“It need not be just a place for transportation, it can also become a setting for social interaction and a place that better accommodates a greater diversity of people.

“I’m pleased with the interest the community has shown so far, with many people attending the pop-ups to share their ideas.

“I encourage everyone to get involved and to share their thoughts.” “I encourage everyone to get involved and to share their thoughts.”

The outcomes of the community and stakeholder feedback on the mass transit options will inform the finalised Mass Transit Options Analysis report, which will be considered by council later this year.

Subject to council’s agreement, the finalised report will be sent to the State Government for consideration and further assessment as the basis for the next phase of the business case process – the Detailed Business Case.
