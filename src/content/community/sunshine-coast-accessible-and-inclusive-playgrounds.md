### **Our commitment**

Council recognises the importance of accessible and inclusive play spaces, and we are committed to providing inclusive elements for children of all abilities in all our new playgrounds going forward.

Council’s [Recreation Parks Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Sunshine-Coast-Recreation-Parks-Plan)
&#x20;aims to provide a recreation park network that contains fair and equitable provision of park experiences that are accessible to the entire community, regardless of age or ability. This plan recognises the importance of providing safe spaces for all people.

Council is currently working to undertake an audit of all our playgrounds to identify opportunities to expand and enhance inclusive and accessible play experiences across the region.

Council currently has two all-abilities playgrounds in our recreation park network as well as a range of inclusive and accessible play equipment across a number of playgrounds.
