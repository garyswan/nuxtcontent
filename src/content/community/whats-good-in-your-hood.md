The largest social research project in Australian history is underway with the 2021 Australian Liveability Census.

After a year where our local neighbourhoods were more important than ever, it is the perfect time to understand what you value about the Sunshine Coast and what would make it even better.

Sunshine Coast Council encourages everyone to take the 15 minutes to complete this survey and include our community’s perspective in a national forum: [www.placescore.org/dc](http://www.placescore.org/dc)


The findings will capture community values and measure neighbourhood performance across the country and will be used by government of all levels to direct positive change in local areas.
