Sunshine Coast Council is warning residents to be aware of bogus phone calls requesting payment for overdue library books.

Sunshine Coast Libraries has become aware of a small number of isolated incidents where a scammer has called residents asking for payment, over the phone, for overdue library books.

The caller is not authorised by Sunshine Coast Councilâ€™s Libraries, nor is this a process that our libraries would undertake.

Anyone who has received a call of this nature and paid money to the caller is encouraged to contact Policelink on 131 444 so that the matter can be investigated.

If anyone receives a call but recognises it as a scam, the matter can be reported online to [www.scamwatch.gov.au](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/)
.

If you have an overdue library item, please call your nearest Sunshine Coast Council Library branch on (07) 5475 8989.
