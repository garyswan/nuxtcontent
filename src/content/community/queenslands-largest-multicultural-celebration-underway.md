August is Multicultural Queensland Month, an opportunity for everyone to connect, share, listen, learn and acknowledge that, while we may come from different communities and cultures, we all love living in Queensland.

This year is all about acknowledging the role that everyone plays in contributing to Queensland’s culture and prosperity through the theme 'Inclusion in action'.

Inclusive Communities is an outcome area of Sunshine Coast Council’s [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

Council’s objective is for our community to be equitable and inclusive, for the value that all people bring to our community to be recognised, respected and embraced.

It’s also vital that opportunities are available for everyone in our community to participate socially and economically.

Sunshine Coast migrants are encouraged to consider two programs council is implementing.

[The Migrant Work Ready program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Multicultural-Welcome-Hub/Employment-and-business/Migrant-work-ready-program)
&#x20;is FREE for people from a multicultural background. It prepares participants for the local job market and improves prospects to find employment on the Sunshine Coast.

The successful program has run for the past three years and is undertaken via an expression of interest process.  

The program includes eight weeks of employment ready workshops, a graduation event, mentoring and networking opportunities.

Sunshine Coast residents from culturally diverse backgrounds are invited to submit an expression of interest to be considered for a [Migrant Business Ready Scholarship](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Multicultural-Welcome-Hub/Employment-and-business/Migrant-business-ready-scholarship)
.

The scholarship will support eight micro or small businesses to establish and plan for growth.

The scholarship program will be conducted through a specially designed series of workshops as well as opportunities to connect with the Sunshine Coast business community.

Applications for both close midnight Sunday 15 August.

**Did you know Sunshine Coast Council has a dedicated digital [Multicultural Welcome Hub](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Multicultural-Welcome-Hub)
?**

It’s our way of helping new and culturally diverse residents settle and feel welcome in our healthy, smart and creative region.
