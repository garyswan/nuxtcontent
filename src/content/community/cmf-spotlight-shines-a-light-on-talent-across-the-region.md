Selected [Caloundra Music Festival](https://caloundramusicfestival.com/)
&#x20;artists will perform out in the community as part of the new [CMF Spotlight program](https://caloundramusicfestival.com/cmf-spotlight/)
&#x20;rolling out before the three-day music festival opens on September 30.

CMF Spotlight is a new initiative designed to extend the reach of CMF deeper into the Sunshine Coast region in the lead-up to the annual beachside event.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said it was great to see CMF vibes shared across our region thanks to this initiative.

“We’ve also taken a collaborative approach this year with two other major events – [Buskers by the Lake](https://www.buskersbythelake.com.au/)
&#x20;and [*That’s Not My Dog!*](https://www.thatsnotmydogfestival.com.au/)
&#x20;comedy festival,” Cr Landsberg said.

“We are supporting the comedy festival by supplying local talent through the CMF spotlight program and providing the busking festival winners an opportunity to perform on stage at CMF.

“‘Lamkin Lane’ winners from the [“Surge” High School Rock Spectacular](https://beerwahshs.eq.edu.au/extra-curricular/cultural-activities/about-s-u-r-g-e)
&#x20;(August 17) will also perform at CMF this year, thanks to Beerwah State High School in conjunction with Lions Australia and council.”

Buskers by the Lake festival director Cindy Jensen said it was exciting that ‘Battle of the Buskers’ winners would perform at Caloundra Music Festival this year.

“Our over 18 winner, Tanya George from Melbourne, and our under 18 winner, James Desbrow from Caboolture, wowed Battle of the Buskers crowds and judges,” Ms Jensen said.

“They are so grateful for the opportunity.”  

**[Adam James](https://caloundramusicfestival.com/profile/adam-james/)
** will perform at Kings Beach Amphitheatre on Saturday, August 27, with his local talent coming to the stage in addition to national artists Killing Heidi and Tripod playing the comedy festival *That’s Not My Dog!*

Wearing his heart on his sleeve, Adam is steadily growing his audience and reputation in the Australian music scene with hard work and brilliant stage presence.

He’s shared stages with Kim Churchill, Buttermello, Maggie Slater, Matilda Duncan and Voye, just to name a few, and sold-out local shows on the Sunshine Coast within days, as well as playing at Groovin’ The Moos mini festival - Freshly Squeezed.

Rocking a stomp box and guitar live, don’t miss the opportunity to see Adam tell his heartfelt stories raw and live. [Tickets](https://www.thatsnotmydogfestival.com.au/)
