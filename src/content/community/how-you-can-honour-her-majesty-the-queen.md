Sunshine Coast residents are encouraged to pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as the world gives thanks for her life of service.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said many people were looking for a way they could honour The Queen, who the world lost today, aged 96.

The Mayor said messages of condolence and support for The Royal Family on the passing of Her Majesty could be conveyed via [the official State of Queensland Condolence Book](https://www.qld.gov.au/about/events-awards-honours/messages-of-condolence/hermajesty)
.

“Buckingham Palace has indicated that online ‘Messages of Support and Condolence are preferred over the use of physical condolence books”, Mayor Jamieson said.

“The messages of support and condolence provided to the State of Queensland Condolence Book will be collated and forwarded via Government House Queensland to Buckingham Palace’’. 

The Mayor earlier acknowledged the Queen’s lifetime of dedication to duty and service to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.

“Many of us will remember with great fondness her visit to the Sunshine Coast in 2002 to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting,’’ he said.

“Her Majesty embodied and exemplified the principles of public service, compassion and care for everyone she met and her enduring sense of purpose in promoting goodwill, respect and tolerance.

“At this sad time and significant point in history, we extend our deepest condolences to His Majesty the King and the Royal Family and give thanks for the life and service of Queen Elizabeth II.’’
