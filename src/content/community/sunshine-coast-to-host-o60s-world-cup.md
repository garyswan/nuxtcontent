After little more than a decade of growth from regional foundations to interstate then international competition, Veterans Cricket Australia will host the inaugural O60s Cricket World Cup on the Sunshine Coast this spring.

Delayed for 2 years after Covid-19 restrictions, the tournament will run from 2-15 September 2022. Twelve teams have entered, with England the only absence from the major cricket nations, though the Rest of the World representatives will have an English flavour.

Three coast venues are to host matches, which start on Saturday, 3rd of September, following the official opening at the Alexandra Headlands Surf Club the previous afternoon. Maroochydore, Caloundra and Yandina venues will provide our visitors with a range of Coast experiences, leading to the Grand Final at Maroochydore’s John Blanck Oval on the 14th of September, with the presentation and closing ceremonies the following day.

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said hosting the first ever Over 60s Cricket World Cup was an exciting announcement for the Sunshine Coast region.

“It’s the continuation of the tradition of the Sunshine Coast hosting many Veterans Cricket Events & Championships in past years.”

“And it’s great to see the Tournament Program includes a number of social events at the Alex Surf Club, with NightQuarter \[in Birtinya] hosting the Final Lunch & Awards Presentations.”

“The event is expected to attract eight international teams, so this is a great investment through Sunshine Coast Council’s Major Events Sponsorship program to showcase the Sunshine Coast as a destination,” Cr Landsberg said.

Important dates:   

*   Saturday, September 3rd -start of play.
*   September 5th, 8th, 10th, 12th – Official Rest Days
*   September 11th – Crossover Semifinals

TEAM POOLS:

POOL A – Australia, Canada, India, Sri Lanka, Wales, Zimbabwe

POOL B­ -New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, USA, West Indies, Rest of the World.
