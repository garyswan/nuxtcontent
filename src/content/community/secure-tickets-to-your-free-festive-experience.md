Multi-coloured lights, roving entertainment, story time and The Grinch are set to excite at this year’s [Festive Garden](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/17029062-a/the-festive-garden)
.

The free event, now in its second year at the Maroochy Botanic Gardens, will be held 5-9pm from December 16-20 and with more lights and more entertainment, the festive celebration is going to be brighter than ever.

Tickets and information for the free event are now available at <https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/thefestivegarden>
&#x20;Bookings are essential.

Sunshine Coast Council community portfolio Councillor David Law said that last year the event was a huge success.

“This year, we’re expecting the experience to be better than ever and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit,” Cr Law said.

“We’ll have a diverse range of food trucks and a free park and ride service to and from the event included with your ticket.”

Sunshine Coast Council Events Team Leader Kerrie Alterator said this year’s experience would showcase the beauty of the Maroochy Bushland Botanic Garden.

“To create that really magical experience, we’ve shifted the lighting focus up and into the trees plus we’ll have more entertainment,” Ms Alterator said.

“Children can write their letter to Santa, take place in scavenger hunt activities or settle in for a reading of ‘The night before Christmas’.

“There will be a Christmas Grinch Show, with two performances each night and The Sunshine Statesman Barbershop Chorus were such a hit last year, they’re back again.

“Santa will be walking around the gardens, ready to snap a selfie and chat to visitors.”

Buses will run continuously between the UniSC Transit Centre and the Botanic Garden from 5pm, with the last bus returning at 9pm each evening.

Buses are able to accommodate wheelchairs, strollers, and mobility devices, however those who are unable to catch a bus can contact our events team to make alternative arrangements. Submit Festive Garden enquiries to the events team at events\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au
