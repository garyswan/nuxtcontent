An initiative to help men with incontinence is being rolled out across the Sunshine Coast.

In collaboration with the Continence Foundation*,* Sunshine Coast Council has installed 102 male incontinence product disposal bins at public amenities locations across the region.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said the initiative was a welcome step towards ensuring our public facilities accommodated and provided adequate services for everyone.

“The Continence Foundation Bins4Blokes campaign is an Australia-wide awareness and advocacy campaign promoting the installation of incontinence product disposal bins in male public toilet facilities,” Cr Johnston said.

“There are many men who ride bikes, run and walk along our coastal pathway who may need assistance.

“Across the region, all public amenities have sanitary hygiene bin services.

“However these are not suitable for male incontinence pads and a specific bin type and additional service was required.

“We acknowledge the work of the Continence Foundation for bringing the BINS4Blokes campaign to our attention so that we can ensure we can provide these bins at all public amenity locations across the region in the future.”

To find out which public amenities are serviced by this new initiative, check out [The National Public Toilet Map](https://toiletmap.gov.au/)
&#x20;which is funded by the [Australian Government Department of Health](https://health.gov.au/)
 as part of the [National Continence Program](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/national-continence-program-ncp)
 and is managed through the [Continence Foundation of Australia](https://continence.org.au/)
. 

This provides a mapping tool to identify the location of our public amenities, the services available, and times of opening.
