As the journey commences towards the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a new vision and identity for Sunshine Coast Sports was revealed. Formerly known as the Sunshine Coast Sports Federation, the organisation was founded in 1968 and has proudly served the region’s sports community for 53 years. 

With a vision to be a respected, independent, community sport minded, regional body that champions and supports grass roots sports in the Sunshine Coast region and Noosa shire, Sunshine Coast Sports’ five-year strategic plan articulates a roadmap that includes the following key targets for achievement by 2025:

Successfully rebrand to Sunshine Coast Sports – celebrating and recognising the organisation's fifty-year history whilst developing a youthful, modern brand to reposition their role and purpose as well as to engage and inspire a new generation of supporters and athletes.

To establish a new governance model and charter for Sunshine Coast Sports that will inspire and attract sustained partnerships with regional sport internal stakeholders and external stakeholders including government, corporate, community and philanthropic sector.

Activate a strategic partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation to substantially enhance the fundraising focus of Sunshine Coast Sports to achieve $1m in combined 5-year revenue for regional sport.

Continue the legacy of the Sunshine Coast Sports Awards, relaunching the Awards with a focus on amateur grass roots sports achievements and digital platform delivery to increase reach and engagement across the region.

Also today, Sunshine Coast Sports was excited to announce that Sunshine Coast Council had committed to supporting our strategic plan, committing vital funds through the ‘Train Sunshine Coast’ initiative.

‘Train Sunshine Coast’ received $1.3 million from the Australian and Queensland Governments through the jointly funded Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements Local Economic Recovery Program, established following the 2019 bushfires. An additional $256,000 was also contributed by the Sunshine Coast Council. This is in addition to the recent confirmation that Council will provide three-year support to Sunshine Coast Sports through its Community Partnerships Program. 

Acting Chair of Sunshine Coast Sports, Aaron Flanagan, said that support from all three tiers of government of our new direction is incredibly important as we reignite the organisation after a challenging pandemic period. 

“Community sport has really suffered through the pandemic and we are passionately committed to unlocking the potential of sport for our region.  Sport matters.  It is a vitally important aspect of our social fabric and research shows that the return on investment from sport is $7 for every dollar invested. 

Leveraging Federal Government tax deductibility through the DGR status of the Government’s Australian Sports Foundation, it is our goal to raise $1m over five years and we are super excited to be relaunching the Sunshine Coast Sports Awards in January 2022.”

Member for Fairfax and Special Envoy for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games Ted O’Brien said Sunshine Coast Sports has an important role play in the lead up to 2032.

“Elite athletes might be the ones showcased at Olympic and Paralympic Games, but there’s nothing more important than community sport played at the grassroots level.

“Local sporting initiatives such as Sunshine Coast Sports are important pieces of the puzzle in our early preparations to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.” Mr O’Brien said.

“The real opportunity of hosting the 2032 Games lies not in the glitz and glamour of a major event, but in the building of lasting legacies including developing the capacity and the quality of local grassroots sport.

“This Australian Government funding and the partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation is yet another vote of confidence in the strength of our region and its future potential”.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the newly rebranded Sunshine Coast Sports would add a fresh perspective, a community-oriented voice that champions and supports the development of grass roots sports and participation opportunities on the Sunshine Coast.

“On behalf of our Sunshine Coast Council, I am delighted that we are able to support Sport Sunshine Coast reposition itself and implement a fresh strategic plan and priorities to guide its activities,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Having a clear plan for what it is seeking to achieve for our community is what encouraged Council to commit funding towards this revitalised organisation.

“Sunshine Coast Council is providing support through the Train Sunshine Coast initiative which, in turn, is supported by the Queensland Bushfires Economic Recovery Program.

“In addition to this funding, council is providing three-years’ support to Sunshine Coast Sports through its Community Partnerships Program.”

“Our Council considers this investment an important building block in developing capacity, participation opportunities and to encouraging more active, healthy lifestyles across our community.”
