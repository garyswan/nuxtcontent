The life of a local legend, Howard Walker, has been recognised with Peachester Park renamed in his honour.

At the request of residents, the renamed Howard Walker Memorial Park Jinibara Country acknowledges Mr Walker’s extraordinary contribution to the Peachester community.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said remarkable community members such as Mr Walker selflessly helped to create the distinct character and open charm of our country towns.

“The Howard Walkers of the world give our country towns the ‘‘g’day, village feel’ we love,” Cr Baberowski said.

“By recognising the contribution made by such special people, and by the first Australians, we elevate the importance of our shared history and are better able to retain a sense of community through the connection to this special park.”

Kevin Wrayford from the Peachester Rural Fire Brigade said Mr Walker became the unofficial ‘Face of Peachester’.

“Howard Walker lived his entire life in Peachester,” Mr Wrayford said.

“He was born here, went to school here, worked at the local sawmill and worked the family farm as a dairy farmer.

“He was a hall trustee for more than 55 years, a foundation member of the Peachester Bush Fire Brigade, History Committee and the Peachester tennis and cricket clubs.

“Howard married and raised his family in a cottage immediately across the road from the park and, in his retirement, lived about 70 metres to the west of the park.

“All newcomers to town – whether a tourist, visitor or resident – would usually stop at the local store, the hall or the school.

“Howard would be found at any of those places to welcome newcomers, helping them with everything they needed to know.

“He was usually the first person any new people would meet.

“Over the past few years, since his passing, we have spoken with a range of community people – some older, some newer – and the general consensus was that it would be a wonderful opportunity and a very fitting location to commemorate an entire lifetime of effort from one man who contributed so much to the atmosphere of our town.”

Sunshine Coast Council received the renaming proposal for Peachester Park from a member of the community.

The application was assessed by a Naming Panel who supported renaming the community space to The Howard Walker Memorial Park Jinibara Country.

The new park signage has now been installed on the corner of Peachester Road and High Street.
