Sunshine Coast Council’s latest Major Grant recipients are busy planning their next projects, with 84 local community organisations receiving a share of $593,562 to deliver great community projects thanks to the last round of funding.

Increasing local participation and accessibility to the arts is one great outcome of this round of council funding, with a hearing loop set for installation at Lind Lane Theatre; event costs support for the 2023 Sunshine Coast Chamber Music Festival; and a $30,000 injection for Coolum HeARTs to expand their accessible arts facility.

From sporting clubs to cultural heritage groups and chambers of commerce, many diverse and dedicated not-for-profit groups will be supported by council’s Community Grants Program to help the Sunshine Coast community thrive. 

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said these grants assisted volunteers to deliver one-off projects, events and activities that provided broad community benefit.

“Community organisations are huge contributors to the Sunshine Coast and make it a wonderful place to live.

“This round of community grants supports new equipment purchases, infrastructure projects and local and regional events which build a stronger community and reflect the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019 – 2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
,” Cr Law said.  

“Coolum HeARTs Inc will receive $30,000 to expand their current shed. They offer low-cost access to the arts for everyone in the community.”

Coolum HeARTs Treasurer Vivien Collins said the organisation was thankful to council for being granted funds to help complete the necessary work.

“Our mission is building community through arts and we do this by providing affordable access to music and the arts to all in the community, especially those with significant challenges, as well as offering a safe and calm place for social connection in order to improve health and wellbeing,” Ms Collins said.

“The $30,000 council grant will enable us to extend our current shed and help create a dedicated administration area and provide space for extra storage units for art supplies and musical instruments.

“We are also extremely grateful to the Coolum businesses and local community for their on-going support.”

Grant applications were received in six categories: Community Development, Community Facilities, Creative Development, Cultural Heritage, Economic Development, and Sport and Recreation.

Other recipient organisations include:

*   Sunshine Coast Chamber Music Festival Ltd - $15,000 towards the 2023 Sunshine Coast Chamber Music Festival
*   Nambour & District Historical Museum Association Inc - $7,500 for a mural to preserve the memory of the former lift span tramway bridge across the Maroochy River
*   University of the Sunshine Coast Athletics Club - $6,242 to purchase 30 hurdles.
