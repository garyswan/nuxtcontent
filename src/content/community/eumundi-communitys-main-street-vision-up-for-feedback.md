Home to artisan treasures, rich heritage, creative arts and markets, Eumundi’s village feel has been enhanced in a new streetscape design for Memorial Drive.

Since November 2020, Sunshine Coast Council has been carefully listening to, and speaking with, Eumundi locals, businesses and community groups to find out their vision and values for the future of their main street.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said the valuable feedback had been collated to develop the draft streetscape design which was now ready for further feedback.

“We want to continue to preserve and celebrate the heritage, character and community vision for the much-loved Memorial Drive well into the future,” Cr Law said.

“From today (March 14) to Monday 11 April, we are asking the community, ‘Have we got it right?’ in translating your values and vision into the draft streetscape design.

“This important next step is critical to shaping and protecting what the community loves about this hinterland village.”

Late last year, council sought further feedback from the local business community through business surveys and community workshops to develop the Draft Streetscape Concept Design.

The initial and follow up feedback informed the Design and Placemaking team of the community’s priorities which included a desire for an improved pedestrian experience, artistic lighting features and enhancement of memorial fig trees.

There was also strong support for pedestrian linkages from Memorial Drive to Napier Road to improve access to existing car-parking areas.

Stage 1 Community consultation.

Cr Law said he was grateful for the community’s patience during consultation pauses due to COVID-19, and emphasised the safety of our community was a priority.

“By rescheduling community consultation, we now have a better understanding of the business needs relating to the Memorial Drive streetscape project including on-street parking and footpath dining,” Cr Law said.

“We also know the community would like to create a cool, shady and green street, revitalise surfaces and spaces, make parking easier and provide places to sit and socialise.

“I look forward to your final feedback on the concept design.”

Visit council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/eumundi-placemaking)
  to complete the survey online before Monday, April 11, 2022.

Following community feedback, the final designs will be produced, and the actual construction is scheduled to take place in the 2022/23 financial year. Council will keep the community updated as the project progresses.

The $1.77 million Eumundi Streetscape Placemaking design and construction project has been funded by council, with $500,000 contributed by the Queensland Government’s COVID Works for Queensland program.
