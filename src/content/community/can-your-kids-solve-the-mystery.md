Sunshine Coast youngsters are invited to become a Junior Ranger Detective and go undercover to solve the mystery at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve's Operation Botanica exhibit.

Some of the plants in the rainforest are under threat and others are strangling each other so visitors need to follow the clues to solve the botanica mystery.

Along the way they’ll meet a cast of botanical characters – the good guys, the villains, the stranglers, the victims – and learn about the amazing plants that fight for survival in the tough rainforest environment.

Sunshine Coast Council Environmental Education Officer Dr Lisa Ryan said Operation Botanica told the story of a significant, but fragmented, patch of rainforest.

“We want to inspire amazement at the many ways rainforest plants have adapted to survive the unique conditions of the rainforest," Dr Ryan said.

"This includes low light and high rainfall and humidity and raise awareness about some of the key threats our rainforest plant species are facing.

“One of these little-known threats is myrtle-rust, a fungal pathogen that is invading Australia’s forests and attacking members of the myrtaceae family ( such as gum trees, lilly pillies, tea trees and bottlebrushes).

“Indeed two of our rainforest species are critically endangered due to this threat.

Dr Ryan said these stories lend themselves perfectly to an overarching narrative of a murder mystery in the rainforest, allowing us to tell the individual stories of the victims, the suspects, the detectives and the cast of other botanical characters all fighting for survival.

“We hope visitors enjoy the experience as much as they would a good detective thriller and maybe their visit will be all the more memorable for it.”

This exhibit is on display until April 2021. Head to council’s [what’s on calendar](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Events/Whats-On/3822)
