Sunshine Coast Council Libraries are calling on the community to help share the gift of reading with local kids this Christmas.

From Monday, November 15 until Monday, December 13 Libraries will be accepting new book donations, which will be distributed to families in need by local charities in time for Christmas. 

The community is encouraged to donate new children’s or young adult fiction and non-fiction books to their local Sunshine Coast library branch.

Being surrounded by lots and lots of books where they live helps children build vocabulary, increase awareness and comprehension, and expand horizons — all benefiting them in adulthood, according to findings published in the Social Science Research journal.

Sunshine Coast Libraries are committed to making literacy and recreational reading opportunities available to everyone in our community through their annual Books4Kids Christmas appeal.

Get involved to help Sunshine Coast Libraries ensure all homes across the region have access to their own books, by supporting the 2021 Books4Kids appeal.
