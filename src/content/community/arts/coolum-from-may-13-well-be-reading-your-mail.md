Jack Hagan will be reading Coolum residents’ and visitors’ mail in Tickle Park every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 4pm from May 13 until June 3. Why? He’s the next Coolum Keeper!

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said in true Coolum fashion, the community had embraced the project and the previous six Keepers.

“This Keeper Project is such an innovative way to capture the stories and essence of Coolum in a fun and interactive way,” Cr Suarez said.

“I encourage everyone who lives, works and plays in the area to contribute and be part of the story.”

Sunshine Coast Council’s Creative Development Team Leader Megan Rowland said the Keepers worked in a temporary role as observer, collector, maker and storyteller within the community.

“There will be 10 Keepers – Jack is number seven – who are all Coolum-based artists and creatives representing a diverse range of practices,” Ms Rowland said.

“What’s different about a live public art project is the outcome or the result is not determined at the beginning of the process, rather it is informed by the people and place as it unfolds.

“As each Keeper takes the baton, we encourage residents and visitors to be part of the process and engage with the project.”

During Jack’s three-week term, there will be five interactive mailboxes, endless opportunities and countless messages to be shared.

Jack invites the Coolum community to connect with their neighbourhood through anonymous mail.

“I’m looking forward to being a messenger and invite everyone to get involved,” Mr Hagan said.

“Who knows what could happen and what we might reveal. Let’s have some fun with this, Coolum.”

The next three Keepers are yet to be announced but will complete their training assignments with Field Theory at the Coolum Community Centre May 14 and 15.

&#x20;The Keeper project is delivered by Sunshine Coast Council’s ArtsCoast in partnership with Red Chair and developed in collaboration with [Field Theory](http://fieldtheory.com.au/)
.

This project is supported by the Queensland Government through Arts Queensland and The Regional Arts Development Fund, a partnership funding program with Sunshine Coast Council which supports local arts and culture in the region.
