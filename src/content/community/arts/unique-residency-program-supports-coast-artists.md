A cutting-edge program helping support, develop and grow the region’s arts sector is looking for its next cohort of artists.

[Project 24](https://www.2ndspacesc.com/project-24)
&#x20;is an artist residency program which hosts two artists every month for 12 months at [2ndSpace](https://www.2ndspacesc.com/)
&#x20;studio in Nambour, supporting established and emerging artists to create, develop and show their work.

Sunshine Coast Council Creative Development Team Leader Megan Rowland said artists and collectives of all disciplines should apply—choreographers, projection artists, dancers and visual creatives, plus everyone else in between.

“Each month, the two chosen artists or collectives take over our MakersSpace and Studio 3 at 2nd Space in Nambour,” Ms Rowland said.

“We provide the space, access to industry mentors and peers along with a bursary of $2000, which allows artists to unpack an existing idea or experiment with something new.

“Opportunities like this are vital to the growth of the creative sector and in turn the cultural landscape of our region.

“If we want to enjoy the arts here, we need to support them at the concept stage.”

#### Expressions of interest are open until April 10, with successful applicants announced April 20.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Cr Rick Baberowski said a key goal of the Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018 – 2038 and ArtsCoast, was to help build and develop the profile and recognition of Sunshine Coast artists.

“We have a sizable number of talented artists and creative practitioners on the Sunshine Coast, and through support, encourage them to stay as well as to attract more,” Cr Baberowski said.

“To do that, we need to help generate opportunities for them to create, develop and showcase their work.

“Through Project 24, artists have access to a collaborative, supportive, creative environment where ideas are exchanged and inspiration can flourish.

“Plus, they receive the critical exposure and the opportunity to present their work to the public during the showings, held at the end of each residency. 

“From the film projection and inflatable art projects we’ve seen presented so far, through to dance and photography works, I always look forward to seeing what fresh ideas the next Project 24 cohort of artists will produce”

Project 24 is delivered by Sunshine Coast Council through ArtsCoast.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said for some time, Nambour had been gaining a reputation as the artistic heart of the region.

“We’ve got unique public art, fresh large-scale murals and works by cutting edge artists, an art sound trail and unique spaces to experience art such as The Old Ambo and 2nd Space.
