An award-winning filmmaker and a best-selling author from the Sunshine Coast have signed a deal with Entertainment giant Foxtel for a new cooking show that highlights the region’s stunning locations and sort-after produce.

The Easiest Cooking Show Ever is the creation of Caloundra home-cooking author Kim McCosker and co-producer and Sunny Coast Showdown winner Sam Robinson with the six-episode series premiering in February.

Mr Robinson said it was Mrs McCosker’s passion for the region and its people that convinced him to be part of the project.

“Kim was the driving force behind the show. Her attitude was ‘build it and they will come’,” he said.

“It was her love of the Sunshine Coast and the success of her 4 Ingredients cookbooks that really inspired me,” he said.

Mrs McCosker said the show makes every effort to showcase the area’s best assets.

“We got some amazing help from the local Food and Agri Network members and championed the amazing local locations we all love – Yandina Markets, the beautiful Bulcock Beach, the Glass House Mountains to name just a few,” Mrs McCosker said.

Mrs McCosker has sold more than nine million cookbooks around the world. She said the show was made on the back of that success.

“We went to our \[social media] platforms and asked readers what would you like us to cook. That’s how we chose the recipes we included in the six episodes.”

Mr Robinson, who last year won the major award at the Sunny Coast Showdown film incubator and festival, was overwhelmed when Foxtel contacted his video production company, Wild Bunch Media, looking for content.

“They had heard about the success I had with the Showdown and said, ‘can you put us in touch with your CFO’,” he said.

“We’re only a growing production company and I had to suddenly put on that new hat.”

Mr Robinson believes winning the Showdown was integral to Foxtel finding out about The Easiest Cooking Show Ever.

“The fact that my other show, The Recipe Collector, was in the Showdown and was picked up by Matchbox Pictures gave us a bit of kudos,” he said.

“And what I learned through the mentorship of the Showdown was invaluable when talking to Foxtel.”

Mr Robinson said Foxtel has indicated interest in a second season of the Easiest Cooking Show Ever and he is on the hunt for supporters and investors.

The Showdown brings opportunities for the Sunshine Coast on all levels from supporting tourism, food and agriculture businesses to advancing the local screen industry.

&#x20;launches this Friday, 16 December at Column Surf Club and is proudly supported by the Sunshine Coast Council.
