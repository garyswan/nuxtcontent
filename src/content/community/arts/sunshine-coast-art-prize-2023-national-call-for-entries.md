The 2023 winner of the [Sunshine Coast Art Prize](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/art-prizes/sunshine-coast-art-prize)
&#x20;will take home $25,000 and joins ‘greats’ like Tony Albert, Peter Hudson, Raquel Ormella, Michael Cook, Diena Georgetti and Natalya Hughes in the Sunshine Coast Art Collection.

With that trajectory available, it’s no wonder the winner’s title has become one of the most hotly contested among Australian artists.

The visual art award is now in its 18th year and is a showcase for outstanding contemporary 2D arts practice in Australia, offering a total prize pool of more than $40,000.

There are four prize categories, including three professionally judged categories as well as the popular people’s choice award.

Submissions can be made online at [gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/Entry)
&#x20;with entries closing 11:59PM, May 14, 2023.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowksi said the acquisitive prize was open to Australian contemporary artists working in any 2D medium including new media. 

“I’m pleased we have a significant $25,000 prize, which is important to attract the best talent and help support the arts communities, however almost more exciting for us is to add top level art into our Sunshine Coast Art Collection,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Our collection is growing rapidly and now has more than 1,000 works and most importantly the depth of subjects, styles and mediums is getting better all the time. We also have an ambitious collecting strategy and are grateful to our generous donors, philanthropists, who ensure our collection is moving towards the cutting edge of contemporary art practice. 

“In addition, all 40 artworks selected as finalists will be exhibited in the Sunshine Coast Art Prize exhibition from August 18 to October 15 at the Caloundra Regional Gallery.

“The exhibition very deliberately coincides with our 10-day multi-arts [Horizon Festival](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/)
, providing another outstanding outlet for the many cultural consumers the festival draws to the region.

“I always find it fascinating to see what artists have to say about our times and look forward to seeing how this year’s artists present their works and encourage all artists to enter.”

### Art prize categories and sponsors include:

*   an acquisitive major prize of $25,000 cash sponsored by Argon Law and Sunshine Coast Council
*   a non-acquisitive Highly Commended prize of $5000 sponsored by the De Deyne family
*   a non-acquisitive People’s Choice prize of $2500 sponsored by Caloundra Chamber of Commerce
*   a Sunshine Coast Art Prize Residency sponsored by Caloundra Regional Gallery and Montville Country Cabins.
