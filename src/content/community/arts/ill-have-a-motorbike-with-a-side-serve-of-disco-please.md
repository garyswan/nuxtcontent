Sunshine Coast roads have become a gallery for finalist works in the Sunshine Coast Art Prize – a regional prize with a national reputation.

Thanks to a partnership between Coastline BMW and Sunshine Coast Council, drivers could be rolling up to the lights behind a BMW G 310 R motorbike wrapped in Franky Howell’s stunning *[Colour like a disco thang](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2021-Finalists/Franky-Howell)
* or a BMW 3 Series art car wrapped in Agnes Kohler’s *[Mirraa Kamarra](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2021-Finalists/Agnes-Kohler)
.*

The art car and bike pay homage to the iconic BMW Art Car project, a long-running art series introduced in 1975 by French race car driver and auctioneer Hervé Poulain.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the art car/motorbike initiative was a creative side step to take art out of the gallery and onto the streets in an unusual and exciting way.

“As wonderful forms of pattern, the chosen art works lend themselves perfectly to being applied as a new and intriguing skin to the vehicles and should certainly attract more attention and start some conversations as people see them in the streets,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The Sunshine Coast Art Prize is our region’s flagship art prize and the eye-catching vehicles help grab more awareness for this excellent exhibition of contemporary Australia artwork.

“While the winner of the Prize is still to be announced, the People’s Choice voting is open until 19 September and can be completed [online](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2021-Finalists/Franky-Howell)
, with winners in all categories to be revealed on September 23.”

Coastline BMW dealer principal Brad Butcher said Coastline BMW had been an active part of the Sunshine Coast Arts Community for more than 25 years, continuing BMW’s passion for the arts.

“The Art Car initiative was first introduced through BMW and is a proud tradition that Coastline BMW upholds; the cars are a captivating symbol of the Sunshine Coast Art Prize and a striking addition to the streets of the Sunshine Coast. We look forward to continuing the partnership in future years.” Mr Butcher said.

Caloundra Regional Gallery Manager and Curator Jo Duke said council teamed up with Coastline BMW to select finalist artworks that would work as a prestige vehicle wrap in a dynamic context.

“We are delighted with the result – the works by Agnes Kohler and Franky Howell use colour and pattern to bring an incredible vibrancy and energy to the BMWs both while on the move or sitting pretty parked on the street”. Ms Duke said.

Franky Howell is a Victorian 2D artist and said that *[Colour like a disco thang](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2021-Finalists/Franky-Howell)
* was the latest in an ongoing series of works.

“These latest large Flashe paintings continue my interest in a three-dimensional play with flat, hard-edged abstract forms,” Mr Howell said.

“I am interested in both an intuitive and analytical approach to creating forms that become distorted in the process, creating complex and confusing spaces. Painted with graphic flatness, saturated colour and distorted planes, these works give the viewer a heightened sense of contradiction and confusion.”

Agnes Kohler said of her *Mirraa Kamarra* artwork, there were different coloured rocks that can be found on Bentinck Island. In her Kayardild language they call them mirraa (pretty) kamarra (rocks).

The Sunshine Coast Art Prize is  a Sunshine Coast Council initiative and issponsored by major funding partner Argon Law Sunshine Coast long-time supporters and sponsors - the De Deyne family,Caloundra Chamber of Commerce, Coastline BMW, Montville Country Cabins and International Art Services (IAS), and is presented in partnership with Council’s Horizon Festival.

The Sunshine Coast Art Prize Exhibition is on show until 10 October at Caloundra Regional Gallery, 22 Omrah Avenue and online at [gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/2021-Finalists/Agnes-Kohler)
&#x20;
