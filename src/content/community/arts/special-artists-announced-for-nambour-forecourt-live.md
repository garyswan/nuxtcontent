Nambour Forecourt Live! will return this Friday, September 16, for another evening of good vibes with friends and family gathering to enjoy live music and food in this community space.

Caloundra Music Festival (CMF) emerging artist Darcy Kate will take to the Forecourt Live! stage as part of the CMF Spotlight program, supporting Nyssa Ray, Boi and Eskae and Minnie Marks.

Sunshine Coast Libraries will be running Storytime from 3.30pm and family games at 4pm.

Creative workshops will be held from 4-6pm and there will be free face painting, donut decorating, kids’ activities and a coconut weaving workshop.

Local brewers Sunshine and Sons and Morts Brewing are hosting stalls with a licensed bar run by the Nambour Tram Co.

A pizza food truck and Saltwater Eco Tours will be providing tasty treats, with takeaway dinner offerings available from restaurants along Currie Street for the evening.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Nambour Forecourt Live! had gone from strength to strength.

“After a few months off through winter, it’s great to see the monthly Nambour Forecourt Live! event return for spring and summer,” Cr Law said.

“It’s a great time for us all to get together to welcome spring, enjoy good food, music and fun.”

“This month the focus for the event will be on spotlighting the upcoming Caloundra Music Festival and the local talent our region has to offer.”

Nambour Forecourt Live! is jointly presented by Sunshine Coast Council and Peace Run Records and aims to support local businesses and artists.

Bring the whole family down to Nambour Forecourt Live! for a fun community event from 3.30- 8.30pm.

Bring your own water bottle and picnic rug or chair and, if there's passing showers, an umbrella.

Last year’s Nambour Forecourt upgrade was part of the Nambour Activation Plan.
