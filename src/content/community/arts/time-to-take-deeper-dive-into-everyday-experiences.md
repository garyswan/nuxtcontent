Inspired by a three-hour public transport commute, the latest exhibition at [Caloundra Regional Gallery](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/about/caloundra-regional-gallery)
&#x20;offers a unique sensory journey through time and space.

Titled *THIS IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT YOU,* Ruby Donohoe’s experiential installation blends video, sculpture, sound and text, inviting audiences to consider the state of the passenger in transit and is on show until June 25.

Gallery Curator Jo Duke said the exhibition pushed the boundaries and encouraged audiences to take a deeper dive into their everyday experiences.

“The experience really is quite unique — what Ruby does beautifully is capture a journey, bringing in glimpses of light and sound that represent our movement from one space to another,” Ms Duke said.

*“THIS IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT YOU* draws parallels between the poetics of transit and the body as a vehicle in which the ‘self’ is merely a passenger.

“During that experience we’re invited to explore our mental and physical connection during transit and whether we really can be in two places at once.”

Throughout the exhibition, Ruby delivered a series of sell-out [one-on-one participatory performances](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsFmz9_vhZi/)
. These questioned the mechanics of relationships with a playful, quietly subversive stumble in the potential utopia.

Also on show at the gallery is *[A Wearable Canvas](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/a-wearable-canvas)
*, featuring a collection of works, usually only seen on a catwalk, from the [Australian Wearable Art Festival.](https://australianwearableart.com.au/)


The exhibition offers a unique opportunity to see how these spectacular works were created—paper, cable ties and bicycle tyres being just some of the materials artists and designers have brought to life in this fusion of high-end fashion and sculptural art forms.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said putting these contrasting exhibitions side by side helps to demonstrate the diversity of contemporary art exhibited as part of the public program in our region’s art gallery.

“Ruby’s exhibition gives the boundaries of art shown in a gallery a real shove sideways and challenges us to the think beyond our usual sphere of consideration,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Caloundra Regional Gallery consistently offers these unique choices to engage with works and artists at the edges of contemporary arts practice.

“We already have our excellent Sunshine Coast Art Prize, but when combined with these dynamic curations of the work from local and national artists, the Sunshine Coast positions itself as an impressive regional contender on the national stage of arts and ideas.”

Council’s approach, priorities, programs and investment in the arts is guided by [The Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018 – 2038](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/experience-sunshine-coast/arts-and-culture/arts-plan-policies-and-partnerships/arts-plan)
, developed in collaboration with Sunshine Coast Council and the Sunshine Coast Arts Advisory Board.
