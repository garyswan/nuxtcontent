Explore 'Country Elements' by artist Nikita Newley, created especially for this year's NAIDOC theme, Heal Country.

For Nikita, the purpose of this showcase is to bring to life to the meaning behind the word "healing".

"Being a First Nations woman, my connection to Country comes very naturally and is like second nature to me," Nikita said.

"I believe by listening to our elders and hearing their stories you can gauge the importance of how special it is to stay involved with your culture and heritage.

"For many years we have walked this country and healed with it!

"We have allowed our selfish mainstream ways to get in between that connection and we have not given it the nourishment that we, as humans, need to give ourselves and the earth."

This four-piece series captures all the elements in a contemporary First Nations art style.

"Staying in the present and seeing Fire, Earth, Water and Air all move as one. Taking that time to heal yourself through Country listening and letting it guide you to a special place which only you are capable of accessing."

Visit the display at Maroochydore Library Artspace until Monday 16 August. For more information please visit Council's [website](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/en/Exhibitions/Maroochydore-Artspace/Nikita-Newley)
