If you have ever asked yourself what the future will look like – then now is the time to visit the Sunshine Coast’s Regional Gallery, where *[Dystopia/Utopia: 2070](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Exhibitions/Dystopia-Utopia-2070)
* presents a view of our world 50 years from now.

The exhibition opened today (February 4) and is on show until March 20 at [Caloundra Regional Gallery](http://www.gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

Curated by *[artisan](https://artisan.org.au/)
*, a Queensland craft and design organisation, and toured with the assistance of the Australian Government’s Visions of Australian program, *Dystopia/Utopia: 2070* is artists’ responses to future scenarios as posed by speculative fiction.

Curator Kevin Wilson said the exhibition looked far into an uncertain future and featured the works of seven artists, chosen for their willingness to push their practice into unknown realms.

**“**The diverse body of work combines sculpture, jewellery, small objects, installation and text, and offers an experience where visitors can explore what a future world may have in store for us,” Mr Wilson said.

“There is an extensive augmented reality component to the physical works, providing a deeper insight into each piece.

“Through augmented reality we can also talk directly to visitors about the work, something that normally only occurs in a one-off curator tour.

“The exhibition also comes with an education kit which covers the school curriculum from upper primary through secondary and is a great resource for teachers.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said when planning for the future, Council always had to consider future scenarios from all angles.

“*[Dystopia/Utopia: 2070](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Exhibitions/Dystopia-Utopia-2070)
* will give us an insight through a different lens and I’m sure will provide a fascinating perspective of 2070,” Cr Landsberg said.

“I’m particularly delighted to see the educational component on offer with this exhibition.

“The gallery does a wonderful job providing exhibition-related activities for children of all ages, and this curriculum-based digital experience adds a fresh new element to engage youth in art.”

Caloundra Regional Gallery Manager and Curator Jo Duke said the gallery had a diverse and engaging public program and events line up for 2022.

“As well as our nine engaging exhibitions featuring leading artists, we present aligned events including artist workshops, exhibition tours, online artist talks and up-late events,” Ms Duke said.

“Our programs are developed for a diverse audience and community and school group tour bookings are welcomed.”

Caloundra Regional Gallery is open Tuesday to Friday 10am–4pm and Saturday and Sunday 10am–2pm and can be found at 22 Omrah Avenue, Caloundra. Entry to the gallery is free and the space is accessible to wheelchairs and strollers.
