Experience a massive orchestral sound with the combined power of the Sunshine Coast Symphony Orchestra and the Sunshine Coast Youth Orchestra joining forces to bring a powerful concert of classical and film music favourites to Venue 114 on Sunday July 24, 2022.

*The Power of Two* integrates two growing orchestras to create the largest orchestra to ever play on the Sunshine Coast.

Conducted by Adrian King and Chelsea Eunson, the concert features a piece by the musically talented 12-year-old Kyan Pennell, a hinterland resident who tragically passed away recently.

This will be the debut performance of this arrangement.

Other pieces in the concert include Holst’s Mars from The Planets, Sibelius’ Finlandia and Han’s Zimmer’s Pirates of the Caribbean, At World’s End.
