Gain the skills and confidence you need to write that romantic happily-ever-after story with Sunshine Coast Libraries’ fun and interactive romance writing workshop.

Proudly presented by Sunshine Coast Libraries in partnership with the Queensland Writer’s Centre, the workshop will take place at Venue 114 on Saturday, April 30, at 9am.

More than writing a love story, the six-hour hands-on workshop will have participants sharpening their craft to develop strong lead characters, intriguing plots, captivating opening lines and create tension.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said it was wonderful to see the Sunshine Coast Libraries offer these kinds of workshops to budding writers.

“If you’ve got a story idea, come along to this workshop where you’ll learn vital techniques and writing habits to help develop, draft and improve your work,” Cr Law said.

“Don’t miss this opportunity to learn from popular romance writer Ally Blake as she facilitates this exclusive workshop supporting literary enthusiasts across all genres.”

Ally has sold more than four million books worldwide and was looking forward to delivering the workshop and revealing her tips and tricks on what it takes to create a riveting romantic read.

“Avid romance writers will learn how to use emotional conflict for a gripping ‘will they or won’t they’ romantic story,” Ms Blake said.

“Whether you’re a seasoned author or just starting out, this workshop will develop your writing style that will have readers falling in love with your work.

“I look forward to presenting a rich, intensive day spent discussing how to build beloved characters, absorbing plots and heart-warming happy ever afters.”
