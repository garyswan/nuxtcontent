Award winning theatre makers Shock Therapy Productions will proudly present their latest work ‘Undertow’ at Venue 114 on Wednesday August 3.

This new original work will explore themes of resilience, mental health, relationships and identity from a performing arts company that has built a reputation for meaningful, thought-provoking and dynamic performance.

‘Undertow’ is an honest and powerful look at the hidden forces beneath the surface that move us and determine the choices we make and the actions we take.

Centering around a high school community, the show follows a group of individuals, from a range of backgrounds, all dealing with their own unique challenges.

Shock Therapy Productions draws on a range of film conventions and physical theatre techniques to push their signature style in a new direction, blurring the line between different realities.

The result is storytelling that is fluid and inventive, sweeping you up in its current as the story pulls you deeper.

Nominated for three Matilda Awards (2021) including Best New Australian Work, Best Independent Production and Best Sound Design (Guy Webster) this is an opportunity not to be missed.

Venue 114 manager Louise Thompson said she was once again looking forward to hosting Shock Therapy Productions to showcase their powerful and thought-provoking performance.

“Their performances are incredibly moving, and the subject matter is so important to youth audiences,” Ms Thompson said.

 “The post-performance workshop provides a unique opportunity for students on the Sunshine Coast to explore these themes through performing arts.”

**When:** Wednesday, August 3 2022

**Location:** Venue 114, 114 Sportsmans Parade, Bokarina  

**Time:** Show 10-11am; Workshop 11.30am – 12.30pm
