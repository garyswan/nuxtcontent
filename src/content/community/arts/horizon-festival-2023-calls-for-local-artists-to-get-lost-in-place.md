This year’s Horizon Festival has barely dimmed from memory and already the wheels are turning as organisers prepare for 2023.

As part of the Festival’s *Homegrown* program, organisers are now calling for submissions from established Sunshine Coast based artists to present new or existing works to participate in the 2023 *Homegrown* program, ‘The Forgotten Coast’.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold said the festival was seeking projects that uncovered forgotten or invisible places on the Sunshine Coast and brought them to life.

“A forgotten place might be an abandoned or vacant building or perhaps a hidden outdoor space—the challenge, is to take that space and make it memorable again,” Ms Clissold said.

“We want artists to abandon their current perceptions of a space and get lost in their creative practice, experimenting and pushing the boundaries in response to the space they’ve selected.

“Applications are open to artists working across visual arts, dance, theatre, music and interdisciplinary artforms.”

Three projects or works will be selected and presented as part of Horizon Festival 2023, with successful applicants receiving mentorship from an inspirational artist of the applicant’s choice, selected in consultation with Horizon Festival.

The Festival strongly encourages submissions from Kabi Kabi artists and Jinibara artists and all people of First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) descent.

Sunshine Coast Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said this years’ Horizon Festival Homegrown program was an fabulous encouragement for local artists to explore new spaces to extend and develop their practice.

“The opportunity to push your experience and skill set forward through mentoring or funding could be pivotal in developing new work, which could ultimately be delivered as part of the festival. Simply moving through the process should be a genuinely valuable development opportunity,” Cr Baberowski said.

“More than 20,000 arts lovers attended the 2022 festival and with audiences growing each year, the opportunities for exposure are exciting and valuable.

“I encourage all artists to be bold and imaginative in considering this initiative and to embrace all the benefits this opportunity potentially provides.”

While only Sunshine Coast LGA artists can apply, consideration will be given to collaborations with artists from outside the local region.

Applications close December 5 and successful artists will receive the good news mid-December.

Council will host two application information sessions on November 22 and 24 and anyone thinking of applying is encouraged to attend.
