Bringing the outside in, [Caloundra Regional Gallery](/Users/pm031/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/CGI04MS5/gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au)
&#x20;delves into a rarely seen side of public art with an engaging new exhibition *[The Art of Making: art in public spaces](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Exhibitions/Art-of-Making)
*.

The exhibition is on show December 10 to January 30 at Caloundra Regional Gallery, 22 Omrah Avenue, Caloundra.

Sunshine Coast Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the exhibition was an unusual collaboration between Caloundra Regional gallery and [Urban Art Projects (UAP),](https://www.uapcompany.com/)
who are internationally recognised for delivering public art projects for well over 25years.

“This showcase exhibition will give visitors a rare glimpse into the creative journey behind many public artworks, from concept to completion,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Public Art is a very tangible snapshot on who we are as a community, our values and our evolving culture, and certainly our growing regional collection reflects well on our journey as a community so far.

“What’s unusual about this showcase is that it goes well behind the scenes in what will be a fascinating look at the development of some well know iconic public art pieces and public art in general.

“You’ll find small-scale maquettes, designs, fabrication elements, videos and images of artworks that inhabit community parks, urban zones, universities and public spaces both regionally and from far away.”

Caloundra Regional Gallery Manager and Curator Jo Duke said the collaboration had been two years in the making.

“UAP has been advocating for art in public spaces around the globe for 28 years, working with artists to bring concepts to life,” Ms Duke said.

“The show honours celebrated artists who work in the public realm and provides visitors with a unique opportunity to connect with the processes behind the art we enjoy in our community spaces.”

Daniel Tobin, Co-Founder UAP / Founder, Art Makers said he had fond memories of the first UAP workshop in the western suburbs of Brisbane.

“My father, brother and I would be huddled together, drinking hot tea, discussing the day's work and dreaming big,” Mr Tobin said.

“This exhibition is a celebration of the artists, their visionary projects and the many collaborators we’ve worked with over the past three decades.

“We’re thankful to have played a role in realising some pretty incredible things, and hope you’ll be inspired to one day do the same.”

The exhibition unveils prototypes behind finished artworks as well as raw materials, moulds and fabrication elements used by some of our nation’s leading public artists – inspiring a deeper appreciation of the work that goes on behind the scenes.

The works explore a range of narratives, including cultural connection. Robert Andrew’s (Yawuru) *Garabara* is inspired by traditional storytelling and his people’s traditional language, *Water is Life* by Elisa Jane Carmichael (Quandamooka/ Yoolooburrabee) honours ancestral waterways and the traditions of the people who used them, and Lyndon Davis’ (Gubbi Gubbi) *Helimon* is a towering replica of his family’s traditional shield.

Caloundra Regional Gallery is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10am. Entry is free and the gallery has all abilities access.
