A Sunshine Coast film and TV competition that uncovers the region’s best up-and-coming screenwriters and producers has announced its 2023 winners.

Each winner receives mentoring, support and funding to elevate their projects, produce them locally, and deliver the final product at the Sunny Coast Showdown showcase festival on June 24.

&#x20;also gives locals the opportunity to showcase their talents nationally and globally, with the potential to kickstart a career in the screen industry.

Winner of one of two scripted categories, Ryan Butler, a video editor and director from Beerwah, hopes the accolade will help him return to an industry he loves.

“I’m shaking, I’m blown away,” Mr Butler said.

“I took a pause from making film to have a family and this year was all about getting back into it.”

The Showdown received about 90 high quality submissions from local writers in scripted, unscripted, music video and Indigenous categories, with organisers stunned at the amount of talent the event has uncovered.

Learning and development professional, Adam Szubrich, moved to Mooloolaba during Covid and was ‘in shock’ after winning the second scripted category with his screenplay, Slow Dating.

“I did not expect to make a professional film on the coast,” he said.

“I thought moving here was potentially limiting or destroying my writing career. This is bloody amazing.”

Former federal cop from Bokarina, Stephen Walker, is the committee’s choice winner and said he was overjoyed his comedy script, Stripper Trade Off, was chosen. He said the Showdown proves there’s a bright future for a local screen industry.

“I’m continually overwhelmed by the industry talent situated here,” he said.

“We have the will here, the talent here, the heart – it’s only a matter of time before that’s followed by investment and bigger productions.”

Creative technologist, Jessie Hughes, won the Powderfinger Music Video category and said she would love to help grow the industry on the Sunshine Coast.

“We live in the most beautiful place. To have a dream lifestyle and the dream job at the Coast - that’s the dream,” she said.
