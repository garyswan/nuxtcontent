Living, learning and connecting like never before … get ready for a fun-filled program of activities brought to you by Sunshine Coast Council.

[Sunshine Coast Libraries](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;are hosting an exciting calendar of events and workshops for people of all ages to celebrate [Queensland Seniors](https://qldseniorsmonth.org.au/)
&#x20;month in October.

Highlights include the chance to relive the bold fashions, big hair and wonderful soundtrack of the Aussie film classic, *Muriel’s Wedding*, and fascinating workshops about health and wellness, tips on taking great snaps on your mobile phone, and how you can make a difference as a volunteer.

Queensland Seniors Month recognises the valuable contribution of seniors in the community, whether as a volunteer or in the workforce, as a community leader or carer, grandparent or advocate.

Seniors Month also provides opportunities to promote positive community attitudes towards older people and ageing, facilitate community participation and enhance community connections. The initiatives align with the [Queensland Government and Council on the Ageing](https://cotaqld.org.au/)
&#x20;(COTA) Queensland’s vision of building age-friendly communities.

COTA’s theme this year is *Social Connections* and connecting with one another has never been more important. Queensland Senior’s Month will provide opportunities for people of all ages, cultures, and abilities to connect through inclusive events and activities.
