Sunshine Coast Council is calling for entries from artists across the nation for the acquisitive Sunshine Coast Art Prize 2022, one of the most prestigious regional 2D art prizes in Australia.

This visual arts award is a showcase for outstanding contemporary 2D arts practice in Australia and offers an enticing major cash prize of $25,000 sponsored by Argon Law and Sunshine Coast Council.

There are four prize categories including three professionally judged categories and the popular people’s choice award. This year’s judge is Curator, Contemporary Australian Art, QAGOMA, Ellie Buttrose.

Submissions can be made online at [gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Art-Prizes/Sunshine-Coast-Art-Prize/Entry)
&#x20;with entries closing 5pm, May 9 2022.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowksi said this was the 17th year for the significant art award.

“The Sunshine Coast Art Prize is the flagship event for the Sunshine Coast’s Regional Gallery in Caloundra, attracting entries from emerging and established artists across the nation,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The winning entry is acquired into the Sunshine Coast Art Collection, ensuring our collection remains at the cutting edge of contemporary art practice.”

The Sunshine Coast Art Collection currently features 800 individual works with a total estimated value of more than $1 million.

“Each year I really look forward to seeing the final selection and the impressive standard of works submitted and it’s always intriguing to see how the nation’s artists will present their 2D practice in these turbulent times of 2022.” Cr Baberowski said.

The 40 artworks selected as finalists will be exhibited at the Caloundra Regional Gallery from August 26 to October 16.

The Sunshine Coast Art Prize 2022 offers a prize pool of more than $40,000 in cash and prizes including:

*   an acquisitive major prize of $25,000 cash sponsored by Argon Law and Sunshine Coast Council
*   a non-acquisitive Highly Commended prize of $5000 sponsored by the De Deyne family
*   a non-acquisitive People’s Choice prize of $2500 sponsored by Caloundra Chamber of Commerce
