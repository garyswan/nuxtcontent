A community champion whose efforts have helped feed thousands of people in need has been named the Sunshine Coast Citizen of the Year.

Michele Lipner has been honoured for her dedication to helping others, reducing food waste and advocating for vital behaviour change.

A Coolum local, Michele is the founder and coordinator of the local chapter of [OzHarvest](https://www.ozharvest.org/)
, Australia’s leading food rescue organisation.

Every month, Michele and her team of volunteers, collect more than 15,000 kilos of quality surplus food from 40 food donors and re-distribute it to 45 agencies to feed people in need.

The local organisation raises more than awareness, delivering a range of programs such as ‘Cooking for a Cause’ and ‘Food Education and Sustainability Training’, to help empower the community make great sustainability choices.

Sunshine Coast Council Acting Mayor Rick Baberowski said people like Michele formed the backbone of our Sunshine Coast community.

“This year, we received 63 Sunshine Coast Australia Day nominations across seven categories with a common thread weaving through each one — every nominee was praised for their selflessness and their dedication to helping others,” Cr Baberowksi said.

“Together the nominations form a glorious account of the actions of everyday people who make a difference. It’s a humbling account and every nominee should feel very proud.

“The Sunshine Coast Australia Day Awards provide an essential platform to recognise the efforts of the special individuals, charities and organisations that support our region and to say thank you.

“On behalf of Sunshine Coast — to all those nominated both this year and in previous years — a sincere thank you.”

### **The 2023 Senior Citizen of the Year is Nambour’s Gary Langford.**

Since moving to the area in 1990, Gary has been a dedicated Nambour stalwart, offering time and leadership in many roles across multiple organisations and charities.

Gary is the President of the Nambour Local Ambulance Committee (LAC) where he has served since 1999. A passionate ambulance service advocate, Gary has received numerous awards for his service.

### **The 2023 Young Citizen of the Year is Mason Hope-Kassulke.**

Mason received a glowing nomination for his advocacy and support of mental health, his volunteer work with 4 Paws Animal Rescue and his involvement with arts planning for the region.

Mason is an award-winning artist and songwriter and uses this as a platform to raise awareness and generate funds and support for mental health.
