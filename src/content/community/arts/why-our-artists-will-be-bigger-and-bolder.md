An impressive array of artists and creative industries have gained vital funding that will help them “be bold and deliver bigger programs’’.

Sunshine Coast Council has announced a $170,000 funding boost to artists and arts organisations through the Arts and Heritage Levy with the support of the Queensland Government. 

It is aimed at increasing participation in creative arts, supporting First Nations endeavours and growing audiences. A total of $130,000 has been dedicated to stage one of a new funding program that provides multi-year financial support.

The Creative Industries Investment Program, supports local artists to upscale existing programs, events and initiatives, ultimately providing quality creative arts experiences and cultural benefit to the region.

Eligible applicants can request between $5,000-$20,000 each year for projects that support the Sunshine Coast Arts Plan 2018 – 2038, with more significant funding available to projects that demonstrate existing and ongoing regional cultural benefit.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the program was jointly funded through The Sunshine Coast Arts and Heritage Levy and the Sunshine Coast Regional Arts Development Fund (RADF)

“[RADF](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Arts-Funding/Regional-Arts-Development-Fund)
 is a grant program partially funded through the Queensland government,” Cr Baberowski said.

“It is designed to provide financial support, twice per year, for emerging and established artists; creative practitioners and producers to kick-start an idea or further develop an initiative.

“These grants can provide pivotal creative support, more development pathways and key opportunities to try new techniques, test and further concepts to see if they are viable.

“Initiatives that are viable and will provide an ongoing contribution to our regional arts landscape can then move forward to the next level of program funding, which provides the financial certainty to take calculated risks, be bolder and deliver bigger and better outcomes.”

Sunshine Coast Council Creative Arts and Events Coordinator Janine Symons said council received 13 applications for the new annual program, requesting more than $260,000.

“Council has allocated $130,000, for the first of three years funding, to seven diverse local projects,” Ms Symons said.

“One applicant which receiving maximum funding is the Sunshine Coast Creative Alliance, recognising their significant contribution to supporting regional arts sector development.

“This program funding will support the alliance deliver five established professional development initiatives, including Big Chats, Critical Light and The Refinery.

“Projects span arts, health, education, business and tourism sectors and will employ more than 50 artists and cultural workers.

“Another organisation receiving significant funding is Red Chair.

“Their Compass Project, a micro touring circuit, will deliver nine performing arts tours comprising 36 concerts annually across the Sunshine Coast, providing audiences with an exciting range of music, comedy, cabaret and dance.”
