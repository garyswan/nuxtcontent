The people, history and landscape of a modern country town have been encapsulated in an inspired artistic centrepiece.

Depicting strength and resilience, Sunshine Coast Council’s newest public art commission, has been unveiled in [Turner Park](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/experience-sunshine-coast/beaches-and-parks/beaches-and-parks-directory/turner-park)
, Beerwah.

*Mountain People* is a 1.5 metre contemporary bronze statue featuring half rock, half human figures balanced on top of each other and set on a basalt rock platform.

The uplifting sculpture sits centre stage in Turner Park, offering easy viewing access from the Turner Park walkway and grassed areas, encouraging people to come further into the park.

*Mountain People* was created by local artist Tory Richards following an expression of interest process and cast in bronze at Perides Art Projects in Brisbane.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski funded the sculpture from divisional funding after identifying the need to extend the public art trail further into Turner Park. 

“This remarkable bronze on basalt artwork beautifully complements the murals and public art in the surrounding township and provides one more opportunity to enjoy the parklands and invite further visitation to Beerwah,” Cr Baberowski said. 

“The work depicts aspiration, resilience, and our need to remain balanced when confronted by change, something Beerwah locals know all about. 

“The sculpture also recognises the importance of mutual support in setting goals and in building successful vibrant communities.  It also directly draws upon the social history and close relationship the community has with the Nationally Heritage-Listed Glass House Mountains.

“The work is another very welcome addition to the [Sunshine Coast Public Art Collection](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/collections/public-art-collection)
, which can be viewed at [gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://gallery.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.”

Artist Tory Richards and Cr Rick Baberowski unveil 'Mountain People' in Turner Park, Beerwah

Artist Tory Richards said the figures, balanced precariously on top of each other offered an opportunity for contemplation and inspiration.

“All aspects of our lives are interconnected,” Ms Richards said.

“That connectedness gives a sense of who we are and what is important.

“My work aims to move the viewer, to access their personal space and help to find a certain peaceful resolution to an issue.”
