It is out with the old and in with the new. Skateboarders will be dropping into a brand new eight-metre-wide half pipe in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, just in time for the summer school holidays.

Due to age and safety concerns, the extremely popular existing metal half pipe, adjacent to the main concrete skate park within the Maleny Showgrounds, will be demolished in early June 2023.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said he was pleased the much-needed upgrade to the facility will soon be underway.

“We have been working closely with the Maleny community on this project,” Cr Johnston said.

“We’ve heard loud and clear that these free recreational facilities for youth, families and the young-at-heart are so important to support physical and mental health.

“The Council is pleased to see the skate culture expanding in our region, keeping our community active and connected.

“With skateboarding debuting at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games happening in our own backyard in the not-too-distant future, this will mean even greater interest in this extremely accessible sport.”

The new, eight-metre-wide half pipe will feature four-to-five foot transitions and a high performance Skatelite wear surface. Tenders have now closed, and construction work is expected to start over the coming months.

“We know the demolition and construction of this facility will inconvenience users,” Cr Johnston said.

“The main concrete skate park within the Maleny Showgrounds remains open for action ensuring skateboarders can continue enjoying the sport.

“In the meantime, we thank everyone for their patience while we construct the new facility.

“You can also head out and explore one of the other 26 skate parks across our region.”
