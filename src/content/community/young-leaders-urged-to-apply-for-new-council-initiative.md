Applications are now open for 15-24 year olds to be part of an exciting new era in local government and a first for the region with the creation of the Sunshine Coast Youth Council.

It comes as [Queensland Youth Week](https://www.des.qld.gov.au/youthweek/home)
&#x20;(10-18 April) is well underway, which encourages youth to make a positive contribution to the society they live in.

Young people keen to make a difference in the Sunshine Coast community while representing their peers are encouraged to apply for the two-year program that aims to provide them with the opportunity to develop skills in communication, public speaking, leadership, have a voice, raise issues, exchange ideas and learn about local government and community issues.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the council initiative was a direct action from the [Sunshine Coast Council Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
. 

“Just 15 spots are up for grabs and I anticipate they will be hotly contested,” Cr Law said.

“It would be terrific to see representation from all Divisions across the Sunshine Coast Local Government area so I encourage all aspiring leaders to apply.

“This will not only look good on their CV but equip them with vital well-rounded skills for the future.

“Our Community Strategy strongly focuses on inclusive communities and actively encouraging young people to have a say in decisions that impact them and establish ways to foster youth leadership.”

The Youth Council will foster young people’s skills in decision-making processes, while also helping them learn about communication and program development skills; discover a better understanding of the roles and functions of local government; highlight issues and exchange ideas; meet new people; and interact and learn from Sunshine Coast civic leaders.

Sunshine Coast Youth Council meetings will be scheduled monthly. Each meeting will be held for approximately 1.5 hours (4.30-6pm). Outside of meeting times, professional and personal development sessions will also be an expectation for member attendance.

Applications can be made by emailing a cover letter to commdevelopment\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au by Friday 7 May. The letter should detail:

*   Why you are interested in joining the Youth Council 
*   Your particular areas of interest
*   Contact details
*   Age 

Sunshine Coast Youth Council is expected to start by June.
