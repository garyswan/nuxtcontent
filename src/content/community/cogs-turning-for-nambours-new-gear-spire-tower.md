Nambour residents large and small are in for a real treat when they see the next stage of Quota Memorial Park playground improvements – a 7-metre-high ‘Spire Gear Tower’.

A contoured rock wall, climbing rope net, banister slide, internal climbers with various levels of challenge, a rope elevator, and a huge spiral slide will all be part of the park’s refresh.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was excited works would soon start on the impressive junior and toddler play space which is sure to please the kids.

“I’m very pleased to see the community already using the new 1.7 hectare open space park extension which was part of Stage 1 works completed in January 2022,” Cr Law said.

“With Quota Memorial Park being such a popular location for families with varying aged children to visit, council has redesigned part of the playground’s layout to make it more assessable for all.

“The artist impressions show various sized ‘gears’ on the outside of the tower to provide a meaningful connection to the park’s history.

“The old playground was based on the 1894 Moreton Central Sugar Mill theme and the skate park features a cog from the mill.

“We designed a playground for the compact area, with sensory play elements which weave in the heritage of the area to create sense of intrigue and imagination for children moving up the spire.

“While the playground upgrade will also see a new table tennis table installed in the junior play area, the existing ‘Evos’ play unit will be relocated within the play space and the basket swing moved to the toddler play area.

“Parents will be pleased to know the view lines between the Youth Activity Precinct and the junior and toddler play spaces will be improved by replacing the picket style fence with a pool style fence.

“The tower’s bubble windows, hole panels, and rope elevator all help to provide a great view for the kids, while allowing parents and carers to see into the tower for supervision.

“Council is continuing to give this area a green injection with additional shade trees around the playground, and an additional shade sail also to be installed.

“It’s been wonderful to watch the works take place transforming the space into a green, family-friendly area for existing residents, visitors and new people set to call Nambour home in the future.”

Works start the first week of August.

This project is part of the Petrie Creek Parklands Open Space Master Plan which was endorsed by council in late 2017 and is delivers on council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy to provide long-term direction to guide growth and shape the future of our region.
