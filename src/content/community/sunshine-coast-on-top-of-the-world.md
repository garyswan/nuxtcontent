The word is out with travel lovers agreeing our very own Sunshine Coast is the most loved destination in the world.

Online ‘word of mouth’ revealed the 100 most loved destinations around the world in an intensive study of data – about 1.6 billion online conversations and content pieces publicly available about 21,330 global destinations.

The number one ranking for the Sunshine Coast was announced by the **Tourism Sentiment Index**, which tracked the online sentiment of travellers to determine how people felt about destinations around the world.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson acknowledged that there were a broad range of individuals and groups who have contributed to the well-deserved recognition for the Sunshine Coast.

“Clearly the local tourism industry are the face for visitors but I would also like to acknowledge the many volunteers – from the hinterland to the beaches - who contribute to the outstanding visitor experience we have been acknowledged for,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I’m sure our residents played a big part in those online conversations, those who hosted friends and family and took them to our great tourism venues including cafes and restaurants, attractions and events.

“You have helped our local businesses survive and our economy bounce back.

“And while this is a great accolade, our industry needs more help and hands.

“There are more than 150 Sunshine Coast based vacancies currently listed on the [Queensland Tourism and Hospitality Jobs hub](https://www.workinparadise.com.au/search-results?suburb=Maroochydore&postCode=4558&industryId=0&page=1&daysToSearch=30&sort=date&distance=50&state=QLD)
&#x20;so, if you want to be part of Sunshine Coast’s success story, go online and find your perfect position.”

Right now, many businesses are facing staff shortages as a result of a range of factors including the impacts of COVID-19.

Sunshine Coast Council, in collaboration with Visit Sunshine Coast, has developed the Gap Year Sunshine Coast initiative which aims to attract, develop and retain great staff in the region by showcasing the lifestyle, opportunity and jobs available on the Sunshine Coast right now.

Visit Sunshine Coast CEO Matt Stoeckel said with international borders set to open, the fact that the Sunshine Coast resonated so strongly overseas highlights the potential we have to regrow our visitor numbers.

“We have been using the last year to emphasise the Sunshine Coast’s nature-based experiences, along with our food, health and wellness assets, and this survey shows that our messages have really struck a chord with potential travellers,” Mr Stoeckel said.
