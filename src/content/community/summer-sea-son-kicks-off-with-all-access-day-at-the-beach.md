UPDATE: [All Access Day at the Beach has been cancelled](https://oursc.com.au/community/all-access-day-at-the-beach-cancelled)


Come along for a tide of good fun on Friday, December 2, for the second annual All Access Day at the Beach and celebrate International Day of People with Disability.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was proud to partner with Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club and members of the disability sector to bring such a special event to our community.

“We are always seeking to make the Sunshine Coast more accessible and inclusive for everyone and the All Access Day at the Beach highlights and celebrates the importance of doing so,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The afternoon will be one for the whole family to enjoy with all-abilities activities on the beach and in the park, access mats, beach wheelchairs, Mooloolaba Starfish Nippers, an afternoon barbecue and entertainment to get everyone involved.

“A sensory tent will also be available on the day, as we acknowledge that some members of the community need a safe space to retreat between the festivities.”

Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club president Matthew Horder recognised the importance of beaches being accessible for all members of the community so everyone could enjoy a day at the beach.

“We are proud to be working with Sunshine Coast Council on these great initiatives and to support another key event for our community on our beach,” Mr Horder said.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;provided a long-term framework for how council and our community would work together to advance our shared goal of a strong community

“In Australia it is estimated that more than 17% of the population are living with disability\*,” Cr Law said.

“Principles underpinning council’s commitment to access and inclusion are equity, respect, dignity and participation.

“Be sure to come down on Friday, December 2 for an afternoon of family fun!”

This event is proudly supported by Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club, NDIS, Mooloolaba Starfish Nippers, Cerge, Alliance Community, Maxima, Wellways, Compass, 91.1 Hot FM, Montrose, Connect Rugby League, Inspires & Co, Our Sensory Space, UniSC, Get Going Support, Disable Surfers Association and Steps.
