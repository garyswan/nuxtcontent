Dicky Beach walkers and cyclists will be able to take advantage of coastal views thanks to a 500 metre section of the coastal pathway starting construction next week.  

The new route between Cooroora Street to Dicky Beach Park at Beerburrum Street will become part of  the 73 kilometre [coastal pathway network](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Pathways-tracks-and-trails/Coastal-Pathway)
, Sunshine Coast’s longest and most popular shared pathway, extending from Bells Creek in the south to Coolum in the north.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said he was pleased preliminary works would start next Wednesday (beginning April 13).

“Following on from the Dicky Beach Precinct Plan Stage 1 completion last year, I’m glad to see this section of the Dicky Beach Coastal Pathway being delivered for the benefit of our community,” Cr Landsberg said.

“When enjoying a walk, cycle or stroll at Dicky Beach, residents and visitors will be able take advantage of the beauty of our coastline, rather than travel along Elizabeth Street.

“As part of the works, two new car spaces and an extra motorcycle bay at the Lower Neill Street carpark will also further benefit our community.”

Council will provide updates to locals and businesses to keep them across construction timeframes and localities.

The 3.2 kilometre stretch between Currimundi Beach to Moffat Beach, which includes this Dicky Beach section, is a ‘high priority missing link’ in Sunshine Coast Council’s Coastal Pathway Master Plan.
