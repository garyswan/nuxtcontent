Tenpin Bowling Australia has announced Suncity Bowl on the Sunshine Coast will be the host of the 2022 International Bowling Federation (IBF) World Cup. 

The biennial event, presented by QubicaAMF, will see the best tenpin bowlers in the world descend on Australia to compete for the most prestigious individual and team awards in world bowling. 

In partnership with the Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council, the IBF World Cup will run from 11-23 November and will be proceeding after the Para Bowling World Cup from 3-10 November. 

With 750 competitors from a minimum of 48 teams (24 men’s and 24 women’s) set to descend on the Sunshine Coast for the World Cup, Tenpin Bowling Australia CEO Rohan O’Neill said he was looking forward to hosting the first edition of the revamped event. 

“Tenpin Bowling Australia is excited to have the Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council as partners to host the 2022 International Bowling Federation World Cup in Australia,” he said.

“Recently, the host venue Suncity Tenpin became the sport’s first National High Performance and Community Centre which aims to develop the next generation of tenpin bowling talent in Australia.

“It will be a great opportunity to welcome the world’s top athletes and to continue growing the sport in Australia.”

It also marks another historic milestone in the sport as it will be the first ever IBF Para Bowling World Cup to be held with 24 nations set to compete. 

Tourism and Sport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said that come November the Sunshine Coast would become the global epicentre of tenpin bowling. 

“We’re backing the IBF Tenpin Bowling World Cup and Para Bowling World Cup because they strike a double win for sport and the visitor economy,” Mr Hinchliffe said. 

“Tenpin bowling’s twin world cups will bring competitors, support crew and spectators to the Sunshine Coast from around the country and around the world. 

“When visitors arrive for major events, they stay longer to explore the Sunshine Coast’s many unique tourism experiences and support local jobs. 

“Event visitors need places to stay, transport and somewhere to enjoy the Sunshine Coast’s fresh, world-class cuisine. 

“Throughout November, tenpin bowling is predicted to frame a $3.5 million bonus and 20,000 visitor nights for the Sunshine Coast’s tourism economy.” 

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said it was an exciting new partnership between Tenpin Bowling Australia and the Council. 

“It’s a huge deal to be the host destination for the first ever tenpin bowling World Cup events to be held in Australia, we can’t wait to showcase the region’s many attractions to a global audience,” he said. 

Tenpin Bowling Australia’s investment in the Suncity National High Performance and Community Centre (NHPCC), will further promote the Sunshine Coast as an accessible sports destination and a high-performance sports training location. 

International Bowling Federation Interim President Martin Faba said he was looking forward to seeing the inaugural event come to life later this year. 

“Australia is one of the leading nations for world sport and to showcase the true athleticism of bowling there can be no bigger stage than Sunshine Coast, Queensland,” he said. 

“Hosting the inaugural IBF World Cup and Para Bowling World Cup presented by QubicaAMF is in very safe hands with Tenpin Bowling Australia who have shown phenomenal commercial awareness and have grown as a national federation during the global pandemic. 

“This is a great opportunity for bowling and the growth of the sport from grass roots to elite in Australia with both the Commonwealth Games 2026 and Brisbane 2032 part of the legacy strategy,” he added. 

The 2022 International Bowling Federation World Cup and Para Bowling World Cup will be held from 3-23 November 2022.
