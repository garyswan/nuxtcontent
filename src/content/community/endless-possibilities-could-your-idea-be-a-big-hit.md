Budding entrepreneurs and innovators are being given the chance to turn their dreams into a reality.

This comes as entries open for the [2023 Mayor’s Telstra Innovation Awards](https://www.studysunshinecoast.com.au/mayors-telstra-innovation-awards-2023/)
.

Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with Telstra and Study Sunshine Coast, will deliver the fun and exciting awards program that is open to all Sunshine Coast students in Years 9 to 12. 

There will be more than $10,000 in prizes to share for students who work in teams of up to three to create, innovate and collaborate, plus they will work with some of the region’s most successful mentors to further develop their creative concept.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson, who has been a champion of these awards since 2016, said the program inspired innovation and creativity through the development of a new creative idea, business solution and/or a new use of technology.

“One of the great outcomes of the awards is connecting students with industry mentors to help them gain valuable real-life work experience, understand their potential customers, and develop a prototype,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Last year we saw 10 finalist teams from five schools present an amazing array of creative ideas, including the winners from Suncoast Christian College who invented Bird Bell – a device that emits a radio frequency to deter birds and prevent injuries by the likes of swooping magpies.

“The possibilities through this program are truly endless, and I encourage students to get together with their school mates, form a team and start thinking about that great app or invention. I can’t wait to see what the 2023 applicants come up with.”

Telstra Regional Engagement Manager Matt Thornton said it was wonderful to see the Mayor’s Telstra Innovation Awards power into their seventh year on the Sunshine Coast.

“The awards aim to drive the youth in our communities to look at technology as a tool for innovation, rather than just a source of entertainment and fun,’’ Mr Thornton said.

“We aim to educate the students not only about technology and innovation, entrepreneurship and business skills, but also have them understand that world-class ideas and businesses don’t have to be based in major cities to be successful.’’

Study Sunshine Coast Program Director Tracey Coobula said the awards entry criteria had been refreshed to include region specific suggested topics to help students looking for direction on their innovative ideas, creative concepts, and business solutions.

“The ideas and business solutions are limited only by the students’ imaginations,” Ms Coobula said.

“They could develop a new idea for transport, health, the environment, the underprivileged or the use of existing technology in a new way to solve a community, environmental or business challenge.”
