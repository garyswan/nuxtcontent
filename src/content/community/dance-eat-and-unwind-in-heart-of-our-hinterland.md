Hip hop workshops, face painting, mouthwatering eats, line dancing classes and street art will be the highlights of a free community day on Saturday, October 15.

Locals and visitors will be treated to creative workshops from inspiring local talent, live music, and “yoga for everyone’’ at the Beerwah Heart Precinct - an indoor/outdoor facility and social space located in the centre of the beautiful hinterland town.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said the community day offered a great opportunity to metaphorically throw your arms around each other and share in what will be a lovely community ‘get together’ day.

“We all now know that more resilient mental health and well-being is paramount, and that being part of something greater than ourselves helps us feel more positive in such complex times,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The jam-packed program has something for everyone, even if it’s just the visit to the beautiful Beerwah and district heart precinct, it will be a lovely outing while fostering our connections to each other.

“Discover a new passion with creative workshops, take part in the wellness classes or simply come and embrace good food, music and fun.

“The Beerwah Heart Community Day will come to life as our contribution to Queensland Mental Health Week.

“The event will support the important things that help people maintain positive mental health and wellbeing – awareness, belonging and connection.

“There will be yoga for everyone, face painting for the kids, a live street art demonstration, hip hop dances classes and so much more to spark interest for all ages.

“I encourage locals and visitors to come along and exchange some time in this inclusive and free family-friendly event.”

Queensland Mental Health Week is an annual awareness week which aims to shine a spotlight on individual and community mental health and wellbeing.
