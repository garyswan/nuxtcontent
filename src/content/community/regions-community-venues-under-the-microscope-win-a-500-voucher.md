Sunshine Coast Council is calling all community and religious organisations, sporting clubs, schools and other groups who may operate a community venue to [have their say](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/community-venues-check)
&#x20;for the chance to win a $500 voucher for their organisation.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Community Venues Check-In would run for four weeks from today, Monday, November 8, until Friday, December 3.

“The Sunshine Coast is home to a wide range of community venues. They provide important spaces for activities, programs, services and events within our community,” Cr Law said.

“This Check-In includes all hireable spaces for community use and looks at understanding the region’s community venues better, their capacity and accessibility, plus opportunities so we can help support them in becoming the best well-used and activated spaces.

“One of the priorities of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;is that our region’s community infrastructure is safe, welcoming, inclusive, adaptable, well used and activated.

“Community venues are important in our region, as they bring people together, and help build social capital and community capacity. They also support individuals, families and communities to grow and thrive.”

Council receives a range of enquiries from people looking for meeting spaces in certain locations, and with specific requirements. By sharing information about what the region’s venues have on offer and their overall accessibility and availability, council can help with these enquiries more effectively.

The survey will also assist council to plan for community venues more effectively.

Survey respondents will also be asked if they’re interested in having a central online directory for community venues, so that operators can promote their spaces and be connected with potential hirers.

All venue operators responding to the survey could win a $500 voucher for their organisation. Terms and conditions apply.
