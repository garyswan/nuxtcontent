Sunshine Coast Council is calling on primary-school students wanting the chance to make a real difference to their community to enter the 2021 Sunshine Coast Get Ready Schools Competition.

The competition challenges youngsters to create a 30-second video highlighting the importance of having a “WHAT-IF-PLAN” so everyone knows what to do when disaster strikes.

Hurry, entries close midnight Friday 30 April 2021! Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity.

A grade five team from Nambour’s St Joseph’s Primary School took out the 2020 competition, here’s what their teacher Brett Strathearn had to say about the experience:

“I really encourage parents and teachers to support their kids to enter, whether you win or not, even just putting an entry together inspires really important conversations about what to do in a disaster.

"These conversations could be life-saving, helping your child understand what their role is during a bushfire, flood or other emergency.

“Winning was of course very special and the kids loved showing off their creativity crafting the radio and television commercial.

“They enjoyed every moment of it and I’m sure it was an experience that will stay with them for life.”

**EASY STEPS TO ENTER:**

1.  Primary-school students can enter in teams of one to five people.

2.  Create a 30-second video highlighting the importance of having a “WHAT-IF-PLAN”, so everyone knows what to do when disaster strikes.

3.  Entries are now open and close midnight Friday, 30 April 2021. The winning team will be mentored by council’s disaster management team to create council’s 2021 Get Ready media campaign. Each team member will receive a family evacuation kit. Runner-up prizes include Get Ready packs and emergency kits.For all the details visit the competition
