Sunshine Coast residents are encouraged to have their say on the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan.

The plan will deliver lasting benefits for our community, our economy, and our environment. It will provide a framework for how all levels of government, and the Olympic and Paralympic movement, can work with the community to plan and make decisions in the years ahead. 

Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Sunshine Coast is committed to ensuring that the 2032 Games leave a positive legacy for our region well beyond 2032.

“We would be selling our community short if we did not seek to maximise every opportunity afforded from our involvement in the 2032 Games,” said Mayor Jamieson.

“The Legacy Consultation Paper offers an important opportunity for our community to provide feedback and have their say.”

Nearly 14,000 ideas have been shared as part of planning for the legacy of the Brisbane 2032 OIympic and Paralympic Games.

The Hopes and Dreams submissions as well as feedback from the Brisbane 2032 Legacy Forum held in March form the basis of a consultation paper - Elevate 2042 - released today.

As the name suggests, Elevate 2042 focuses on the years leading up to the Games and the ten year after, in order to maximise the economic, social, environmental and other benefits of hosting this once-in-a-lifetime event.

### Draft themes highlighted in Elevate 2042 include:

*   Sport, health and social inclusion
*   A better future for our environment
*   Connecting regionally and globally
*   Economy, jobs and innovation.

### Key suggestions include:

*   Building the most sustainable venues
*   A First Nations Cultural Centre
*   Construction of ‘Innovation Clusters’ focusing on augmented reality, bio-medical and environmental technology
*   Planting a Legacy Forest
*   Enhanced and inclusive mass transit solutions.

The final Brisbane 2032 Legacy Plan will be released in late 2023, in partnership between the Queensland Government, Australian Government, Brisbane City Council, Sunshine Coast Council, City of Gold Coast, Council of Mayors (SEQ), Australian Olympic Committee, Paralympics Australia, and the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee.

People are encouraged to have their say on Elevate 2042 by visiting [qld.gov.au/about/brisbane2032](https://www.qld.gov.au/about/brisbane2032)
&#x20;to view the Legacy Consultation Paper and survey until 25 June 2023.
