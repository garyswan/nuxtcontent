Increased opportunities for local suppliers and a continuing commitment to environment and sustainability are a highlight of Sunshine Coast Council’s 2023-24 Procurement and Disposal Policy.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said the new policy would continue to prioritise and support local businesses.

“Council’s 2023-24 Procurement and Disposal Policy contains a number of key guidelines, including a Local Preference in Procurement Guideline, which supports Council’s Regional Economic Development Strategy 2013-2033,” Cr Hungerford said.

“This has resulted in Council spending $252 million with local suppliers for the current financial year – to April 30 – which represents 70 per cent of Council’s total purchasing spend.”  

An amendment to the 2023-24 Policy, to further increase the engagement of local suppliers, is the requirement to invite only local suppliers to respond to Request for Quotes up to $500,000.  This is a significant increase to the previous requirement to invite local suppliers only up to $250,000. 

“The 2023-24 Procurement Policy will continue to include an Environment and Sustainability in Procurement Guideline which outlines Council’s framework for, and approach to, conducting contracting activities in an environmentally considerate and sustainable manner,” Cr Hungerford said.

“The new policy will also continue to encourage engagement with First Nation businesses and suppliers with social missions centred on benefitting people who are considered disadvantaged in the local community.

“This resulted in Council spending $812,000 with First Nations businesses during the 2022-23 financial year (to May 31),” Cr Hungerford said. 

“Council will continue to deliver programs which support and assist local [suppliers to win more work with council.”](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Business-Gateway)


The 2023-24 Procurement and Disposal Policy was endorsed by Council at its June 2023 Ordinary Meeting.
