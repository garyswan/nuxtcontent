What’s BushCare? It’s a group of likeminded people who care for the bushland near them –\
Who like to enjoy the outdoors, with the company of others; keep active and connect with nature; and have the flexibility to volunteer when it suits them!

So come along and join your local bushcare working bee.

Morning tea, equipment, gloves and guidance are all provided.
