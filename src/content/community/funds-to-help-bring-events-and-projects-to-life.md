An event that celebrates the “creative spirit of the hinterland’’, community facility upgrades and sporting equipment purchases are among the initiatives to receive a funding boost.

One hundred local community organisations, all striving to improve lives in the region, have gained support through Sunshine Coast Council’s latest Major Grants round.

They will receive a share of almost $600,000 to deliver a range of top-notch community initiatives.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law congratulated all the Major Grant recipients.

“I’m looking forward to seeing many of these projects come to life,” Cr Law said.

“The range of events, projects and activities receiving funding is testament to the vibrant and diverse region we live in.

“Mooloolaba’s Multicultural Moon Festival is back again in September this year, the amenities block at Gheerulla Hall will be refurbished and Connect Rugby League will purchase training and playing equipment to encourage all abilities.”

Major Grant recipient and registered charity, Range of Life Pty Ltd, received $10,000 towards The Rangebow Festival 2023, a four-day arts and culture event conducted at multiple sites across the hinterland communities of Mapleton, Flaxton, Montville and Maleny from August 10-13.

Festival Director Wayne Parcell said The Rangebow Festival celebrated the creative life and spirit of the Blackall Range communities set in the outstanding natural beauty of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland.

“The world-class program includes 30 events delivered in collaboration with local community groups, artisans, businesses, performers and schools,” Mr Parcell said.

“The festival enables a wide variety of rich experiences, including indigenous food and culture, theatre, opera in a chapel, classical and modern music, and a family dance party integrating values of diversity, inclusion, sustainability and reconciliation through education, entertainment, engagement, dialogue and creative activities. 

“Tickets for all events are selling fast, especially the world premiere performances of "IAGO" and "Juggling" - see them before they go to Broadway!

“We thank Sunshine Coast Council for their support to bring this unique event to our hinterland communities.”
