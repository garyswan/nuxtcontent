Forty-five Sunshine Coast migrant residents took the plunge and came out swimmingly after successfully completing Sunshine Coast Council and Royal Life Saving Society Queensland’s Migrant Learn to Swim and Beach Safe Program over the past seven weeks.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said council, in partnership with the Royal Life Saving Society Queensland, were able to offer the highly successful program for the fourth year.

“Participants had the opportunity to learn basic swimming techniques and improve their water confidence skills,” Cr Law said.

“The program concluded with a beach safety session earlier this month to get participants ready to enjoy the wonderful beaches we have on offer on the Sunshine Coast this summer.”   

Royal Life Saving Society Queensland Executive Director Paul Barry congratulated all participants on completing the program.

“Participants learnt floating and survival techniques as well as how to swim,” Mr Barry said.

“At the beach safety session, participants were taught vital beach safety skills about the ocean, safe and unsafe swimming locations (remember to always swim between the yellow and red flags) and learnt about rips and currents.”

Program participant Maria, from Mountain Creek, completed the program this month after moving to the Sunshine Coast from Argentina, South America.

“I registered for the program to improve my swimming technique and am so happy I did,” Maria said.

“The program has made a big difference in my swimming techniques, and it was a great way to meet new people.

“All the participants in the program were like me and were at the same level as me, which made us all feel very comfortable knowing we were all on the same page and wanted to learn more.”
