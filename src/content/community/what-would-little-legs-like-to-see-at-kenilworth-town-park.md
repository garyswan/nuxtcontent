Sunshine Coast Council is planning to improve the playground equipment at Kenilworth Town Park, on the corner of Elizabeth and Charles streets, but we need the communities help!

This district level park has beautiful Bald Cyperus trees, a large playground (with smaller fenced toddler play area), picnic shelters, BBQs, and toilets.

This park offers a variety of different recreational opportunities for locals and visitors to enjoy all year round.

Kenilworth Town Park plays a key role in its rural setting in providing a green space for our community and visitors to socialise and enjoy time outdoors together.

However, some elements of the park are ready for renewal including the play equipment within the fenced toddler play area, as well as the digger and purple coloured comet spinner in the main play area.

The project team are seeking feedback from the community to help guide the selection of new playground equipment.

Make sure you provide your feedback by completing the [survey online](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/kenilworth-playground)
&#x20;before 11 April 2022 by visiting council’s website: [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/kenilworth-playground](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/kenilworth-playground)

The upgrade is part of council’s Infrastructure Renewal Program.

The ideas and feedback received in this engagement will be used to develop a design for the playground renewal for construction in 2022-23 financial year – subject to future capital works approval.
