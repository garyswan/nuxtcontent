Nambour Forecourt Live! is back, bigger than ever and this time shining the spotlight on local singer song writers, craft brewers, artists, circus performers and more!

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said there was no better time than Friday, December 10 to kick off the festive season at the new revamped forecourt in front of council’s Eddie De Vere building on the corner of Currie and Bury streets.

He encouraged residents to bring the whole family down to Nambour Forecourt Live! for a fun, free community event from 2pm to 8.30pm.

“We celebrated the new-look community space in early September with an evening of games, good local food, children’s activities and live music,” Cr Law said.

“It was a successful evening, so council has teamed up again with Peace Run Records to bring you another stellar event.

“There is plenty of seating, grassed areas to roll out a picnic mat, shady trees and the area is canopied by festoon lighting providing an amazing space for people to relax, have fun and socialise.

“The Nambour Library children’s program will begin at 2pm with a Christmas Storytime for pre-schoolers, followed by a children’s scavenger hunt to find Christmas goodies hidden in the library. Registration is required via the Libraries [website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;prior to the event.

“Upstairs in the newly refurbished Heritage Library we are looking for local sleuths to uncover the hidden mysteries in local photographs through the decades. This event is free and open to all members of the community.

“The main entertainment in the forecourt will kick off at 5pm with live music by indie-pop singer *Darcy Kate*, followed by folklore duo *Day of Embers*, and to close out the night, gypsy-punk band *All Strings Attached*.

“Gathered Folk will be running creative workshops between 4-6pm, including donut decorating and Christmas clay ornament decorating. Skillz FJ will be running a Pacific weaving workshop – you can attend both workshops by donation. There will also be free face painting and a circus entertainer.

“Delicious locally made wood fired pizza will be available by ‘Mobile Pizza’ food truck. Tram Co. will provide a licensed bar pouring ales produced by Sunshine Coast brewers including Sunshine and Sons, Diablo and Stalwart Craft Brewers.

“Nambour Forecourt Live! aims to support local businesses and creatives. I encourage the Nambour community and the wider Sunshine Coast to come on down to support a plethora of local businesses who are the backbone of our community.”
