Local residents looking to reboot their fitness goals and make a positive difference to their health and wellbeing have come out in force this week with the start of [Healthy Sunshine Coast](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast)
&#x20;for 2021.

It’s the perfect time for people to *choose to move* as a variety of free and low cost activities roll out across the Coast this month. The dynamic program will continue to grow over coming months so there will always be something new to encourage more people to get involved.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said many exciting activities were on offer for a range of fitness levels.

“People can participate in many free classes including yoga in the Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Gardens, at Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct and Buderim Town Park, plus Zumba at Kings Beach,” Cr Law said.

“There are low cost classes such as tai chi at Maroochydore, aqua fitness at Nambour Aquatic Centre, yoga and circuit in council parks and senior fitness classes in Beerwah, Mapleton and Yandina.

“One of the primary goals of our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;is to empower our community to live healthy and active lifestyles, which is what Healthy Sunshine Coast is designed to do.”

Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said he was eager to see classes start across the Sunshine Coast.

“I’m delighted to see a new program includes yoga and meditation at the Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct at the Glass House Mountains,” Cr Baberowski said.

“This will serve as such a beautiful and tranquil setting for participants to enjoy, particularly with the impressive scenic backdrop.”

Healthy Sunshine Coast service provider Taz Calandruccio, of All in One Fitness Beerwah, said the program was very beneficial for everyone participating.

“Particularly for our seniors, it’s so good for them to join in group exercise and for those who may feel a bit lonely. They get involved and end up creating a community and catch-up after class,” Mr Calandruccio said.

Yoga instructor Theresa Walker-Langley instructs the Bankfoot House Mountain Movement class and said outdoor classes in the program were an added bonus.

“We’ve got beautiful fresh air and we’re embracing nature while treating your body as well. It’s very good for you,” she said. 

Beerwah resident Leo O’Mara, 77, will be participating in the senior classes at Beerwah Community Hall.

“The comradery of the people who go is just fantastic,” Mr O’Mara said.

“They’re great instructors and help you with any moves that you do. They make sure you go at your pace and supply chairs if you want to sit down while exercising.

“I like to exercise every day and what I find is we get into social groups. We go and get a coffee afterwards and have a chat. It’s quite nice really.

“The classes are so affordable and I think people would get a lot out of it if they came along. Everyone is very friendly.”

***Take the next step***
