Works to improve traffic flow and safety at the busy Queen and Bower streets intersection in Caloundra started this month.

The intersection will be upgraded with a new signalised pedestrian crossing to help students and the school community cross Queen Street, improving safety for all pedestrians and cyclists.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the crossing would also help to relieve traffic congestion at school drop-off and pick-up times thanks to new dedicated turning lanes.

“I’m pleased council is upgrading the intersection as the safety and traffic flow improvements from this project will benefit many Caloundra residents, particularly school children – giving parents and carers ease of mind.

“The works include two new signalised pedestrian crossings and a new three-metre-wide shared pathway between Bower and Ulm streets, running adjacent to the Queen Street Service Lane.

“While car parking will be retained along the Service Lane and Queen Street, some parking areas will be reconfigured to make room for the upgrade.

“Construction started early-August and will be a combination of day and night works from Monday to Friday.

“This is necessary to minimise inconvenience to the community during peak traffic periods, including Caloundra State High School pick up and drop off times.

“The project team will continue to keep the local school community, businesses and residents updated as the project progresses.

“We thank our community in advance for your patience and understanding while we deliver these critical improvements.”
