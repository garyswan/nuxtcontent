Eumundi's main thoroughfare is headed for a vibrant improvement thanks to community feedback.

The Eumundi Placemaking Project aims to celebrate the town's rich heritage, character and importantly the community’s vision.

Community members attending a pop-up event to provide feedback in Eumundi.

Council is committed to undertaking thorough community engagement for this project while also keeping our community and staff safe – our highest priority.

Due to the current Covid-19 health risks, the scheduled community consultation will be postponed until February. This will ensure we receive as much feedback as possible.

Keep an eye on Council's [Have Your Say Website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/eumundi-placemaking)
&#x20;and further details will be advertised closer to the time.

If you have any queries about the project, you can email the project team at placemaking\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au
