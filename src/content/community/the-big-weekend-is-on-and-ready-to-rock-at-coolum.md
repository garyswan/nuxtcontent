Founding member and former lead guitarist, songwriter and vocalist of Sunshine Coast punk rock band The Chats, Josh Price, aka “Pricey”, has embarked on a solo venture and is set to entertain the Sunshine Coast at the Coolum Civic Centre on April 30.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said council had recently welcomed back Coolum Civic Centre management and was looking forward to activating the centre with this highly anticipated live music event.

“The Coolum Civic Centre offers an ideal community space to support events such as *The Big Weekend*,” Cr Suarez said.

“We know the Sunshine Coast community loves coming together for music, and council is looking forward to programming more amazing performances that shine a spotlight on local talent this year.”

Pricey said he was excited to host *The Big Weekend* and play rock'n'roll shows as well as creating an opportunity to showcase incredible next generation talent within the Australian music scene.

“It has always been a dream of mine to put on live rock'n'roll shows and support my fellow artists so I thought what better way to do that than by putting on my very own festival\_,\_” Pricey said.

*The Big Weekend* was created by an artist for the artists; and it is ready to rock some of Australia’s finest up-and-coming artists including Sunshine Coast favourites Jarvis Hopper and Ben Myers.

“*The Big Weekend* came about when I recently formed my new (self-titled) band Pricey, starting at the bottom again and working our way up the ladder that never ends,” he said.

“It made me appreciate how lucky I am to have had my experience and how hard it can be for artists to achieve their goals.

“I wanted to create opportunities in a positive space on a platform where artists and punters can come together to support live music, enjoy themselves and appreciate the greatest thing that life has to offer, rock'n'roll.”

*The Big Weekend* will host an epic line-up of next generation talent who will come together for a weekend of good times in three locations in South East Queensland.

The Coolum Civic Centre will utilise the large multi-functional event and performance space to host *The Big Weekend* on Saturday, April 30.

**Location:** Coolum Civic Centre, Park Street Coolum
