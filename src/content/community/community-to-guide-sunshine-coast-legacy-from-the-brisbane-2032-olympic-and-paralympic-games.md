The starting gun has fired, and the Sunshine Coast community is being asked to consider nominating for a committee that will help shape the Sunshine Coast’s legacy plan as a key delivery partner in the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was establishing a Sunshine Coast Legacy Plan Community Reference Group that would inform and guide the identification of the key priorities and opportunities that the region should pursue to ensure it was well positioned to secure the 10+10+ legacy intent of the Games.

“Our Sunshine Coast residents love their sport and there is incredible enthusiasm and excitement that Olympic and Paralympic Games events are proposed to be staged across our region in 2032,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our region has an opportunity to create a lasting legacy that will benefit our community for decades and we want to harness the enthusiasm with community input into preparing our Legacy Plan.”

Australian wheelchair basketball player, two-time Paralympian and University of the Sunshine Coast Public Health Lecturer Dr Bridie Kean will chair the Community Reference Group.

Dr Kean thanked council for providing the community with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to influence the outcomes the region will pursue from being part of the world’s biggest event.

“The Community Reference Group will create a powerful voice for our region to make sure we harness input from a wide range of spokespeople and capture the ideas that will set us up for the future,” Dr Kean said.

“Our region is home to a diverse, talented and energised community and we want everyone to have an opportunity to help shape our legacy.

“I’m honoured to be asked to undertake this role and very excited at the prospect of delivering first class outcomes for our community.”

The Community Reference Group will comprise up to 13 members drawn from the following areas of interest:

*   Two Traditional Owner representatives 
*   Olympians / Paralympians
*   Environment and sustainability
*   Business and industry
*   Tourism
*   Community sector
*   Arts and Culture
*   Sport and active recreation
*   People with a Disability
*   Young people
*   Education and research sector.

Anyone interested in being considered for one of these roles will be able to respond to an expression of interest which will be released next week.
