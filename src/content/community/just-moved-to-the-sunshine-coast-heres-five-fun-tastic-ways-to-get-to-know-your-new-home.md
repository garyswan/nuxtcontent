So, you’ve made the move to our beautiful Sunshine Coast. Welcome! We’re excited to have you here and hope you make the most of all our healthy, smart and creative community has to offer.

To help you settle in, we at Sunshine Coast Council have pulled together a helpful e-guide.

It includes a welcome from Mayor Mark Jamieson, handy information about council services and how to contact council, important non-council services you’ll need to know about and a detailed guide to disasters and emergencies.

Oh, and did you know we offer free wi-fi services in many locations throughout the region?

Jump over to council’s website to [explore the guide](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/New-Residents)
.

Now the important stuff is out of the way, let the fun begin! We don’t mean to boast (or do we?) but one thing our region does well is events, and there are plenty of them. It’s not possible to be bored on the Sunshine Coast.

Whether you prefer an art exhibition, stepping back in time with a historical experience, flexing your muscles at a sporting competition or mingling with nature, our jam-packed [What’s On calendar](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Events)
&#x20;has something for everyone.

We take health and fitness seriously here on the Sunshine Coast and as your local council, we’re here to support you with our free and low-cost Healthy Sunshine Coast program.

It’s a fabulous way to meet new friends and explore different locations, all while improving your fitness.

Choose to move in 2021 - no experience is required, so what are you waiting for? [Check out the website now](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast)
&#x20;and invigorate your life!

OUR BEACHES AND PARKS ARE THE BEST. We unashamedly LOVE visiting our beaches and parks and know you will too.

Both our coast and hinterland boast amazing, Insta-worthy views, super cool playgrounds for the kids, paw-fect spots to take your pooch and heaps of barbecues, great for that Sunday arvo snag.

In fact, we have more than 300 barbecues, 220 beach access points, 35 dog exercise areas (fenced and unfenced), seven community gardens, 1145 parks and 350 playgrounds.

Beach go-ers must always swim between the red and yellow flags, check beach conditions before swimming and learn beach safety rules regarding rips, stingers and sun safety (remember, sun safety matters no matter where you go outdoors).
