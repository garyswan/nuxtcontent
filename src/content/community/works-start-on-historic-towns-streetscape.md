Woombye’s golden history will soon spring to life as streetscape works get underway along Blackall Street.

The historic town’s country charm will flourish as construction delivers on the community’s vision for an attractive and vibrant township.  

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston thanked the community for its ongoing support and willingness to create a place that would be a source of great pride and share Woombye’s remarkable story.

“The community has been on a journey with our Placemaking and Design team, and now will see their feedback breaking ground later this month (October 2022),” Cr Johnston said.

“Since November 2020 extensive community engagement has informed the streetscape design to boost Blackall Street.

“The placemaking team had many conversations, town meetings, and received almost 500 surveys from the community which helped shape and refine the design.

“Shady street trees and garden beds will be planted to cool the footpath, beautify and extend the green, leafy look and feel, to the west of the town centre.”

Cr Johnston said that once works were completed mid-next year, the community would be able to enjoy a central space to gather in front of the School of Arts Hall.

“Locals and visitors will enjoy outdoor dining to support businesses along the western end of the street and utilise the new seating areas and streetscape amenities such as bins, lighting, a drinking fountain and shady street trees throughout,’’ Cr Johnston said.

“The works will also highlight a pedestrian-friendly street by improving footpaths and crossings, making it easier to cross the street, slowing traffic and improving access for all abilities.

“We decided to undertake the streetscape works across two phases to minimise impacts on the traders and visitors to Woombye.

“This initial phase included constructing additional car parking on Hill Street, Blackall Street and Keli Street – for which I’ve received welcome feedback from businesses and community members.”

Member for Nicklin Rob Skelton said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to support the Woombye streetscape with $500,000 in South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program funding.

“The South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program supports councils across SEQ with job-creating infrastructure projects,” Mr Skelton said.

“The streetscape works will make the already great lifestyle of locals here in Woombye even better and help attract visitors to this beautiful part of the region.

“Through the program, we’ve delivered $9 million to Sunshine Coast Regional Council to deliver 16 community infrastructure projects.

“These projects have already supported or created 63 good local jobs, with many more to come, which is a fantastic result for the local economy and for local families.”

Sunshine Coast Council is collaborating with Woombye Community and Business Association to embed the heritage trail into the significant streetscape project.

Woombye Community and Business Association Vice President Grant Palethorpe said the Woombye community was very proud of their heritage and looked forward to it being immortalised in the streetscape.

“In 2018, Woombye celebrated 150 years since the first Cobb & Co coach commenced the Brisbane to Gympie journey,” Mr Palethorpe said.

“The coach would stop overnight at Cobb’s Camp, now the town of Woombye, and was instrumental in establishing the hinterland township.

“Soon after this milestone celebration, a regular gathering of passionate locals met at the Woombye Bowls Club. It was informal, and allowed them to reminisce, share stories and photos.

“These gatherings led to the heritage group being formalised under the banner of the Woombye Community and Business Association.

“With the support of council and our dedicated members including Margaret Woodrow, Lyn Walker, Tess Martin and Judith Bandidt, the first of two publications celebrating Woombye’s Heritage Trail was launched.

“There’s been great interest in the book. Residents and visitors have expressed their delight to explore the trail and learn more about the important heritage sites around our township.

“We’re excited to see the Heritage Trail incorporated into the Blackall Streetscape for future generations to enjoy - and build upon our town’s enchanting narrative.”

To minimise disruption to businesses and traders, construction will pause from 22 December 2022 and resume 16 January 2023. Construction is expected to be completed by May, weather and site conditions dependent.   

This project is proudly funded by the Queensland Government’s South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program, in association with Council.
