Most Sunshine Coast households have a pet in the family – many with more than one!

But knowing the Do’s and Don'ts of how to care for your pets - at home and out in the community - can be a challenge.

Council is here to help!

Meet our Responsible Pet Ownership crew in a park near you. They’ll be setting up a pop-up marquee or the beach buggy to provide information about responsible pet ownership.

You can also pick up some freebies for your dog, or activities for the kids too!

#### Head along to get information on:

*   where you can exercise your dog
*   looking after your cats
*   keeping your pets and wildlife safe
*   sharing and respecting the space with other users
*   registration and microchipping
*   dog waste #bagitandbinit
*   barking dog concerns
*   our education programs.
