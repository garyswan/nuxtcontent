Continuity and an eye to the future underpin the decision by Sunshine Coast Council in relation to recent appointments to the Board of SunCentral Maroochydore Pty Ltd.

SunCentral was originally established by Council in early 2015 to oversee the development of the new Maroochydore City Centre on Council’s behalf.

At its meeting on 29 April 2021, Council endorsed the reappointment of Morgan Parker, Alison Quinn and Paul McLean as Directors of SunCentral for a further two years from 1 May 2021.

Council also confirmed its support to the Board for the election of Morgan Parker to be the new Chairperson through to 31 October 2021, following the decision of Dr Doug McTaggart not to seek renewal of his term as Chairperson, which concludes on 30 April 2021.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said Mr Parker, Ms Quinn and Mr McLean – along with continuing director Mr Peter Sherrie - will provide excellent stewardship to move SunCentral into its next phase of operations.

“In November last year, our Council made a significant decision that will take the Maroochydore City Centre project forward under a partnership arrangement between Council, SunCentral and one of the nation’s leading urban developers, Walker Corporation,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“SunCentral will play a key role as we build our partnership with Walker Corporation and I look forward to working with the board on this journey ahead in creating an outstanding city centre of which every Sunshine Coast resident can rightly be proud.

“I also want to congratulate Morgan Parker on his nomination to take on the role of Chairperson. 

“With his extensive background and experience in major mixed-use development consortiums internationally, as well as considerable board governance experience, Mr Parker will expertly guide SunCentral into this new era with our development partner.”

Mayor Jamieson also acknowledged and thanked Dr McTaggart for the careful, determined and insightful leadership demonstrated over the last six years as the SunCentral Chairperson.

“Doug McTaggart leaves an extraordinary legacy for this project and for our region,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Over the last six years, Dr McTaggart has steadfastly led the Maroochydore City Centre development – and has done so in a way that has not sought acclaim but with a keen eye on opportunity, diligence, professional integrity and an exceptional commitment to good governance.

“Under Dr McTaggart’s careful eye, the former Horton Park golf course has transformed to developed lots and new buildings.

“During his six years at the helm, Dr McTaggart oversaw the delivery of almost $50 million in high quality public infrastructure including roads, pathways and the first park in the development, Foundation Square.

“The City Centre is coming out of the ground and is “open for business”.

“With his characteristic understatement and determined approach, Dr McTaggart oversaw the comprehensive process that secured the development agreement we have today with one of Australia’s largest diversified property groups, Walker Corporation.”

“I want to place on record our Council’s gratitude and appreciation to Dr McTaggart and extend to him our very best wishes for what lies ahead.”
