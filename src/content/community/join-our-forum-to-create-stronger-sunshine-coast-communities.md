Community members of all ages and backgrounds are invited to attend the Stronger Together Forum and help shape a renewed Community Strategy Action Plan for 2024 -2029.

In 2019, Council adopted the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/regional-strategies/sunshine-coast-community-strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;and the supporting [Community Strategy Action Plan 2019-2024](https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/c631baf8-1b46-001f-580c-d0001b68b4a8/e784835d-270a-46ad-9cdb-0ac1cbc424f7/FE3F9B99-761A-4948-93C9-D3D84FFF03D1)
&#x20;which set out how council and our community would work together to achieve our shared goal of a ‘strong community’.

Challenges and opportunities in our community inevitably shift and change over time. The action plan is now due for a review and refresh, to reflect current community priorities.

The forum will be held at Meridan Community Centre on Tuesday, May 16 from 9am – 4pm and anyone wishing to attend is asked to register on council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stronger-together)
.  

### Registration will remain open until April 20. Places are limited, so get in quick to secure your spot!

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said since the development of the last plan, in 2019, the community had changed due to COVID-19, a growing population, extreme weather events and, more recently, cost of living pressures.

“It is important for people to get involved and share their experiences, insights, and ideas on what needs to be done to build strong and thriving communities,” Cr Law said.

“We are seeking a diverse representation at the forum and want to hear from residents, business owners and people involved in local community groups and services.

“Your participation and input will contribute to a renewed Community Strategy Action Plan for 2024-2029 that reflects and responds to the needs and priorities of our community.”

The Community Strategy and its implementation is underpinned by shared responsibility. The Community Strategy Leadership Group is a key partner in the Community Strategy Action Plan review and will co-host the Stronger Together Forum.

The Community Strategy Leadership Group supports, leads and guides the delivery of the Community Strategy. Members include representatives from government agencies, community groups, service providers and residents who have a focus on providing local, social and community services and outcomes.

Community Strategy Leadership Group

Leadership group member Phil Smith has lived on the Sunshine Coast for 31 years and has had the privilege of being active across a range of community organisations in that time.

“Community” is an incredibly fluid and dynamic organism, especially here on the Coast where change demands constant community engagement and response,” Mr Smith said

“Lifting your gaze and meeting with and learning what others are doing in community is incredibly energising.

“It sparks new ways of thinking about our community and the amazing knowledge and opportunities that can remain hidden.

“That’s why I’ll be attending the Stronger Together Forum.”

### If you are unable to attend the forum, you can still get involved by:

*   Completing the online engagement activities
*   Using the conversation toolkit to host a discussion with your social groups, neighbours, or interested people in your local area.

Visit council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;for more information and to get involved. The feedback period will remain open until 30 May 2023.

This is the first stage of community engagement. Draft action plan priorities will be created and made available to all community members to review and provide feedback on later this year. Be sure to keep up to date on council’s [Have Your Say website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

### The purpose of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/regional-strategies/sunshine-coast-community-strategy-2019-to-2041)
 is to achieve five outcomes:

1.  Empower the community to live healthy and active lifestyles
2.  Ensure community places and spaces are vibrant, inclusive, accessible, adaptable, and meet the needs of people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds
3.  Strengthen connection, inclusion, and opportunity for all people in the community
4.  Build capacity within communities to be connected, resilient and to respond to local issues
5.  Nurture creative and innovative approaches to building a strong community.
