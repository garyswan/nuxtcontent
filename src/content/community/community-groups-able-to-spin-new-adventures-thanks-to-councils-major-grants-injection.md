In a major boost to local not-for-profit community groups, Sunshine Coast Council has this month announced more than $604,000 will support 84 local projects in its latest Major Grants round.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was excited to see a variety of projects receive funding that would allow them to get started.

“It’s great to see so many Sunshine Coast community groups receive funding to deliver one-off projects, events and activities which benefit the entire region,” Cr Law said.

“Don’t forget there’s still time to apply for a Minor Grant and you have the rest of this month to get your applications in.”

Caloundra based Cycling Without Age received more than $7000 to purchase a trailer for their all-accessible trishaw and to improve the group’s ability to take older people in wheelchairs on cycling adventures.

Cycling Without Age Sunshine Coast volunteer Shirley Holloway said she was thrilled the group had been awarded a Major Grant.

“This is absolutely amazing. We have a waitlist of people who are wheelchair users that can come out and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine and tell stories,” Ms Holloway said.

“This means so much and means we can take our wheelchair accessible bike with us (through a new trailer). I have a special place in my heart for aged care residents who rely on staff to move them around.

“We do six community rides a week at Golden Beach, Happy Valley, Lake Kawana, La Balsa Park, Ben Bennett bushland and Kawana Forest. People can ring up and book and say ‘I want to bring my grandma or grandpa’, and we also have aged care residents that bus down.

“One lady, Rita, is 102 years old and she loves going out for a ride. There was one point during COVID where she hadn’t been outside her house for three months. On her first ride she lit up and talked the whole way.”

Anywhere Festival Founder Paul Osuch said Council’s $15,000 Major Grant made it possible for the festival to shine on the Sunshine Coast and support local independent performance artists to present work anywhere.

In May locals and visitors experience performances from poetry in lighthouses to theatre on golf courses and dance on beaches.

“It also provides a way for local performance makers to connect up with other artists, audiences and businesses locally and beyond the Sunshine Coast,” Mr Osuch said.

Other successful grant applicants under the Community Facilities category included the Sunshine Coast Shooting Club, which received $30,000 towards an upgraded shooting range, Palmwoods Tennis Club, which received $10,000 towards installation of LED court lighting, Windansea Boardriders Club, which received $30,000 towards a new clubhouse, and Maleny Community Centre, which received $9155 towards the replacement of stairs and handrails.

Major Grants support community groups with project funding up to $15,000 (and up to $30,000 for infrastructure projects only), and Minor Grants support community groups with project funding up to $2,000.
