Share food that unites the world, play the globally loved sport of soccer (football) and enjoy a diverse cultural feast of music, dance and art as part of a unique celebration that brings our communities together.

Sunshine Coast’s multiculturalism will be showcased under the theme *Everyone Belongs* during Harmony Week, which runs from March 20 to 26.

March 21 is the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination – a special day in Harmony Week.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law invited everyone to experience, explore and appreciate the Sunshine Coast’s wealth of cultural, faith, linguistic and ethnic diversity this Harmony Week.

“Council has partnered with the Nambour Community Centre and the Sunshine Coast Multicultural Network to support a number of cultural groups and community organisations to host activities and events,’’ Cr Law said

“I encourage everyone to come along and celebrate Harmony Week.”

Sunshine Coast residents and visitors will be able to take part in a wonderful array of free events, including workshops, concerts, food adventures, sport and art experiences, held by local community organisations

### These include:

*   **Nambour Forecourt Live!** - Live music, workshops, cultural activities and food stalls to celebrate Harmony Week.
*   **MultiCulti Cup** - Soccer is a globally loved sport. Gather your culturally diverse mixed teams (male and female) for a carnival of mini matches, food and music to celebrate each other just as much as the game.
*   **Hawaiian and Polynesian Show** - Begins with an ancient style hula performance and chant followed by an explanation of the movements and hula lesson that teach you to 'sign' with the hands while dancing.       
*   **Active Bystander Training to Prevent Racism** - Increase your understanding of the causes and impacts of racism. Understand how to support people confronted with racism and how to challenge attitudes and behaviours that support racism.

[View the full list of Harmony Week events on council's website.](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Multicultural-Welcome-Hub/Connections-in-your-Community/Events-Activities-and-Programs/Harmony-Week)


If you can’t make an event, be sure to wear the colour orange, which is the ongoing colour chosen to represent Harmony Week. Traditionally, orange signifies social communication and meaningful conversations. It also relates to the freedom of ideas and encouragement of mutual respect.
