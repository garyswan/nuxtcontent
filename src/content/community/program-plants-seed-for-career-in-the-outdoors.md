A unique work experience program open to Sunshine Coast high school students could grow into a wonderful career.

A [five-day work experience program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Et8743S32Y)
&#x20;is open to students in Years 10, 11 and 12 looking to obtain on-the job skills and experience with the Sunshine Coast Council Parks and Gardens Branch across six fields.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said students would be provided with opportunities to experience first-hand basic technical skills within their chosen field while gaining insight into the various parks and gardens-related professions.

“If you love the outdoors and have a keen interest in caring for trees, why not try work experience in arboriculture,” Cr Suarez said.

“Have a green thumb? Or potential to grow one? Nursery operations could be the place for you.”

Students can also learn more about behind-the-scenes of running a branch through the field of administration.

#### The program allows students to gain practical experience in a parks and gardens operational environment within key career fields, including:

*   horticulture
*   arboriculture
*   turf and irrigation
*   nursery operations
*   infrastructure maintenance
*   administration

As well as developing transferable skills such as technical, communication, teamwork and an understanding how the Parks and Gardens Branch operates, students receive a certificate of completion at the end of the five-day program.

Manager Parks and Gardens Nicholas Coluccio said he was proud to be able to support students from across our region in keeping parks and gardens well-presented and safe for the community.

“Workplace health and safety plays an important role in our everyday activities,” Mr Coluccio said.

“Council values mentoring and developing confidence for participants in the work experience program.

“Participants are provided an opportunity to learn about the technical aspects of parks and gardens, and how the team play an important role in keeping our parks beautiful for generations to come.”

Shayla recently conducted work experience with the administration team and said the program allowed her to experience the diverse range of work undertaken by the department.

“I gained a wealth of first-hand knowledge and understanding of the administrative roles in the Parks and Gardens team,” Shayla said.

“The team was friendly, and the program offered a creative and supportive environment to explore various career pathways.”

Council’s work experience programs help high school students make informed decisions about their future and provide an opportunity to explore potential careers.
