Grab an extra book or check out our online resources while we add the finishing touches to our Nambour and Heritage Library refurbishment.

The Nambour Library and Heritage Library at the corner of Currie and Bury streets will be closed from Monday, October 18 until Sunday, October 24 for striking murals to be added to the inside walls.

These upgrades will tie together other library improvements, such as new furniture, shelving and layout modifications, that were completed in June 2021.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 and Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Nambour and Heritage Library refurbishment provided modern facilities for our community.

“Sunshine Coast Libraries are one of the most visible, popular and valued services council provides to our community,” Cr Law said.

“Council is committed to investing in library operations and infrastructure to ensure they remain relevant and responsive to new and existing audiences, and continue to have a positive influence on our diverse communities.  

“The revitalised libraries will better capture and celebrate Nambour’s local landscape through an updated colour palette and local imagery.

“The area’s history will also be honoured through captivating historical images from the Heritage Library’s Picture Sunshine Coast catalogue.

“During the closure, customers will be able to access newspapers or collect a pre-loved book from the red phone box in the Nambour Forecourt, outside the library entrance.

“Customers can also access library services at nearby branches or via the eLibrary 24/7 on the library website.

“Sunshine Coast Council thanks the community for their understanding during the short closure, and looks forward to welcoming customers back from Monday, October 25, 2021.”

To stay up-to-date on library news, subscribe to the library eNewsletter and follow Sunshine Coast Libraries on Facebook.

Customers will be contacted to make arrangements for reservation collection during the closure. If you are unable to collect your reservation that week, your reservation will be extended.

All loans will also be extended, so there is no need to return items while the library is closed. For all the details, visit the library website: [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
