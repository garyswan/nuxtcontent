Here’s your chance to learn “valuable industry secrets’’ and gain the essential skills you need to self-publish your story.

Join popular *4 Ingredients* co-author Rachael Bermingham for a fun and interactive workshop that could change your life.

This is part of Sunshine Coast Libraries’ annual celebration of Library Lovers Day.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said a highlight of this year’s program was the opportunity to learn from, and be motivated by, a highly successful Sunshine Coast author and publisher.

“Library members can join Ms Bermingham, one of Australia’s leading book publishers and best-selling authors, in a half-day writing workshop to discover how the production, distribution and publishing process works,’’ Cr Law said.

This Library Lovers Day you can join one of Australia’s leading book publishers, and best-selling authors in a fun and interactive 4-hour writing workshop to discover how the production, distribution and publishing process works.”

“Rachael Bermingham is currently one the highest selling self-published female authors in Australia.

“Collectively, she has sold over seven million copies of her books around the globe and publishes dozens more for budding authors.

“One of her co-written books, *4 Ingredients*, is still the highest selling self-published title of the past decade within Australia.”

Ms Bermingham said the upcoming workshop would harness her industry experience to guide new authors on the next steps to get their book out there.

“Library members will gain valuable industry secrets on editing, formatting and design to help transform their manuscript into a marketable product while avoiding some of the common and not so common mistakes many new authors make,” she said.

“The Sunshine Coast is home to an abundance of talented writers and I am looking forward to meeting and mentoring workshop participants as part of the Library Lovers Day programming.”
