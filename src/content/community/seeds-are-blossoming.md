Looking for some encourage-mint to get into gardening? Sunshine Coast Libraries new Seed Library has launched with a sustainable community collection now available at Kawana and Maleny Libraries.

New and existing library members can plant, grow, and harvest their crops and then have the option to return seeds from that plant, or donate seeds of a different variety back to the library.

The Seed Library is free to access. For more information visit [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

Come along to a Seed Saving Session to learn how to harvest your seeds. These free sessions are open to new and existing library members. Registration is essential as sessions will book out fast. Register via [council’s library website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.
