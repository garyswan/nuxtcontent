A chorus of delighted aged-care residents now regularly looks forward to hearing the Maroochy River Country Music Club’s tunes thanks to the Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Grants Program.

It comes as [applications](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Minor-Grants)
&#x20;for council’s latest round of Minor Grants are now open.

The Maroochy River Country Music Club was one of 145 council Minor Grants awarded in 2021, when it received $1188 to purchase wireless microphones.

The new wireless microphones now allow all club members to join in the entertainment safely, without concern of tripping over cables.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged other not-for-profit organisations to apply for a council Minor Grant.

“Not-for-profit organisations can apply for up to $2000 to deliver one-off projects, events and activities that provide community benefit,” Cr Law said.

“The grants program acknowledges and strengthens the valuable contribution community groups and their volunteers make towards achieving our shared vision and goal of being Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative, while also fostering a strong community.

“Thank you to all the community groups who provided feedback on the Community Grants Program last year. This feedback has led to program improvements, including simplifying the Program Guidelines and application forms, so it’s now easier to apply.”

Minor Grant applications can be submitted in one of the following six categories:

*   Community Development
*   Community Facilities
*   Creative Development
*   Cultural Heritage
*   Economic Development
*   Sport and Recreation

Applications are now open and close on 3 May 2022.

&#x20;for more information and to start an application online.

Community event grant applications for Christmas, New Year, Australia Day, ANZAC Day or Remembrance Day can be made online, year-round, for council’s [Festive and Commemorative Events Grants](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Festive-and-Commemorative-Events-Grants)
