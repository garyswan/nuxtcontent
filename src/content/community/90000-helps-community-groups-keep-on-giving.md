Sunshine Coast Council has granted 55 community groups a share in more than $90,000 thanks to its Minor Grants program which plays an integral role in supporting community groups and their projects.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said Minor Grants supported not-for-profit community organisations with one-off projects, events and activities that benefited the Sunshine Coast community.

“Not-for-profit groups are vital to building stronger communities and we acknowledge the contribution these groups and their volunteers make in our community,” Cr Law said.

“In this round, funding has been awarded for a range of activities, including community facility upgrades, equipment purchases and affordable community events, all of which help ensure community members can continue to come together.”

One community group set to benefit is the LGBTI Community Ageing Network for their upcoming event *I'm Still Standing - Stay Well, Stay Connected, Stay in Control*.

The free one-day forum aims to inform, educate, and empower members of the senior LGBTI community around the importance of keeping healthy, maintaining social connections and understanding future planning options.

Co Chair LGBTI Community Ageing Network Jenny Sargent said the group was thrilled to receive a helping hand.

“The event has been designed to connect older members of the LGTBI community with health, wellbeing and supportive services that provide guidance and assistance to the community as they age,” Ms Sargent said.

“This engaging and interactive forum will provide Sunshine Coast LGBTI seniors with information resulting in healthier and empowered individuals who are more likely to engage in society.”
