Does your community organisation need funding to help make something great happen?

Make it a reality with support from council’s Community Grants Program.

Grants up to $15,000 are now open for projects, events and activities that meet community need and provide community benefit.

Grants up to $30,000 are also available for infrastructure projects.

But don’t delay in applying as applications are closing soon.

Visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs)
&#x20;for guidelines and apply online by 30 August.
