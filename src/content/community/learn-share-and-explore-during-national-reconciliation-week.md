First Nations community meetings, a forest walk, morning tea, film screening, art exhibition, online podcasts and the Indigenous Netball Round are just some of the activities the Sunshine Coast community can join in to celebrate during [National Reconciliation Week](https://www.reconciliation.org.au/national-reconciliation-week/)
&#x20;(27 May–3 June).

This year’s theme is *More Than A Word*, and encourages people to discover that reconciliation takes action and is a journey for all Australians.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said council was proud to support many reconciliation week activities taking place across the region.

“Council has a strong and proud partnership with our First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) community and I encourage everyone to participate in these events,” Cr Law said.

“We all have a role to play in this important reconciliation journey, which at the heart of it builds on the relationships between First Nations people and the wider community.

“Council endorsed its third Reconciliation Action Plan in March, which continues to focus on strong relationships with our First Nations community while also celebrating their culture and heritage. 

“I was very pleased to see council partner with the Healing Foundation and PHN to deliver the region’s first ever First Nations Self-Determination, Representation and Wellbeing Forum in March attended by more than 200 people from a variety of community groups, universities, tourism bodies and First Nations organisations.”

On Thursday 27 May a compelling film that addresses cultural relationships and is set in the stunning Arnhem Land in the 1930s will be shown at Caloundra Cinemas (6pm for a 7pm start). This event is proudly supported by council’s Sunshine Coast Cultural Heritage Levy. A Welcome to Country will take place prior to the film. Tickets to *High Ground* are just $5 and can be purchased here: <https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/High-Ground>

Until 31 May people can view stunning First Nations artwork in the *Culture is Inclusion* exhibition. \_Culture is Inclusion\_ draws on works created by the NuunaRon Art group - First Nations artists based on the Sunshine Coast who are living with a disability. The exhibition is a partnership with the First Peoples Disability Network Australia and recognises the need for our First Nations community living with disability to have a culturally safe place to come together to connect, build resilience and address issues such as social isolation through art and yarning. Presented by Caloundra Regional Gallery at the Arts and Ecology Centre at Maroochy Bushland Gardens Tuesday to Sunday, 10am-2pm.
