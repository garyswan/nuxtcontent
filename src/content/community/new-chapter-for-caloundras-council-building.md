The City of Beaches has a new green-star rated, district level library in its sights after Sunshine Coast Council endorsed the progression of detailed design at today’s Ordinary Meeting (25 March).

The approved preliminary design pays homage to the building’s butterfly roofline, beautiful soaring ceilings and responds to its locational advantages, in particular the neighbouring green space of Bill Venardos Park.

Divisional Councillor Terry Landsberg welcomed the endorsement and said it was a step in the right direction for the Caloundra centre area by contributing to the ongoing vitality of Caloundra.

“This new district library will be a real page turner for Caloundra, residents in the south and the wider Sunshine Coast community by delivering significant social, community and economic benefits, as well as supporting educational and creative development in our region,” Cr Landsberg said. 

“Over the past year, we have completed a detailed feasibility study and preliminary design to repurpose the building into a new district library, and various community meeting spaces on levels one, two and three.

“The design features an integrated Customer Service Centre on the ground floor and council administration offices on the top floor, including offices for Divisions one, two and three Councillors.

“It’s taken years of detailed feasibility investigations to assess the requirements of upgrading the building to meet current requirements.

“Whether the building is retained by council as an administration building or repurposed for other uses, at some point it will need to undergo a major refurbishment.

“I think this is a fantastic outcome.”

The proposed District Library is part of the Caloundra Centre Activation project vision which aligns with the [Caloundra Centre Master Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Caloundra-Centre-Master-Plan)
, presented to the community and endorsed by council in 2017.

Cr Landsberg said establishing a new District Library in the heart of Caloundra’s Community and Creative Hub, would play a major role in increasing activation of the centre for both the local and broader Sunshine Coast community.

“The establishment of a new contemporary district library in the heart of the Hub will create an integrated space connecting The Events Centre, a new Caloundra Regional Gallery, and the new Town Square, through to Bulcock Beach – a place we can all come to enjoy,” he said.

Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said Caloundra Library attracted around 305,000 visitors per year making it the highest visitation rate across all eight Sunshine Coast libraries.

“In saying this, increased population from Caloundra South will amplify demand on the current library. We’ve estimated that the new District Library will service a population of at least 102,000 people by 2031, until construction of a new library at Caloundra South.

“I’m incredibly excited to see this proposal endorsed by councillors today, so we can create a welcoming design both visually and physically.

“This library will draw you off the street into an outdoor, covered extension to the building and as you step into the foyer a wonderful void opens up connecting the first and second levels of the library.

“It will offer a place for all our residents, and especially our young families and seniors, to keep abreast of new technologies and innovations.”

The detailed design will be carried out this financial year (2021/22) with funding available in the 10-year capital works program for design and delivery of the project.
