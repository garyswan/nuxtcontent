Sunshine Coast business owners and operators are invited to listen, learn, connect and grow at a major expo in Bokarina on August 23 which will help move their business into their next growth phase.

Sunshine Coast Council, the Qld Government Department of Employment, Small Business and Training (DESBT) and the Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance are inviting all 33,000 businesses from across the region to participate in the second annual [Thriving Through Change Business Expo](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/16409273-a/thriving-through-change-business-expo-2022)
.

This half-day free event features a business exhibition offering direct access to more than 35 local, state and federal government support agencies, plus all of the region's thriving Chambers of Commerce and industry groups.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said this year’s expo was a time to look forward and think business growth.

“If you’re looking for help to grow your support network, this is a fantastic event which will connect you with the region’s best and brightest business minds and support agencies,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This year’s program will be very insightful and practical for businesses.

“Exhibitors and presenters will outline their five key takeaways to give businesses real strategies, tools and resources they can implement.”

Acting Minister for Employment and Small Business Leanne Linard said the Queensland Government was proud to partner with Sunshine Coast Council and the Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance to help deliver this year’s Business Expo.

“Events like this are vital to help small business to thrive and I urge businesses in the local area to register and attend. Tapping into other experienced business minds can provide a fresh outlook, form valuable connections, and open the door to new opportunities,” Minister Linard said.

“In this year’s Budget the Queensland Government is investing more than $39 million over the next four years to help businesses reach their goals and keep improving.

“Our investment is about helping small businesses start, grow and prosper and making it easy to do business in Queensland, because without small business our local communities and our economy wouldn’t thrive.”

Among the speakers is Jetts Fitness Australia CEO Elaine Jobson, who will provide an inspirational and practical keynote address.
