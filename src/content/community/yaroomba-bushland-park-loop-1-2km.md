A surprising bushland oasis behind Point Arkwright, away from the heat and busy streets of Coolum. How cool! (Pun intended.)

**SUITABILITY**\
Suitable for walkers, prams, wheelchairs, recreational cyclists and mountain bikers.

**HIGHLIGHTS**\
Nestled in the green hills behind Point Arkwright, when you’ve had enough beach and sun, then here is a nice little 1.2km loop for you. Through wetland, rainforest, vine forest and Wallum woodlands, it’s peaceful and shady with very little traffic considering its urban surrounds.

Stick to the left-hand side of the boardwalk and follow it through to the next street and then onto the trail again.

An elevated boardwalk section makes it fine for all weather. After rain you are bound to hear the frogs in the wetland sections of the trail that bring this area to life, plus you’ll see native gingers and other plants that don’t mind wet feet.

There’s also a playground and picnic table.

It's a great option for those who want to avoid the elevation and people on Mount Coolum Track.

Expect to come across bush turkeys foraging in the scrub and cute puppies on their morning neighbourhood walk.

Take plenty of mosquito spray in the warmer months as there is a strong possibility of sand-flies and midges.

**AFTERWARDS**\
There’s great coffee available nearby on David Low, just opposite Boward Close. And the beach is accessible at the end of the street. You can head north to Point Arkwright and walk to Coolum and back (or partway) or head south along Yaroomba beach.

**HOW TO GET THERE**\
Heading north on David Low Way, past Mount Coolum, and the old Palmer Coolum restart, turn left into Warran Road and then take the second right onto Neurum road. You’ll find parking on the street.

Heading south from Coolum the turn-off to Neurum Road is approximately 2km from the Surf Club, on your right just as you take the bend at Point Arkwright.
