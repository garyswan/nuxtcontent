The sounds of the Rocket Man will echo through Nambour Town Square tomorrow (September 2) thanks to a public piano the whole community can enjoy and use.

Greg Andrew, a renowned Elton John impersonator, will tinkle the ivories from 10.30am.

Mr Andrew recently presented a full Elton John Experience dinner and show at the Nambour RSL (August 20) and is returning to the hinterland town for this special announcement.

The piano will feature artwork by local artist and Street Art Nambour Group member Ross Holloway.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said everyone was welcome to play the piano.

“It may be new for Nambour, but it’s not a new concept,” Cr Law said.

“For years, street pianos have been installed in cities across the world. It turns heads, connects people and is lovely to hear.

“The Nambour community has a cultural heart and I think they will embrace the idea and use music to make connections and conversation.

“Retro Rocks livened up the streets two weeks ago, the [Horizon Festival](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/whats-on/)
&#x20;is underway across the region with The Old Ambulance Station offering multiple visual art events, and there’s even a special workshop presented by [The Pottery Studio](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/clay-with-robert-natoli/)
.

“The new piano is a free and fun way for people to activate their community space throughout Spring.

“It offers the potential to reveal some undiscovered local talent or may serve as a place to practise for those who don’t have regular access to a piano.”

Nambour Chamber of Commerce, Nambour Tram Co., Nambour Retailers Group and Reimagine Nambour recently partnered with Sunshine Coast Council to activate Nambour and bring new life into town.  

Nambour’s Brand Ambassador Rhonda Billett said the partnership had enabled the groups to identify various concepts and ideas.

“We’ve created a top three list of things to roll out for Nambour while considering the Nambour Activation Plan as well as the current and future (proposed) planning scheme for Nambour,” Ms Billet said.

“The introduction of the Nambour Public Piano is just the beginning for Nambour CBD with further activations to come.

“Events and activations like this are a fantastic way to complement the opportunity that exists within the Special Entertainment Precinct boundaries.

“We are looking to include various events surrounding the donated public piano, as well as many other fun and exciting concepts for the town including the recent introduction of waived fees for footpath dining and Food Truck Fridays Fest over the coming months.

“The Special Entertainment Precinct in Nambour is a unique point of difference for the community and with more boutique music and arts events being introduced to the town, the adoption of the piano in the public space will enable locals to get involved and be a part of the Special Entertainment Precinct fun. 

“If things go well with the Nambour public piano, we hope to roll out more public instruments in the town and embrace the music culture in Nambour.”

The [Nambour Centre Activation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Nambour-Centre-Activation-Project)
&#x20;is focused on invigorating the major hinterland centre.

Place Activation is a key component of the project and aims to stimulate and attract consumer expenditure and private investment into Nambour, and help make Nambour a great place to live, do business, work and play.
