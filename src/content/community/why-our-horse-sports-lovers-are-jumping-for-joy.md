Saddle up Sunshine Coast showjumpers and equestrian enthusiasts, a million-dollar makeover has made our region’s largest equestrian arena the ‘mane’ event.

The Moss Day Pavilion at Nambour Showgrounds has received a refurbished equestrian arena with a new roof and structure over a first-class riding surface and new judges’ box.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said this was an exciting boost for the 14.5 hectare recreational, sporting and events facility to host more, larger and higher-level equestrian events.

“We are ‘out of the gate’ with the new upgrades which have been warmly welcomed by the region’s horse sports community,” Cr Law said.

“The upgrades focused on improving the facilities structure, which was important for the longevity of this major asset for the community.

“When it comes to competing, the all-important judges’ box was upgraded to make it more comfortable to assess competitors’ agility and performance in the area.

“Most importantly, the surface was brought up to a standard which provides support for the horse and rider as well as being shock-absorbent which allows for efficient movement – fantastic for executing flying changes, I’ve been told.

“On top of these upgrades, other works including timed irrigation, new stormwater and electrical infrastructure has been completed.  

“While these works were taking place over the past five months, the access stairs and balustrade in the JD Grimes Grandstand in the showgrounds had a terrific upgrade, important in improving safety and accessibility for visitors.”

Highly credentialled dressage coach and North Coast Active Riders Club member Arianne Nijhuis said the facility upgrade would keep the Sunshine Coast on the map for equestrian competitions.

“It really does put a smile on your face when all the facilities are good, because people from all over Australia will come here to the Sunshine Coast,” Arianne said.

“I was born with a love for horses and riding. My daughter is growing up with horses and the love for them is in her blood too.

“She gallops, trots and jumps along everywhere – even without her pony – and loves coming to the showgrounds to either free ride, pony club muster or competitions.

“It is great that Council is willing to upgrade the facilities and the indoor arena gets used lots especially during wet or hot weather.

“It is important for me that I can continue training, especially in the competition season.

“A good surface is also extremely important. There are lots of career ending injuries to horses caused by bad surfaces. The new upgraded surface feels like riding on clouds.

“Big competitions can be held here once again now we have the ground for it. 

“The judge’s box is a lovely feature for any judged equestrian sport here. It is fantastic to be able to use these facilities and it is affordable.” For more information about the Nambour Showgrounds visit Council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/living-and-community/community-facilities/nambour-showgrounds)
