If you love gritty crime stories and want to hear them from someone who faced evil at every turn, this is an event you can’t afford to miss.

Sunshine Coast residents are invited to an evening with Gary Jubelin, former top detective-turned award-winning author and host of the top-rating podcast *I Catch Killers,* also the title of his bestselling memoir.

Gary has released a new book, *Badness,* which puts under the microscope the evil he faced on a daily basis during his career as one of Australia’s most respected and decorated police homicide detectives.

The evening with Gary Jubelin will be held at Venue 114, Bokarina, on Thursday, December 8, starting at 6pm.

Gary led investigations into the disappearance of William Tyrrell; the serial killing of three Aboriginal children in Bowraville; and the brutal gangland murder of Terry Falconer.

He has since worked as a contributor on the *60 Minutes* and *Under Investigation* television programs.

SUNDAY TELEGRAPH - Pictured is Gary Jubelin at home in Erskineville today. Picture: Tim Hunter.

Deep diving into his 34-year police career, Gary said his investigations found him questioning everything he knew about evil.

“Working with crooks, cops, forensic psychologists and scientists, as well as the victims, I’ve taken another look at some of our worst crimes,” he said.

“What I’ve found has made me question everything I knew about evil, including where it comes from, what drives people to carry out acts of badness and how we can prevent them.

“The answers will surprise you.”

*Badness* is co-authored by Dan Box, a Walkley Award-winning journalist and winner of the Ned Kelly Award for True Crime for *Bowraville*.

Dan has worked for *The Australian,* London’s *Sunday Times* and currently works for the BBC.

The evening will include special guest Owen Jacques, a senior multimedia journalist with ABC Sunshine Coast.
