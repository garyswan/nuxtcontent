Did you know that more than 150 different languages are spoken on the Sunshine Coast? What better way to celebrate this diversity than at a Multicultural Morning with Sunshine Coast Libraries?

The community are invited to participate in Multicultural Queensland Month at Maroochydore Library’s free Multicultural Morning event from 10am, Wednesday August 17, 2022.
