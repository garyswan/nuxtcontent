Council adopted an up-to-date version of the Local Laws at its June 22 Ordinary Meeting that consolidated the changes into the suite of Council’s Local Laws documents.

Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said the revised local laws, which were activated and enforceable on Friday 2 June provides clarity and make life easier for Sunshine Coast residents and visitors to our region. 

“Local laws govern such things as parking, keeping animals, approvals for activities, bathing reserves and dog off-leash areas," Cr Hungerford said.

“They cover a very broad range of activities and show what you can and cannot do, to ensure everyone can enjoy our community.

“Every few years Council reviews its local laws and subordinate local laws to ensure they remain responsive and relevant to the needs of our communities.

"Our latest review of the local laws, which included a community feedback period during February and March this year, has been an opportunity to look at any issues and impacts and propose changes for improvement.

“We thank the community for their feedback during this process.”

## Local laws apply to all residents and changes endorsed at the June Ordinary Meeting of Council included:

*   tiered categories of penalties which allow flexibility of a lower cost infringement notice proportionate to the offence
*   an extraordinary building work permit for outside standard hours
*   a ‘disposal order’ (as an alternative to a destruction order) to include the ability to re-home suitable impounded dogs
*   clearer guidelines requiring cat owners to ensure their cat is secured on a lead at all times when in a public place.
*   updated maps for exclusion of dogs from specific public places, including designated areas within Muller Park at Bli Bli and Maleny Showgrounds.
*   new dog off leash areas for Flintwood Crescent Palmview, Mapleton Lilyponds, Quota Memorial Park Nambour, Baringa Forest Park, Annalise Circuit Park Nirimba, Viridian Circuit Park Birtinya and Grand Parade Parrearra
*   new minimum required standards for a dog enclosure
*   increased unauthorised disability parking penalty which aligns with State Government amendments.
