Since opening in 2012, Buderim Village Park has become a place locals and visitors gather to picnic in the open green, play ball, fly a kite, or just take in the expansive south-easterly vistas.

The highly awaited opening of the community’s revitalised green pulse has arrived with the finishing touches now completed.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was pleased to see the final stage of this project finished in time for last Sunday’s Buderim Christmas Carols event.

“What once was a vacant 3.4 hectare piece of land on the corner of Church and King streets is now an inviting recreation park that our whole community can enjoy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The new playground marks the final stage of development and our community has been involved every step of the way since council purchased the land in 2010.

“These improvements offer our community and visitors active and passive recreation places and provide all abilities access with disability parking bays, public amenities, accessible pathways, equal access furniture and a breathtaking view over the coast and hinterland.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford said the playground was great for children, from babies to primary school aged kids.  

“Big smiles, little legs and lots of laughs is what makes Buderim Village Park a must visit, any time of the year,” Cr Hungerford said.

“The new playground is now the cherry on top, offering the best vantage point of the coast from the 6.5 metres high tower.

“There’s also shade sails, a new shelter, park furniture, meandering pathways and lush landscaping.”

Buderim local Florence McGovern, aged 8, said the park was one of her favourite spots to visit.  

“I love coming to the park with my younger sister,” Florence said.

“We have so much fun running around on the grassy area. Sometimes we fly a kite when it’s windy and other times we come for barbecue picnics.

“Now it’s even better with the new playground which is rainforest themed! The tower is huge and has so many slides, swings and a seesaw.

“My favourite is the hammock and climbing nets, and there’s play equipment for younger children as well.”

Other features include sand play, tipi carousel, lorikeet springer, log climber and tunnel, which provide a variety of play experiences including climbing, swinging, rocking and hanging.

Some of the play equipment will also be accessible such as the nest seat swing which welcomes multiple users of all abilities and most ages. The new adjacent shelter also has equal access tables and barbecue facilities.

Assistant Minister for Local Government Nikki Boyd said the Palaszczuk Government was delivering for Queensland’s lifestyle.

“Queenslanders are rightly proud of our world-class lifestyle, and we’re committed to making it even better,” Ms Boyd said.

“Across our great state we’re investing in parks and public spaces, bringing tourists to the regions and making the lifestyle of locals even better.

“The South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program allows us to work with councils to make every Queenslander’s lifestyle even better.”
