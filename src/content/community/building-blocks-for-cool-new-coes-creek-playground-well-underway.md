There will be smiles of delight once the new Homestead Park playground is completed in the coming months at Coes Creek.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was thrilled to see works start on what will be a very popular playground in Nambour. 

“Council has received a number of requests and I’ve had many conversations with local residents in this growing area of Nambour for a playground at this park,” Cr Law said.

“Families can expect to see a new colourful multi-play tower positioned in the park towards the corner of Rod Smith Drive and Coes Creek Drive.

Works starting on new playground at Coes Creek.

“Along with the play tower, there will be a double swing set and multi-play rocker which will be a load of fun for the children. 

“The new sensory play equipment will be fenced to give parents ease-of-mind while little legs run wild and there’s going to be a picnic table to rest and watch the action.

“Another important aspect of this park will be the shade sails, installed to ensure sun safety and the fun continues into the warmer months.

“Outdoor parks and playgrounds like this are a huge benefit and enjoyment for our community long into the future.”

The works started early May and are expected to be completed in the coming months, weather and site conditions permitting.
