The Sunshine Coast will be a hive of activity this summer with two AFL and two NRL teams coming to town for pre-season training.

Port Adelaide Football Club is the first AFL team to arrive in early December, followed by Carlton Football Club at the end of January.

The teams will base their training camp activities from Sunshine Coast Council’s Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex.

The Brisbane Broncos will also spend a week on the Sunshine Coast for a training camp in between their two pre-season trial matches against the Gold Coast Titans and North Queensland Toyota Cowboys at Sunshine Coast Stadium in February.

Tickets for the trial games are on sale at [ticketek.com.au](https://premier.ticketek.com.au/default.aspx)
.

After the pre-season trial, the Cowboys will remain on the Coast for a training session with discussions with other NRL and AFL clubs ongoing for additional training camps.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the region had firmly established itself as an ideal destination for elite sporting clubs.

“Four teams from two different sporting codes coming to the Sunshine Coast for pre-season training was excellent to showcase the region to the rest of the world,” Cr O’Pray said. 

“The popularity of the Sunshine Coast as a location for training camps is not only a direct reflection of our quality facilities such as the Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex and Sunshine Coast Stadium, but our beautiful climate and world-class beaches.”

Open training sessions will be held at Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex on the following dates:

Port Adelaide Football Club - Friday December 16, 2022, from 8.30-11:30am

Carlton Football Club – Wednesday February 1, 2023 – from 10am\

Brisbane Broncos will also host an open training session at Sunshine Coast Stadium with details to be announced.

Keep an eye on Sunshine Coast Council or the club’s social media channels for details of sessions.
