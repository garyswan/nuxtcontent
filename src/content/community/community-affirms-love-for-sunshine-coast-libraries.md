This year’s Library Lovers Day (February 14) is all about connecting and honouring the relationship between libraries and like-minded community members, so it’s a great time to join the library.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said there was a strong and engaged library community here on the Sunshine Coast and the popularity of the service was proof of that.

“We have new members joining the Library service each month, with more than 110,000 people across the region already members,” Cr Law said.

“Our libraries offer much more than just books – they host events, run programs and provide heaps of online resources, including the eLibrary where members can borrow, download and stream books, films, magazines, music and more, all for free.

“In 2020 more than 1.8 million items were borrowed from Sunshine Coast Libraries with 5.8 million hits on our online catalogue and 2.6 million visits to the website.

“There were 1.4 million visitors through the library doors and 86,900 computer bookings.

“In addition to this the library team created 1930 programs that were attended by 85,500 people online and 42,700 at live events (prior to COVID-19).

“So it’s fair to say our Libraries are much loved by the community, you might even say they’re great match-makers because they’ll always help you find a new favourite book or the information you’re looking for!” 

Be sure to subscribe to the Libraries eNews and follow them on social media to be the first to hear about Library programs, sessions and events.

Don’t forget to download the brand-new Sunshine Coast Libraries App which allows you to access your account 24/7 to explore the catalogue, browse new releases, renew loans, reserve your favourite titles and much more.
