Connecting Ocean Street and Duporth Avenue with our new Maroochydore City Centre, advancing Mooloolaba’s foreshore transformation, and upgrading a range of parks and pathways are all featured in Sunshine Coast Council’s 2023-24 Budget.

Enjoying the investment will be residents, businesses and visitors to Division 4, which incorporates Alexandra Headland, Buddina, Maroochydore, Minyama, Mooloolaba, Parrearra and Warana.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said Council’s billion-dollar budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better, more sustainable Sunshine Coast.

“There are a range of exciting projects for our community to look forward to in this budget,” Cr Natoli said.

“This includes a $6 million investment to kick off construction of a vital link with an attractive new streetscape that will transform First Avenue, Maroochydore.

“The major streetscape upgrade will improve connections between First Avenue and the newly expanded CBD, Aerodrome Road and other areas including The Esplanade and Duporth Avenue.

“It will provide an attractive and safe environment for pedestrians and cyclists, improved and increased spaces for local businesses, help calm local traffic and deliver new trees, plants and street furniture.

“I’m also pleased to see that funds will be invested at La Balsa Park, Alan Walker Park and Point Cartwright Reserve, Buddina, as well as at Jessica Park and Outrigger Park, Minyama.

“The Sunshine Coast community will greatly benefit from upgrades to exercise equipment, new furniture and amenities, cricket pitch, barbecue area, boat ramp and a fish cleaning table.’’

Cr Natoli said the extensive upgrade of the Cotton Tree Holiday Park would continue with the delivery of a new camp kitchen, upgrade to powered tent sites and general precinct improvements.

“[The Mooloolaba Central Meeting Place](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/infrastructure-projects/mfr-project)
, a place where our community can gather, celebrate and connect with nature and each other, will also receive an investment of $7 million in 2023-24,’’ Cr Natoli said.

“The final section of the [Brisbane Road upgrade](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/council/planning-and-projects/infrastructure-projects/mooloolaba-transport-corridor-upgrade/about-mooloolaba-transport-corridor-upgrade)
&#x20;between Kyamba Court and Tuckers Creek Bridge in Mooloolaba will be progressed.

“It's also encouraging to see construction continuing on the Coastal Pathway's final section between beach accesses 229 and 233. Once completed, the pathway will connect Currimundi and Buddina.

“Safety improvements will be addressed through the design of a new raised pedestrian crossing in Bermagui Crescent, Buddina.

“A number of additional improvements will also be made in Division 4, such as stormwater upgrades in Warana, Maroochydore and Mooloolaba, an extension of the Grand Parade dog off-leash area, Parrearra and a new beach shower at beach access 154, Alexandra Headland.”

Council handed down its 2023-24 budget on June 22.
