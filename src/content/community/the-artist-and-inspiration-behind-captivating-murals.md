One of Nambour’s best kept secrets is a vibrant, 25-metre-mural that brings a Howard Street building to life.

It was created by homegrown artist Adam Lewczuk who has revealed the positive inspiration behind the captivating image

The former Nambour multidisciplinary artist focuses his work on the application of stencils, paste-ups, stickers, large-scale projections, and soundscapes while drawing inspiration from ‘70s nostalgia.

Adam Lewczuk said that a few years back he was commissioned by Sunshine Coast Council to create the 400m2 public artwork, at the rear of the Price Busters store, along the Howard Street pedestrian link adjacent the open green space.

“This mural reflected the notion of Nambour as ‘a community in motion’ – represented by the layering of time achieved using repetitive patterns of local flora and cogs to depict the essence of moving forward in a positive direction,” Adam said.

“The mural celebrates Nambour’s First Nations connection while acknowledging the region’s industrial and agricultural heritage.”

His latest achievement is a vibrant mural recently completed in the new [Quota Memorial Park playground](https://oursc.com.au/featured/spiral-into-fun-at-thrilling-hinterland-playground)
.

This is a direct extension of the repetitive patterns found in the work along Howard Street.

Adam said he was pleased to see the new playground revamped and to extend the art trail into the play area.

“Nambour is the edgy cultural hub of the Sunshine Coast and the town is full of amazing creatives and changemakers,” Adam said.

“The walls are covered in art and the town is home to the coast's best creative precinct, the Old Ambo.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio and Division 10 Councillor David Law said council recognised public art added enormous value to the cultural vitality of our community.

“It is a well-accepted principle of urban design that public art contributes to a community's identity, fosters community pride and a sense of belonging, and enhances the quality of life for its residents and visitors,” Cr Law said.
