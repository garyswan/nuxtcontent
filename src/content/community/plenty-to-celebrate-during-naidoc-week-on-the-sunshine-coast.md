From flag raising to family fun days and art exhibitions, the Sunshine Coast is set to host a range of events to celebrate NAIDOC Week 2022 ([July 3-10](https://www.naidoc.org.au/)
), and everyone is invited to join in the fun.

This year’s NAIDOC Week theme is *Get Up! Stand Up! Show Up!* which calls on our community to rally for systemic change and continue to support and secure institutional, structural, collaborative and cooperative reforms.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said NAIDOC week continued to be a highlight of the annual calendar and the 2022 program was set to be a great success.

“Sunshine Coast Council remains committed to ensuring we have strengthened working relationships with First Nations peoples and continued to advance reconciliation,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“The updated Reconciliation Action Plan highlights our continued commitment to promoting the self-determination of First Nations peoples focusing on providing equitable economic, employability and education opportunities within the organisation.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was looking forward to the range of events held across the region for NAIDOC Week.

“NAIDOC Week is a great opportunity to reflect on and celebrate First Nations culture, heritage and the First Nations community’s proud history of getting up, standing up, and showing up,” Cr Law said.

“The 2022 theme invites us to act decisively and shape a future based on justice, equity, and proper recognition of First Nations peoples.

“Council is committed to growing a strong community including long-term and meaningful engagement with Traditional Custodians and First Nations communities as part of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;and our [Corporate Plan 2021-2025](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Healthy-Smart-Creative/Our-Vision)
.”
