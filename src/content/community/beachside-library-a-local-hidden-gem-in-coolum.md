Just two minutes’ walk from the bustling cafes and restaurants of Coolum’s main street you’ll find Sunshine Coast Council’s Coolum Library branch, with more than just books on offer for locals and visitors to the area.

Nestled in Jack Morgan Park, the Coolum Library offers visitors a unique outdoor deck to read a favourite book, connect to free Wifi or to just stop and relax with a friend.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said the Coolum Library boasted a proud sense of community and had offered a welcoming environment for both locals and visitors to the Coolum area since opening more than 30 years ago.

“The local library team is always eager to have a chat about local history and showcase all Coolum Library has to offer,” Cr Suarez said. “Anyone can join the library while visiting or signup online.

“Coolum Library provides an inviting space to connect with others and provides access to a wide range of resources and programs for children and adults.

“Members can enjoy free full access to the library’s catalogue, including books, newspapers and magazines, as well as the extensive eLibrary to download eAudiobooks, eBooks and eMagazines to make the most of holiday and everyday reading.”

Loved for its extensive collection including DVDs, audiobooks and toys, Coolum Library also offers members and visitors free use of computers (bookings required), free access to the internet and pay-for-use print and scan services.
