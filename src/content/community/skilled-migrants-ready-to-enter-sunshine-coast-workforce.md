Twenty-six local people who participated in Sunshine Coast Council’s popular Migrant Work Ready and Business Ready programs have graduated and are ready to put their skills to work.

A special graduation ceremony took place at TAFE Queensland’s Mooloolaba campus today (November 11) where graduates had an opportunity to network with local businesses and use their newfound knowledge to help land a new job and launch their business ideas.

The eight-week work ready program, now in its fifth year, has helped 120 people from a multicultural background improve their prospects to find a job on the Sunshine Coast through employment-ready workshops, mentoring and networking opportunities.

The business ready program, in its second year, has helped 15 people grow their business ideas.

This year’s programs included residents who came to our Sunshine Coast from Papua New Guinea, the Middle East, China, North America, Latin America, Thailand, Taiwan, India, Vietnam, Nepal and Hungary.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson congratulated all participants for their determination and hard work.

“Today we had the opportunity to recognise the achievement of our 26 graduates, who are now ‘work ready’ and ‘business ready’ and excited to demonstrate how their knowledge, skills, culture, connections and experience can add value to economy and to our community,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our Sunshine Coast is an increasingly diverse community – one which is home to many people who enrich our culture by choosing to call this region home.

“Programs like Migrant Work Ready and Business Ready help to show businesses how to embrace diversity and inclusion, help strengthen social and economic opportunities and truly align with our vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.

“We know that many businesses across all industries have been struggling to find staff in recent times, and to them I would say, here are 26 potential employees who are ready to start.

“Many of the participants in this year’s programs brought with them an array of skills and experience in their chosen fields already.

“Key elements of this program include learning about Australian work culture, how to write a great resume, and how to make a lasting impression during an interview or networking opportunity.

“Congratulations to all our graduates on this important milestone. I wish them every success.”

Osama (Sam) Jamran migrated to the Sunshine Coast eight months ago from Saudi Arabia where he was living for three decades as an expat from Syria. The Civil Engineer said he was really thankful for the Migrant Work Ready Program.

“My wife told me about the program and I didn’t want to do it at first, but week after week the program reassured me that I made the right decision,” Mr Jamran said.

“The rich program covered everything, from local job market awareness, interview preparation, resume writing, public speech education and so much more.

“Knowledge is a precious thing, especially when coming to a new country and when you need someone to lighten the road for you. This program helped me in so many ways and gave me the knowledge I needed.

“I would absolutely recommend this program to other migrant residents in the future.”

TAFE Queensland General Manager (East Coast region) Ana Rodger said the training provider was proud to help migrants make the most of the opportunities available to them on the Sunshine Coast and beyond, by assisting the participants to build their English language skills.

“TAFE Queensland already supports migrants across the state who are new to Australia to connect with their communities through our delivery of the Adult Migrant English Program – a program funded by the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs that offers free, English language classes,” Mrs Rodger said.

“So naturally we were grateful for the opportunity to get involved and support the delivery of this valuable program.”

The Migrant Work Ready Program is just one element of council’s commitments to advance the objectives of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

Council proudly delivers the program in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council, Nambour Community Centre, Maroochydore Chamber of Commerce, TAFE Queensland, Volunteering Sunshine Coast and Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance Business Mentor Program.
