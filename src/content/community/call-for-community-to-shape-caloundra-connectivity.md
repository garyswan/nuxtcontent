Community members are being invited to join a stakeholder interest group to improve access to the Caloundra CBD.

A road extension is being delivered between Third Avenue from Arthur Street to Nicklin Way and will create a new access into the Caloundra CBD, reducing delays at the Caloundra Road/Nicklin Way roundabout.

This connection forms part of the staged Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade, (CTCU) being delivered by Transport and Main Roads (TMR) and the Sunshine Coast Council (SCC).

CTCU includes a new road connection, bike track, pedestrian pathways, lighting, and landscaping.

With early planning for the Nicklin Way/Third Avenue extension complete, anyone interested in shaping design of the connection is invited to join the project's stakeholder interest group.

Members of the group will have the opportunity to inform the detailed design, ensuring a diverse range of feedback is considered.

Options will be investigated to minimise project impacts on the community and environment wherever possible, particularly the Ben Bennett Bushland Park.

\*\*EOIs for the group are now open and can be submitted until Monday **9am on** 12 **September 2022** by visiting\*\* [**www.yoursay-projects.tmr.qld.gov.au/nicklin-way-third-avenue-extension.**](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/YdRVCWLV12t6NLq2cPcNGS?domain=yoursay-projects.tmr.qld.gov.au)

TMR and SCC are currently reviewing concept designs and calling tenders for detailed design, which is expected to be finalised late 2023.

Construction is scheduled to start in late 2023/early 2024, weather and construction conditions permitting.

Community members who are not part of the group will also be kept informed of updated designs as the project progresses.

Federal Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Minister Catherine King said: "The Australian Government committed $7 million under the Infrastructure Investment Program for the Nicklin Way-Third Avenue connection, which will deliver significant benefits to the community.

“Once complete, the new connection will provide more direct access to Caloundra and help locals get home sooner and safer."

Queensland Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said: "We are inviting nominations from residents, workers, volunteers, business owners, ratepayers, transport users, students and everyone in between to represent the diverse interests of our community.

"Knowing more about how locals use the existing spaces, such as Ben Bennett Bushland Park, and creating a shared vision for the area's future will ensure the best possible outcome to address the congestion issues around Caloundra.

"The feedback will provide improved active transport connectivity and minimise impacts on the park.

"The detailed design phase is the most effective time to establish and operate the stakeholder interest group to ensure the community's voice is heard."

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said: "I invite anyone interested in the project to view the terms of reference and consider nominating.

“This is a major transport infrastructure upgrade for our rapidly growing Caloundra community which aims to meet the current and future needs of motorists, bike riders, pedestrians and public transport users.

“The project is the next step to address significant congestion at the nearby intersection of Nicklin Way, Pelican Waters Boulevard and Caloundra Road, providing an alternative access to everything Caloundra has to offer.

"A range of valuable community feedback has already been received and is being analysed to inform the project’s detailed design and construction phases.

“Council understands the importance and value Bicentennial Park plays within our community and we are looking at ways to minimise the scale of works.

"It is important that council and TMR recognise and consider the community values and requirements when undertaking a significant project like this.

"We value the feedback provided to date and look forward to working closely with the stakeholder interest group and the wider community to take the much-needed project forward.”
