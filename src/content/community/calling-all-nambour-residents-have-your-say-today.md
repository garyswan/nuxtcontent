Get ready hinterland residents! Now is the time to share your thoughts and tell us what makes Nambour great.

This month Sunshine Coast Council will launch two community engagement programs for Nambour: the Nambour Place Score survey which kicks off on November 11, and the Nambour Community Safety survey on November 14.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said now was your chance to continue to improve our hinterland town.

“The [Nambour Community Safety online survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
, which opens this month, will be undertaken in partnership with UniSC, to better understand public perceptions of safety in the [Nambour Special Entertainment Precinct](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Developing-Your-Business/Permits-and-licences/Nambour-Special-Entertainment-Precinct)
&#x20;and broader CBD,” Cr Law said.

“The findings will be used to explore opportunities to more effectively create a welcoming and activated Nambour CBD and entertainment precinct.”

The information from the Nambour Community Safety survey is the second phase and will be used by UniSC and council to better understand perceptions of safety in Nambour. The feedback will be compared with previous research findings including actual crime and safety data (which showed that Nambour generally has a lower crime rate than many other areas) and to assist in the development of strategies to minimise crime and safety issues.

This research can enhance activation of public space, community cohesion and business confidence to strengthen connection to Nambour, the [Nambour Special Entertainment Precinct](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Developing-Your-Business/Permits-and-licences/Nambour-Special-Entertainment-Precinct)
&#x20;and broader CBD.

Dr Emily Moir, who is leading the UniSC research team, welcomed people who lived, worked, or visited Nambour regularly to complete the Nambour Community Safety online survey.

The second survey is part of the [Nambour (Namba) Place Revitalisation Project](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Major-Regional-Projects/Nambour-Centre-Activation-Project/Nambour-Place-Revitalisation-Project)
, where council will undertake important research into community perceptions of various streets within the Nambour Town Centre.  

“People are invited to visit the town centre and complete a Place Experience Assessment survey by snapping a QR code in five different streets across Nambour – Currie Street, Bury Street, Howard Street, Lowe Street and Ann Street,” Cr Law said. 

“They can also complete the Nambour Place Score survey in person until December 11. The project team will also be onsite in Nambour in late November to conduct in-person surveys with the community.

“The information will feed into previous community engagement and planning with community groups and council to outline a vision for Nambour’s future.” 

Information from this work will provide baseline data which will inform future designs and important insights on how the town centre will look and function.

By sharing ideas for improving the town centre, participants also have the chance to enter a Place Score competition and win one of five $100 online shopping vouchers (terms and conditions apply).

Nambour Place Revitalisation Project is part of the Nambour Centre Activation Project (NCAP) which is focussed on invigorating the major hinterland centre over the next 10 to 15 years.

Provide your feedback on the Place Score survey before December 11 by snapping the QR code or catch up with the project team who will be in Nambour. 

Visit council’s Have Your Say page to complete the [Nambour Community Safety survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;before November 28.
