Are you an expert in your field and have experience delivering workshops?

Sunshine Coast Libraries are putting a call out for local presenters for their contemporary Lifelong Learning workshops.

Previous popular workshops ranged from the sustainable Bees and Butterflies, Composting and Worm Farms, to craft with the Sunshine Coat Project and Handmade Cards.

Over 35,000 members attended 1,030 programs, events and workshops from June to December last year.

The 90-minute hands-on sessions take place right across the region and can be a great opportunity for local presenters to reach new audiences.

The Lifelong Learning program is based on emerging trends, customer feedback and the library collection. The program focusses on takeaway skills.

Potential presenters can submit an expression of interest via the [library website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Visit/Contact-Information)
.
