Sunshine Coast Council and Centacare are calling on the local community to stand together to mark Domestic and Family Violence (DFV) Prevention Month (May) with a candle-lighting vigil and march.

This year’s theme is *Empower Her Voice*, which calls on the community to Stop, Listen and Act.

### **STOP:** For some people home is not the safe place it should be

### **LISTEN:** Attend the Candlelight Vigil (5pm, Wednesday, May 3) or other events in May to [find out more](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/living-and-community/community-support/prevention-of-domestic-and-family-violence/supporting-prevention)


### **ACT:** Learn more, access Support or donate a phone

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Sunshine Coast continued to stand-up and support victims of domestic and family violence.

“You are not alone,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“An estimated eight million Australians have experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15\*.

“I urge our community to attend the candlelight vigil, to show their support and take a stand against violence.”

Centacare Sunshine Coast Area Manager and event organiser Adam Beck said the annual march and vigil acted as a reminder that we can all play a part in addressing gender inequality and putting an end to domestic and family violence.

“Help us to stand together as a community and *empower the voice of Sunshine Coast women* by wearing your purple ribbon, remembering and honouring the lives lost to domestic violence in the last 12 months,” Mr Beck said.

“We also hope to educate and gain a commitment from the community to help change the story for current and future generations.

### “Every person has the right to live a life free of violence and abuse - right now, home is not always a safe place for our local women and children.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said there was no place for violence on the Sunshine Coast.

“Council is committed to addressing domestic violence as a key focus area and engaging in partnership, collaboration, advocacy and direct action within our community, as a part of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
,” Cr Law said.

“This includes our partnership with Centacare to bring this vigil to the community as an opportunity to reflect and show support, as well as the DVSafe Phone Program, where residents can donate their old phones.

“I encourage our community to attend this year’s march from Maroochydore to Cotton Tree Park where a candlelight vigil will be held, to remember those who have lost their lives to domestic and family violence.”

Sunshine Coast Lightning DFV prevention Ambassador Tara Hinchliffe said she and her team were proud to be taking a stand against domestic and family violence.

“Sunshine Coast Lightning stands with the victims and against all forms of abuse,” Ms Hinchliffe said.

### “Domestic and family violence is never okay and never tolerated. Join us and show your support this May.”

Council representatives will be handing out commemorative purple ribbons for DFV Prevention Month at the Sunshine Coast Lightning vs West Coast Fever game on April 30.

Tickets are available for purchase on [Sunshine Coast Lightning’s website](http://www.sunshinecoastlightning.com.au/tickets)
.

The candlelight vigil will be held at Cotton Tree Park, The Esplanade, Maroochydore at 5.30pm. Prior to this, the community is invited to join the march to the vigil site. It starts at the corner of Cornmeal Parade and Horton Parade Maroochydore. Please gather from 4.30pm for a 5.10pm start.

Event speakers will address the issue of coercive control, the experiences of migrant women and how we can each play a part in ending domestic and family violence.

There will also be the opportunity to donate and receive an 'Empower Her Voice' t-shirt and purple ribbon at the event.

DV Safe Phone will be in attendance at the vigil and residents are encouraged to bring and donate any spare or unused phones they have lying around at home. DV Safe Phone collects, repurposes and gifts mobile phones to victims of domestic violence. These 'Safe Phones' provide a lifeline to call for help when it is needed most.
