Kick-off the new year with health in mind and register now to take part in council’s flagship community health and wellbeing program – [Healthy Sunshine Coast](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast)
.

Registration is free, but essential. Once signed up, local residents will be able to attend a range of low-cost activities around the region from January 30, 2023.

Now in its sixth year, Healthy Sunshine Coast is an affordable and holistic health and wellbeing program focusing on moving well, eating well, sleeping well, thinking well and connecting well with others.

It is all about creating a happier, healthier, more connected and resilient Sunshine Coast community.

The program aims to encourage:

*   positive mental health and resilience
*   regular physical activity
*   healthy eating
*   strong social connections
*   participation across all ages and abilities.

Once people have completed this one-off registration, they will be able to join in the range of low-cost activities on offer once finalised.

You will receive email updates on when classes begin, and information on how to book. Please note, if you have registered in the past, you will need to re-register.

Activities will be added over time, so ensure you are registered to be kept up-to-date and visit [Council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast-Activities)
