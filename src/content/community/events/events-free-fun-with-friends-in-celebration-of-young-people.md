If you are aged 12 to 25, get ready to skate, scoot, move and groove.

A range of free events and activities will be held to celebrate Youth Week, which runs from April 11 to 17.

Our younger residents are a vital part of our community and we want to acknowledge the wonderful and awesome things they contribute to the Sunshine Coast.

Supported by Sunshine Coast Council, it’s all about having fun with friends, trying something new and enjoying this year’s theme of ‘getting out there and being active’.

Activities include a scooter and skate competition and a free movie night – both at Beerwah – and shopping, dancing and playing at the Kings Beach Youth Fest.

### **Continue reading for full program**

Sunshine Coast Youth Council Member Sienna aged 19 said this year’s Youth Week would offer plenty of fun and inclusive activities.

“The Sunshine Coast Youth Council’s community engagement last year highlighted the importance of creating opportunities for youth to be more active and boost their mental health,” Sienna said.

“Activities celebrating Youth Week will be held across the Coast and will not only get you motivated and feeling your best, they also give you an opportunity to meet new people who share similar passions.

“We encourage anybody and everybody to participate in the activities across Youth Week.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said this was a time to celebrate Sunshine Coast youth and some of the amazing things they did.

“We’re celebrating young people aged 12 – 25 years and the positive contributions they make to our community,” Cr Law said.

“Council has partnered with a number of community organisations to bring a variety of Youth Week events, which I encourage all of our younger community to attend.

“Thank you to our partners IFYS for making this an amazing week.’’
