Don't miss this free opportunity to take control and turn your manuscript into a published book - without waiting for a publisher to 'find' you!

Join Bev Ryan, book coach and author of Smart Women Publish to find out how to get your words through the editing, design, print and online distribution process.

Workshops will be held throughout the region this October but spaces are limited, so book now.
