Celebrating 50 years of bringing symphonic sound to the Sunshine Coast, the Sunshine Coast Symphony Orchestra (SCSO) will once again return to [Venue 114](https://venue114.com.au/)
&#x20;with a celebratory show.

Classical music lovers will be treated to experience some of the Orchestra’s favourite pieces from Bernstein to Borodin, Tchaikovsky to Copland.

The SCSO was founded in 1972 by the late Olive Frame, a professional musician, music teacher and composer, who made her home on the Sunshine Coast. Olive founded the Sunshine Coast Music Teachers Association supporting music educators in the community.

The Orchestra, when first formed, consisted mainly of school students and a few mature players rehearsing at the Octagon Theatre, Tanawha.

Today the orchestra is thriving, with a full complement of 50 or more ex-professional and amateur players. Conducted by Adrian King, the concert features Bernstein’s West Side Story Suite, Verdi’s Grand March from Aida, Faure’s Pavane, and A Tribute to Irving Berlin, arranged by Healey.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said she was delighted to host the Sunshine Coast Symphony Orchestra as they celebrate such a significant milestone.

“This is a powerful selection of big orchestral favourites not to be missed. We always enjoy an incredible performance from the Sunshine Coast Symphony Orchestra and it will be even more special as they celebrate 50 years of rich history as an Orchestra.” Ms Thompson said.
