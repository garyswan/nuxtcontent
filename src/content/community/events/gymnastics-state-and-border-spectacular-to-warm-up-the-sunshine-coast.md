More than 1200 of Australia’s best young, elite and masters gymnasts will converge on the Sunshine Coast for a triple championship spectacular.

The ‘Women’s Artistic Gymnastics and Men’s Artistic Gymnastics Queensland Club Championships’, ‘Border Challenge’ and ‘Masters’ ‘Special Olympics Challenge’ will all be held at Caloundra Indoor Stadium from June 25-29.

Gymnastics Queensland CEO Chris Rushton said club and state spirit would be at an all-time high for the five-day event with 36 Queensland clubs flying the local flag.

“This event will see our gymnasts work in teams to be crowned best club in the state, and for our Women’s Artistic Gymnastics (WAG) gymnasts and Men’s Artistic Gymnastics (MAG) gymnasts to be named best individual gymnast in the fiercely contested border challenge,” Mr Rushton said.

“The inclusive Special Olympics Challenge will enable athletes from around Australia to showcase their dedication and love for the sport while the much-anticipated Masters competition will see past gymnasts, coaches and mature-aged athletes compete for the first time at this particular competition on the Sunshine Coast.”

With only a month to go until the Tokyo Olympic Games, the event will also provide locals with an opportunity to see high performance athletes in action, including Victorian gymnast, Tyson Bull who will represent Australia in Japan.

“Tyson will travel from the National Centre of Excellence in Canberra for the Sunshine Coast event, alongside Mitchell Morgans, Chris Remkes and James Bacueti,” Mr Rushton said.

“Tyson finished 7th on the Men’s Horizontal Bar at the FIG Artistic World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany in 2019, qualifying him for the Games.   

He and his fellow National Centre of Excellence gymnasts will be on display from 5.15pm on 25 June, performing on one to two apparatus each.

“Following a break in 2020 due to COVID-19, it’s great to have the MAG & WAG Queensland Club Championships return to the Sunshine Coast, and the opportunity to see some of our nation’s finest in action,” Mr Rushton said.

“We thank Sunshine Coast Council for its continued support of this event and gymnastics in Queensland.”

Sunshine Coast Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the council welcomed the opportunity to sponsor and host another premier gymnastics competition on the Sunshine Coast.

“This event follows the 10-day Gymnastics Queensland Extravaganza held at Caloundra Indoor Stadium last December.

“This will be a huge weekend of sport for our region, with the Women in Sport Summit, Ampol Women’s State of Origin, an Aussie Stingers Water Polo match, a Sunshine Coast Lightning game plus the Gymnastics Queensland Club Championships over the whole weekend.

“These events are fantastic for businesses and tourism operators in the region and the Championships provide locals with an opportunity to witness some of Queensland and Australia’s best gymnasts in action.”

The MAG and WAG QLD Club Championships, Special Olympics Challenge, Border Challenge & Masters will be held at Caloundra Indoor Stadium from June 25-29. Tickets start at $16.60. Visit [www.gymqld.org.au](http://www.gymqld.org.au)
