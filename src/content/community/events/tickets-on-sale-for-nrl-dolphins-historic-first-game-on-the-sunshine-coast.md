The game is part of the Dolphins’ strategy to bring NRL matches to the Sunshine Coast and continue to serve the northern corridor between Brisbane and the coastal city.

The Dolphins are already active in the area, with game development staff conducting clinics and school visits, while a Fan Day will take place on the Sunshine Coast a week prior to the game on Saturday June 17.

This will involve the entire Dolphins’ squad training at a Sunshine Coast venue, with a fan interaction to take place afterwards.

Sunshine Coast Stadium Manager Simon Ball said it would be really excited to host another NRL premiership match, and the Dolphins first Sunshine Coast game versus last year's grand finalists the Paramatta Eels.

"We've had plenty of interest already from locals and our Brisbane drive market to support the new team and it will be great for people to come up from Sydney and support their team," Mr Ball said.

Dolphins’ Chief Executive Terry Reader said the area was pivotal to the new NRL club’s focus on the community.

“We have always said that the Sunshine Coast and the norther corridor between Brisbane and the coast were very important areas of the footprint the NRL has charged us with supporting,” said Reader.

“That is why we were so keen to ensure we brought a proper NRL premiership match to the Sunshine Coast.

“We have been involved in a lot of activity on the Sunshine Coast already with our Game Development staff building a strong presence in schools and clubs in the area to ensure the game of rugby league is being supported properly.

“We want to make sure the Dolphins are a team the Sunshine Coast is proud to call their own.”
