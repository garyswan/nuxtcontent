Nambour Forecourt Live! is back on March 18, and this time themed around Harmony Week, celebrating our diversity with friends, family, schools, workplaces and our communities.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said inclusiveness, respect, and a sense of belonging for everyone was the feeling every Nambour Forecourt Live! event should be known for.

“This will be our third Live! event to activate the forecourt since its rejuvenation, and we are working towards them becoming monthly events in partnership with Andrea Kirwin, founder of Nambour business Peace Run Records & Agency,” Cr Law said.

“Nambour Forecourt Live! aims to support local businesses and creatives. I encourage the Nambour community and the wider Sunshine Coast to come on down to support a plethora of local businesses who are the backbone of our community.”

Event partner Andrea Kirwin said Nambour Forecourt Live is our opportunity to celebrate our vibrant community and the camaraderie of our town.

“It's an activation of the forecourt, which has been beautifully refurbished by council,” Ms Kirwin said.

“We've had some great family-friendly events so far and it's wonderful to see momentum building as we move into 2022 and people are excited to come to the next one.”

With plenty of seating, grassed areas to roll out a picnic mat and shady trees, the area is canopied by festoon lighting to provide an amazing space for people to relax, have fun and socialise.

The Nambour Library children’s program will begin at 2pm sharing songs from different countries, as well as multicultural dances, a fashion show and guest speakers from 4pm then intermittently throughout the evening. 

There will be two hours of creative workshops from 4pm, with Coco Creative weaving, and Gathered Folk Donut decorating and ornament making. The workshops are by donation and you can walk in and sign up on the day. There will also be face painting.

The main entertainment in the forecourt will kick off at 5pm with live music by the talented Hayden Hack performing his afro funk tunes, followed by the Smooth soul sounds of Kaia Kingsley and finishing with World dance group Nizami!

Food Trucks Viet Nom Nom and Matthew's Pizza will be providing delicious food for the event.

We also recommend checking out our local restaurants in the area and supporting local businesses. There will be a Licensed bar run by Tram Co. where you can purchase drink tickets and check out local brewers Sunshine and Sons, Diablo Co., Stalwarts Brewing and Morts Brewing Co. beverages which you can enjoy from 4.30-8.30pm

The Nambour Forecourt upgrade is part of the Nambour Activation Plan. Watch the community turning out to celebrate the first Nambour Forecourt Live event here: [Sunshine Coast Council’s YouTube](https://youtu.be/IhIXvb3xIks)
