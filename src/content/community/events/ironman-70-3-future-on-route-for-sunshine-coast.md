Australia’s largest and most successful middle-distance triathlon, IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast presented by The IRONMAN Group Oceania, will now enter negotiations with Sunshine Coast Council to lock in a three-year sponsorship arrangement.

Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the annual event had provided significant economic and reputational benefits for the Sunshine Coast since it launched in 2013.

“The forecast that approximately 1850 participants, 1600 from outside the region, will be attracted to each IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast event during the period 2023–2025 is a driving factor to sponsor the event,” Cr Landsberg said.

“It has the potential to provide consistency for our tourism industry which is so important to our local economy after a tumultuous couple of years.

“The direct economic benefit from an estimated 15,868 visitor nights and spend in the local economy has been conservatively estimated at $3.16 million each year.”

An independent assessment on the 2021 IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast carried out by Strategic Facts, commissioned by Tourism and Events Queensland, estimated that year’s event delivered economic benefits of $3.52 million (direct and indirect benefits) despite the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Sunshine Coast Events Board, which includes community leaders from a wide range of professions, recommended that council provide sponsorship for the 2023-2025 IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast events.

The IRONMAN Group Oceania Managing Director Geoff Meyer said the organisation looked forward to working with Sunshine Coast Council to secure sponsorship funding.

“IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast has grown to become a bucket list race for athletes from around the world and we look forward to working closely with Sunshine Coast Council to secure sponsorship funding for the event which we know has had significant positive impact on the region.”

The next two-day event is scheduled for September 10-11, 2022. Further information can be found at the event website - <https://www.ironman.com/im703-sunshine-coast>
