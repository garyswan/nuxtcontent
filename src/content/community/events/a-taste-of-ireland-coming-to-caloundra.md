A Taste of Ireland is coming to The Events Centre, Caloundra this May.

The Irish music and dance sensation will have you laughing, crying and jigging into the night with a show that has entertained thousands across the country.

This spectacular show is bringing all new sets, costumes, tunes and effects to over 90 cities and towns across Australia in 2021.

An all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza, this energetic, feel-good Irish music and dance feast will feature a company of over 20, with some of the world’s leading Irish dancers and musicians, including many world champions and stars of other well-known shows including Riverdance, Gaelforce Dance and West End’s Lord of the Dance.

“Australians have always loved the live theatre experience,” said producer and director Brent Pace.

“I have no doubt our 2021 Australian tour will provide audiences with what they have been missing this last year.”
