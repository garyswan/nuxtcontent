Want to discover how to transform an outdoor space into a lifestyle masterpiece on a grand scale? Then this rare – and free - tour is for you.

Sunshine Coast residents have been offered the chance to go behind-the-scenes and learn more about the inspiration, design and techniques involved in creating and shaping one of the region’s largest beachfront projects.

The tour of Mooloolaba’s award-winning Northern Parkland will be held on Sunday, October 23, from 9am-10am and you can secure a spot via sunshinecoastopenhouse.com.au.

The opportunity comes as the region throws open the doors to dozens of dazzling private homes, bespoke buildings, heritage treasures, and community spaces as part of this weekend’s annual Open House event.

The $16 million Northern Parkland, nestled between the Alexandra Headland and Mooloolaba Esplanade, is just one of 27 venues on show.

The hectare of multi-level beachfront parkland, complete with a 200-metre accessible boardwalk, viewing platforms, state-of-the-art playground, renewed seawall, public amenities, and community infrastructure is the recently completed first stage of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation Project.

Sunshine Coast Council’s Principal Urban Design, Jamie Franklin, said the event would provide a rare look at the technical complexities involved with the foreshore revitalisation.

“Sunshine Coast architecture and design is nationally and internationally well-regarded,” Mr Franklin said.

“The region has a unique aesthetic which is all about designing for climate and place.

“Sunshine Coast residents have a deep connection to the natural landscape, its landforms, and sense of place.

“The Mooloolaba foreshore project requires the delivery of these key principles on a broad scale, in the public realm.”

Mr Franklin said the community would have the chance to speak with council’s Design and Placemaking team to delve deeper into the architectural and landscape design, construction challenges, planning milestones, and how community input helped shape the new space.

“The project team addressed many site considerations to deliver this exciting community parkland, including detailed engineering concepts for the fully accessible boardwalk, complex hydrology considerations and careful flora and fauna management.

“Whether you’re an architectural enthusiast, design buff or just interested in learning more, this free tour is open to everyone.”

Mr Franklin acknowledged the local architects, consultants, contractors and specialists who contributed to Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland since the original concept design began, in addition to council’s internal construction teams.

Earlier this month, Mooloolaba’s Northern Parkland won [Project of the Year](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Waterfront-wonderland-celebrated-as-a-shining-example)
&#x20;at one of Queensland’s most acclaimed industry awards programs.

&#x20;was developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s $50 million Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package in association with Sunshine Coast Council.

Council is now undertaking community engagement on Stage Two of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation Project – the Central Meeting Place at the top of Brisbane Road.

The community is encouraged to provide feedback on two design concepts at [haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;by October 25.
