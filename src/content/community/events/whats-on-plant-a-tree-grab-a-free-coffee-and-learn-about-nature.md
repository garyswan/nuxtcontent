It’s almost time to pull on the gloves and dig in for a greener Sunshine Coast.

Bring your family and friends along to help plant 3000 trees and shrubs at the Doonan Planting Festival, on Sunday, July 30, 2023.

You can also enjoy free coffee, a sausage sizzle, wildlife display, live acoustic music, face painting, craft activities for all ages, information stalls and an opportunity to buy a native plant with free planting advice from Coolum Community Native Nursery.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez encouraged the community to come along to lend a hand to make a change one tree at a time.

“Each stem planted at this fun-filled National Tree Day event will help to restore the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve and provide essential homes and food for local wildlife like koalas, glossy black-cockatoos and grey-headed flying foxes,” Cr Suarez said.

“The reserve is a special place and an important coastal habitat area with vegetation that ranges from iconic coastal heath, scribbly gum forest to melaleuca wetlands.

“It’s home to more than 125 different bird and 24 different mammal species and vulnerable wallum frogs.

“Our community has helped Council restore the reserve for many years, and in the past four years alone, has planted more than 13,380 native trees, shrubs and ground covers.”

There’s no need to worry about getting a park with a free bus running from Sippy Downs, Maroochydore, Nambour and a regular shuttle bus from Peregian Springs State School – book a park and ride bus location when registering.

To redeem your free small espresso coffee, bring along your own reusable coffee cup.

Cr Suarez said no experience was required, with all equipment provided.

“A﻿ll tools, plants, gloves and guidance are provided – however please bring your own water and wear enclosed shoes and sunsafe clothing,” Cr Maria said.

“We are also hosting a second smaller community planting at our new Environment Levy-acquired Honey Farm Road Environment Reserve, Meridan Plains on Wednesday 9 August, 2023.”

“So spread the word and be a part of the positive change.

“Together, we can live in a wildlife-friendly biosphere.”
