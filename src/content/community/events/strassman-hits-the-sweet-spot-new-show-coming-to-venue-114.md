World-renowned American ventriloquist David Strassman and his band of quirky puppets have returned to their "home away from home" on the Sunshine Coast at Venue 114 with a brand new show that is leaving Australian audiences in stitches.

*The Chocolate Diet* is a hilarious look at many people's obsession with sweets and lollies.

And of course, Strassman uses his beloved puppet Ted E Bare to charter a comedic course through fad dieting.

Strassman said \_The Chocolate Diet\_ was his "funniest to date" and "choc a block with laughter".

“This show has proven to be absolutely hilarious because the subject matter – dieting and denial – are two traits that we all share on a daily basis," Strassman said.

“We're always watching our weight, what we eat, feeling great when it's healthy, guilty when it's dessert. And we're all in some state of self-denial when it comes to our self and body images.

“Dieting and denial, they go hand in hand and it's something we can all relate to which makes for a familiar and delicious comedy."

Interspersed with the Ted E Bare story are visits by Strassman’s famous entourage of characters including Chuck Wood, the insolent foul-mouthed teenager, who truly tells it like it is.

We also meet a relatively new character, Grandpa Fred E Bare, who laconically talks of his ability to get senior’s discount from the most wildest places.

Other puppets include Kevin the alien, who, while being quite sassy is revealingly wise and evaluates us as a species, noting how we all “crave content but are never content”.

The Beaver character, Sydney, talks about quitting comedy and he probably should, given the number of terrible dad jokes he tells. Each character has his own ‘song’ moment and many of the jokes have been localised or comment upon popular culture and politics.

Strassman is one of Australia’s favourite comedians, a master of his art.
