The Australian Surf Life Saving Championships kicks off on the Sunshine Coast Friday 16 April, with more than 5,900 competitors going head to head across three beaches and nine action packed days of competition.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Sunshine Coast is delighted to welcome the national championships back on our beaches again this year after an outstanding 2016 event.

“Planning and hosting this great event requires an enormous effort by many people and we are all really encouraged to see more than 5,900 competitors registered.

“This reinforces our reputation as a safe and popular destination for delivering quality events and demonstrates that athletes enjoy training and competing on our Sunshine Coast. 

“Hosting the event in 2016 was a great success and we look forward to a similar outcome from this year’s event,” Mayor Jamieson said.

The largest Surf Life Saving event in the world makes its return this year, after the 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with competitors from 315 Surf Clubs right across the country set to take part.

‘The Aussies,’ as they are affectionately known, brings together the country’s fittest surf lifesavers who have spent the summer keeping watch over our beaches and will now have the opportunity to test their rescue ready skills across the sand and the surf.

Surf Life Saving Australia CEO Adam Weir said The Aussies is the hallmark event on the surf lifesaving calendar, and one that was missed by many last year.

“There will be added enthusiasm when our Clubs reunite on the Sunshine Coast, after the event was forced to be cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2020,” Mr Weir said.

“We’re excited to be back on the Sunshine Coast this year, a region which has fostered some great Surf Life Saving talent over the years.

“The three iconic host locations will each host a unique set of events to create something for all fans. 

“Maroochydore will feature the ocean events where competitors will test their skills against the elements while Alexandra Headlands will host the iconic Surf Boats who produce thrilling competition each day. The afternoons and evenings will come alive at Mooloolaba Beach with the beach sprint and flags events, set to draw great crowds.

“I’d like to thank our partners in Tourism and Events Queensland, Sunshine Coast Regional Council, Visit Sunshine Coast and the host Surf Life Saving Clubs for their support, and look forward to seeing the action unfold over the next nine days,” Mr Weir said.

**SUPPORT & SPECTATE**

Spectators are encouraged to attend and must “check in” and maintain physical distancing requirements of 1.5m.  The check in can be done in two ways:

Spectators can go to the Accreditation Marquee located in Pierce Park Maroochydore, to register their details and for the price of a coffee ($5) receive an Accreditation Lanyard that will allow entry into the Aussies on any day and ensure event organisers can successfully contact trace people’s movements in and out of the venue.

For any single day visitors/spectators or a few hour visitors/spectators, a QR code is in place at every entry and exit point to the venue. It is a requirement that all spectators scan the QR code when entering each and every area.

To ensure a COVID Safe Event it is essential that all visitors and spectators who don’t have an accreditation lanyard take the time to scan the QR code and check in. Anyone who fails to check in via the QR code or doesn’t have an accreditation lanyard will be asked to leave the venue.

**Alternatively, a Live Stream will be available on all of SLSA’s digital channels and will cover all finals for the Youth and Open Championships, delivering seven days of Surf Sports Action. The specific live stream details will be released closer to the event.**
