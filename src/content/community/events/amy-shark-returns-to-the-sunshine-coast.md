Amy Shark is embarking on her biggest tour ever, performing at The Events Centre, Caloundra on Thursday August 11.   

Having just wrapped up her major-city arena tour, there are no signs of slowing down for Amy Shark.

The 'See U Somewhere Australia' tour is set to hit the Sunshine Coast later this year and is sure to be a sell-out.

The tour will see Amy connecting with fans in more rural, remote locales in every corner of the continent as well as Tassie with many places on the itinerary being the first time Shark will visit.

"I'm the happiest when I'm on stage performing and I can't wait to travel further into Australia where I've never been before, to explore some of these towns and meet everyone; it's going to be a fun one." - Amy Shark

Since bursting on the scene in 2016 with her emotive banger 'Adore', Amy has racked up a dazzling array of accolades including winning 8 ARIA Awards, releasing two #1 albums: 'Love Monster' in 2018 and 2021's 'Cry Forever', and amassing 800 million global streams of her music.
