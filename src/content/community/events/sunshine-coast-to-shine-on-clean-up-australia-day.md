Local residents are being urged to sign up now to join millions of volunteers around the nation for the 32nd annual Clean Up Australia Day on Sunday, March 6.

This year several Sunshine Coast community groups will be running public clean-ups including Friends of Currimundi Lake, Currimundi Catchment Care Group, Buderim Scout Group, Friends of Lake Weyba and many more.

To register, simply visit the Clean Up Australia Day website at [www.cleanup.org.au/cleanupaustraliaday](http://www.cleanup.org.au/cleanupaustraliaday)
&#x20;, select ‘join a clean-up’ and search for an event nearby by entering your postcode or suburb.

Registration is free and ensures you are covered by Clean Up Australia Day’s public liability insurance.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said Clean Up Australia Day continued to remind people of the importance of protecting our environment and safeguarding our Sunshine Coast for years to come.

“Council proudly supports the event through the [Waste 2 Resource](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Waste-and-Recycling/Recycling-and-Waste-Education/Recycling-Education-Programs)
&#x20;program, assisting groups to organise their events, and arranging collection of cleaned-up waste,” Cr Suarez said.

“Last year we saw a record number of volunteers turn out across the Sunshine Coast, with an all-time high of 1630 registered volunteers who removed a total of 207 wheelie bins of rubbish.

“Our wonderful community does an amazing job every year, helping council to achieve its vision of the Sunshine Coast being Australia’s most sustainable region, and I am looking forward to seeing the results for Clean Up Australia Day 2022.

“I would like to thank all the community groups who will be running clean-ups this year for their efforts and to our community for volunteering their time.”

“Council is proud to recognise, raise awareness for, and support the many amazing groups and individuals who lead our region’s clean-up activities, both on Clean Up Australia Day and throughout the year.

“Why not make everyday a clean-up day – whenever we are out in our beautiful environment, please safely pick up any litter.

“Even just one piece can make a difference – after all, a clean, sustainable Sunshine Coast is in our hands.”
