The Queensland Garden Expo, Queensland's premier gardening event, has opened its gates this morning (Friday 7 July), offering gardening enthusiasts the chance to gather inspiration for their own gardens, learn about new plants and gardening techniques, and get advice from the 360-plus exhibitors.

With more than seven hectares of inspiration, an incredible 50,000 plants on sale each day and Australia’s largest gardening speaker program, the Nambour Showgrounds has been transformed into a gardener’s paradise.

Event Manager Marion Beazley said among the highlights for this year’s event is the new-in 2023 Poultry Spectacular, Giant Kitchen Garden and an expert-studded speaker line up of Australia’s best gardeners.

“Garden lovers from near and far will join us for a weekend filled with spectacular garden displays, insightful speakers, and a vibrant community of like-minded gardeners,” Ms Beazley said.

“The Queensland Garden Expo brings together Australian gardening enthusiasts, professionals, and suppliers as they connect from across the Expo’s drawcards including the Australian Floral Art Association’s National Convention, which the Expo is also playing host to this year, and our first-ever Poultry Spectacular.

“The Poultry Spectacular is a competition for poultry breeders across the country to come together and benchmark their birds.

“Along with birds on display for our visitors to view, several respected judges will be speaking during the event, sharing their knowledge of all things poultry.”

Rob Leck, Chief Steward of this year’s Poultry Spectacular, said he is looking forward to sharing his passion for chickens with Expo goers.

“More Australians are keeping chickens as it allows them the benefits of having fresh eggs while enjoying chooks’ relaxing company in their own backyards,” Mr Leck said.

“Chickens can also be especially beneficial for gardeners – they help control pests by eating insects, weeds, and garden scraps and their droppings enrich backyard soil.

“When it comes to keeping chickens, there’s a lot to cover - from choosing the right breed either for egg-laying or showing, as well as other considerations like coop design, and what to feed them to keep them happy and healthy.

“A big thank you to Queensland Garden Expo for the platform to showcase our hobby in the best light – it’s very exciting to be able to connect people with pure bred poultry.”

Green thumb's delight in exploring the Queensland Garden Expo.

The Giant Kitchen Garden, which is put together each year by local volunteers from gardening and permaculture clubs across the Sunshine Coast, is also always a crowd favourite.

“This year’s Kitchen Garden is thriving thanks to the local groups and volunteers who work together to cultivate a wide variety of fresh produce,” Ms Beazley said.

“Visitors can get ideas for their own at-home veggie gardens, learn about different produce varieties, and they’ll experience firsthand how a well-designed and maintained kitchen garden can be both beautiful and productive.

“Of course, running alongside these attractions is our expert speaker line up across 100 free lectures and demonstrations on eight live speaker stages.

“On Saturday and Sunday, we also welcome Gardening Australia’s Costa Georgiadis who brings his own special brand of enthusiasm as he shares his love of community, collaboration and the power of plants!”

Other returning speakers include Sophie Thomson, Jerry Coleby-Williams and Millie Ross from ABC Gardening Australia as well as Phil Dudman, Claire Bickle, Kate Wall and the Sunshine Coast’s own celebrity chef, Matt Golinksi.

“Now in its 39th year, the event has come a long way from its roots as a modest car boot sale in 1984, now attracting close to 40,000 visitors over the three-day event,” said Ms Beazley.

“Approximately 65 per cent of visitors who attend the Expo come here from outside the region – which equates to a direct economic impact of more than $10 million to the Sunshine Coast.

“We can’t underestimate the benefit to the local community and would like to thank our sponsors for making significant regional events such as ours possible. This year we are delighted to welcome Queensland Country Bank on board as a new sponsor who not only aligns with our values, but also shares our commitment to both community and the environment.”

Plenty of plants for gardening enthusiasts to admire at the Queensland Garden Expo.

Karen O'Rourke, Southern Queensland Regional Manager at Queensland Country Bank said Queensland Country Bank is proud to be the Presenting Partner of this year’s Queensland Garden Expo as they understand the pivotal role that banks play in fostering community stability and supporting regional development through sponsorships like these.

“We believe regional communities embody the heart and soul of Australia and through our sponsorship and providing local banking services, Queensland Country Bank is helping to foster stability and economic growth in south-east regional communities,” Ms O’Rourke said.

“Furthermore, to help manage the pressure of higher living costs and to help our Members embrace more sustainable living practices, Queensland Country Bank offers products to eligible applicants wishing to make eco-friendly changes to their home (through renovations, such as installing solar) or car (by purchasing a qualifying hybrid or electric model).

“Queensland Country Bank supports the initiative and aligned values of the Expo to generate more awareness about the environment and implementing sustainable practices into everyday life.”
