A spectacular display of cultural diversity and unity will be on show across the Sunshine Coast this month as people are encouraged to get together and celebrate Harmony Week in 2021 (15-21 March).

Dance, food, culture, topical screenings, a multicultural morning tea plus a movie and photo exhibition are just some of the diverse offerings people can celebrate and join in on the festivities.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see a variety of events on offer across many areas of the Sunshine Coast.

“Every year the theme for Harmony Week is ‘Everyone Belongs’ and I hope that message is echoed across our region,” Cr Law said.

“People are encouraged to wear orange and come along and try yoga, tai chi and circuit training as part of our Healthy Sunshine Coast [program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Healthy-and-Active/Healthy-Sunshine-Coast/Special-Events)
&#x20;at the Maroochy Bushland Botanic Gardens on Saturday 20 March.

“Sunshine Coast Libraries will celebrate inclusiveness with online programs featuring interviews, free movies and books to explore diversity in Australia.

“As part of our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;a key priority is to collaborate and partner to raise understanding and awareness of the value and opportunities a diverse community brings and Harmony Week is a great example of this.”  

Nambour Community Centre Community Development Coordinator Ana Greenfield said the feeling of belonging was crucial to the social fabric of society.

“Harmony Week is a wonderful way for everyone to show compassion, learning and respect to our multi-faith community on the Sunshine Coast. It’s also a great time to celebrate cultural diversity in the workplace or with your community group,” Ms Greenfield said.

“There’s plenty for people to participate in, including a wonderful Multicultural Arts Showcase at Beerburrum and the Sunshine Coast Indian Association’s Holi Festival – a terrific traditional Indian Festival signifying the triumph of good over evil.

“It’s a wonderful week and one of our favourite celebrations.”
