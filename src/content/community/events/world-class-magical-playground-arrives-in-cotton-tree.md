The luxury travelling pavilion has graced festivals across the nation; and now, for the first time, the Wonderland Spiegeltent, has arrived on the Sunshine Coast with a program that will excite, titillate, amaze and entertain during [Horizon Festival](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/)
.

From August 26 to September 4, the Wonderland Spiegeltent will be festival central, providing a world class line up of acts as well as free daily entertainment in its gardens.

You’ll find Aussie legends like [Kate Ceberano](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/kate-ceberano/)
&#x20;and [Steven Oliver](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/steven-oliver-bigger-blacker/)
&#x20;alongside internationally renowned acts like [Circa’s Peepshow](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/circas-peepshow/)
, with lots more in between.

Kids have a program all of their own, with Spiegeltent shows and a free family program each day in the gardens.

Play School’s [Justine Clarke](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/everybody-roar-the-best-of-justine-clarke/)
, will have the kids singing and dancing to her classics and new hits, while comedy sketch show [Holy Bin Amoley!](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/holy-bin-amoley/)
&#x20;will educate, while causing side-splitting laughter.

The kids will also love [Babushka in Right to Party](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/babushka-kids-right-to-party/)
—think School of Rock meets Beastie Boys and the Spice Girls in a rebellious cabaret.

Tickets for these events are available from the on-site box office during the festival, and for those who don’t want to miss out, the full Horizon Festival program and tickets are available now at horizonfestival.com.au.

Sunshine Coast Council Arts Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said Wonderland Spiegeltent’s arrival, with its lavish billowing curtains and deep red opulence, had sent a ripple of excitement through the community.

“Horizon Festival is certainly set to provide the cultural outlet everyone has been searching for in the wake of the previous year’s COVID lock downs,” Cr Baberowski said.

“And although the festival hub is in the Cotton Tree parkland, Horizon Festival will actually span 25 event locations across the Sunshine Coast, providing an eclectic mix of live music, theatre, visual art, comedy and more which will showcase the region and its artists to best effect.

“Over 10 days and nights the fabulous line up of acts and events will also provide a much welcomed economic boost across the region.

“Hotels are booking, restaurants are filling and savvy businesses are reaping the benefits of the patrons being able to see the festival in person.”

Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold said with more than 50 free and ticketed events programmed for the festival, the line-up would appeal to art, music, theatre and comedy lovers as well as kids and families.

“Our festival program is designed to be accessible to everyone so, alongside ticketed events, priced from $10 to $60, we also have a huge program of free events,” Ms Clissold said.

“From 9am to 9pm each day, the Wonderland Spiegeltent Gardens are open to all.

“In the mornings we have [free kids and family activities](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/horizon-kids-family-hours/)
, then in the afternoon, a program of [live music](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/de-saint-the-metro-collective/)
.

“Or people can just stop by for a peep at the pavilion, grab a drink or a bite to eat and soak up the festival atmosphere.

“The program is so full we know it’s going to be a hit.

“We’re getting really excited for [Dawn Awakening](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/dawn-awakening/)
&#x20;in Coolum, which is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences that should be on everyone’s bucket list.

“The magic of watching the sunrise over the ocean as you experience that connection to country and culture is just so special and something that will always stay with you.

“[Songs of Gaia](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/songs-of-gaia/)
&#x20;is another must see.

“We’ve been [watching rehearsals](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/news/behind-the-scenes-songs-of-gaia-rehearsals/)
&#x20;and as the artists play together, you can’t take your eyes off them.

“The performance builds and builds and builds – it feels like it’s never going to stop.

“And that is what’s so enjoyable about this show (and all good music) – you don’t want it to stop.

“People seem to be loving the open-air live music series.

“Tickets for these intimate concerts, mostly in the hinterland, are flying out the door.

“Having diverse locations as well as amazing artists definitely seems to be a hit.

“I’ll give a final call out to [Eddie Ray and Silence of the Jams](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/eddie-ray-silence-of-the-jams/)
, one of our local artists.

“Eddie wowed everyone at the festival launch. His amazing voice coupled with his hilarious quirky, content is just gold.” Horizon Festival tickets and program information is available at [www.horizonfestival.com.au](http://www.horizonfestival.com.au)
