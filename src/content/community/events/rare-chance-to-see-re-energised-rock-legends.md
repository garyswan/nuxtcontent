A revived 1980s rock band is heading to the Sunshine Coast for what will be its only performance in regional Queensland.

At last, *Noiseworks* will return to the stage after 30 years as part of their aptly named *Take Me Back Tour*.

The group is dedicating the tour to their guitarist Stuart “Chet” Fraser who passed away in 2019.

In a tribute to Chet, former *Southern Sons* frontman, Jack Jones, has joined the band.

The rockers will be playing all their classic hits, including *Touch, No Lies*, *Hot Chilli Woman* and of course *Take Me Back,* alongside other fan favourites. This will be their only show in regional Queensland and for one night only.

This tour comes hot off the heels of their number one-charting hit *Heart & Soul* as the lead single from their new studio album *Evolution*, released in November 2022. The album came as a long-awaited gift to *Noiseworks* fans who had been thirsting for new music from the iconic rockers for over three decades.

Lead vocalist Jon Stevens said the band was energised and excited to return to playing live music to Australian audiences.

“Coming back after 30 years to tour together and seeing the level of excitement that we have had from our Noiseworks fans, has been a really powerful experience for us. See you on the road!” Jon Stevens said.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said she was looking forward to welcoming the band to the Sunshine Coast

“Our performance stage is purpose-built to host music gigs and we are delighted to have these Australian rock legends on that stage,” Mrs Thompson said.

“We fully expect a sell-out crowd of 1400 and the energy from our patrons combined with the powerful vocals of Jon, the musicality of the band and the tribute to “Chet” is going to make for a special night!”

**About Noiseworks**

In the 1980s *Noiseworks* roared out of our car radios and were the soundtrack to every big night. Right from the beginning they delivered consecutive rock anthems with *No Lies*, *Take Me Back*, *Hot Chilli Woman*, *Touch* and countless more. Known for their huge stage presence and big sound, *Noiseworks* were a standout Aussie rock band in the ‘80s and ‘90s.
