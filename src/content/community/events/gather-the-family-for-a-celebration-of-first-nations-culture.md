These school holidays, mark April 15 on the calendar to make sure you enjoy the free, [First Nations Family Fun Day](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/programs-and-events/first-nations-family-fun-day)
&#x20;at Bankfoot House in Glass House Mountains.

Our Kabi Kabi and Jinibara First Nations community will share their stories and culture with hands-on workshops and activities the whole family will enjoy.

Between 10am and 2pm, you’ll find weaving, ochre painting, corroboree, dance, didgeridoo playing, bush tucker, stories and games.  

And since Bankfoot House has the best views of Mt Tibrogargan, why not pack a picnic to enjoy in the spacious grounds.  Bush tucker-inspired food, drinks and coffee will also be available from the coffee and snack vans.

First Nations Family Fun Day Bankfoot House

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said the First Nations Family Fun Day would take place during the Australian Heritage Festival.

“In line with this year’s Australian Heritage Festival theme ‘Shared Stories’ we’ll be sharing the rich and diverse stories of our natural, cultural, built, and Indigenous heritage,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The precinct provides the perfect place to enjoy a journey of heritage discovery. While people are here, they can tour the old house, take in the exhibition at the modern Mary Grigor centre, take a self-guided tour through the ‘Shed’ or just enjoy the fun day.

“The first and last time we held the event was in 2019 and it was a great success. We’re looking forward to bringing the event back to Bankfoot House and making it an annual fixture on our calendar.”
