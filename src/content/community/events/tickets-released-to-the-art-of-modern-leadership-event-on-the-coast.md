From navigating the Air Force to the boardrooms of the ABC and across the globe, popular columnist and bestselling author Kirstin Ferguson will share her experience and stories with Sunshine Coast residents at a special evening event this month.

The 2023 Australia Day Honours List dynamo will share what it takes to be a great leader in work and in life at Venue 114, Bokarina, on Thursday, July 20.

The night is presented by Sunshine Coast Libraries in partnership with the Sunshine Coast Business Women’s Network, where attendees will enjoy an hour mingling before the show with live music, cash bar and light refreshments.

Kirstin is a globally recognised leadership expert, best-selling author, columnist, and company director. With more than three decades of leadership experience, she has a PhD in leadership and culture, and was the only Australian to be recognised in a recent list of the world’s top 30 leadership thinkers to watch.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said Council was proud to be able to bring this event to the community.

“Ingrid Nelson, editor of *My Weekly Preview* will lead the in-conversation event about Kirstin’s new book *Head & Heart: The Art of Modern Leadership,”* Cr Law said.

“Don’t miss out on tickets and your chance to network with other likeminded women.
