Sunshine Coast residents are invited to celebrate NAIDOC Week July 2-9.

### The region is set to host a range of events under this year’s theme *For Our Elders*.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said across every generation, First Nations Elders including Kabi Kabi peoples and Jinibara peoples had played, and continued to play, an important role and held a prominent place in our local communities and families.

“Our traditional custodians are cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, nurturers, advocates, teachers, survivors, leaders and so much more to our communities,” Mayor Jamieson said.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said NAIDOC celebrations would be held across the country to celebrate the history, culture, and achievements of First Nations peoples.

“Council, along with the local First Nations community, has a range of events and activities happening during the week including First Nations exhibitions at Caloundra Regional Gallery and Maroochydore Library, as well as weaving, children’s storytelling and a bonfire at TribalLink in Mapleton,” Cr Law said.

“Be sure to join Council’s annual flag raising ceremony on Wednesday, July 5 at 9am at Nambour Library Forecourt.

“This event showcases the Sunshine Coast First Nations community by highlighting the significance of First Nations connection to Country, their values, and their culture.”

Get your cheese boards and movie snacks ready to see the Australian film, *The Sapphires*, Saturday, July 8, at Sunshine Coast Stadium with gates opening from 5.30pm to start at 6.30pm.

You can purchase tickets on [Council’s Libraries website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/whats-on/see-the-sapphires-at-the-outdoor-cinema/)
. Tickets are $10 per person (Booking essential). Complimentary popcorn will be provided, otherwise bring your own movie snacks or purchase from the canteen.
