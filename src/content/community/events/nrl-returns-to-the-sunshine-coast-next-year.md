Footy fans are in for a treat after the 2023 National Rugby League Telstra Premiership draw was released today, with Sunshine Coast Stadium featuring in two pre-season games and two premiership matches.

Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said council and NRL relationships continued to grow the region’s position as Australia’s premier sports training and event destination.

“The pre-season matches are such a great opportunity for the Broncos, Titans and Cowboys fans to head to the Sunshine Coast for a week or long weekend of football-inspired fun,” Cr O’Pray said.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 3 Councillor Peter Cox said it was great to see Sunshine Coast Stadium play host to a raft of quality rugby league.

‘Hosting the Brisbane Broncos will be a real treat for Sunshine Coast fans in February,” Cr Cox said.

“And the returning South Sydney Rabbitohs in July are always a crowd pleaser with win after win when playing at their home-away-from-home here on the Sunshine Coast.”

The rugby league season will kick-off with the Brisbane Broncos calling the Sunshine Coast home for six super days in February.

The visit will start with a pre-season trial game against the Gold Coast Titans on Sunday February 12, followed by a week-long camp including plenty of community activation, in schools and out in the community, finishing off with their final trial against the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys on Saturday February 18.

These Queensland derbies are sure to be big games as they cement their teams in their final hit outs before the season begins.

Sunshine Coast Stadium will welcome the newest team in town, the Dolphins, to the stadium for a Round 17 clash against the Parramatta Eels on Saturday June 24.

Four weeks later on Friday July 21, South Sydney Rabbitohs are back for their fifth game at Sunshine Coast Stadium – their home-away-from-home – to take on Brisbane Broncos in Round 21.

Sunshine Coast residents can get their NRL fix right here in their backyard with some quality games coming to town in the 2023 season.

Ticketing details to be announced shortly.
