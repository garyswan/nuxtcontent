Join Australian former world champion¬†marathon¬†runner Robert de Castella for lunch this Saturday

On Saturday 13 August the Indigenous Marathon Foundation Charity lunch will be on at Alexandra Headland Surf Life Saving Club.

This charity event is part of the Sunshine Coast Marathon weekend to celebrate 40 years since Rob de Castella won gold at the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games and bring awareness to Indigenous Marathon Foundation that Rob founded to bring exposure and encourage more indigenous participation in the sport of distance running.

Alongside him on stage will be panel speakers Olympic Marathon runner Brett Robinson and Indigenous artist Ray Landers.

As well as a two-course luncheon, the event will include a Sport Memorabilia auction to raise funds for the Indigenous Marathon Foundation, hosted by Evan ‚ÄòBanger‚Äô Bancroft.

Rob de Castella produced one of Australia's most memorable Commonwealth Games Gold Medal moments in 1982.

‚ÄúIt was before the health and safety era, so I was running, and I could see this wall of people on the road up ahead, and then they‚Äôd just part like a sea as I got to them,‚Äù de Castella said. ‚ÄúIt was pretty special.‚Äù

Hear from Australia's most revered and fastest ever marathoner about his memory from the day he ran through the streets of Brisbane to produce a Commonwealth Games Gold medal-winning run now etched in folklore.

Major Medals:\
üèÖGold 1983 World Championships in Helsinki\
üèÖGold 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games\
üèÖGold 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games\
üèÜPersonal best: 2:07:51 (still Australia's fastest men's marathon)
