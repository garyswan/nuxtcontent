These school holidays get out your spy glass and step back in time to solve the clues that will uncover the life of our early settlers with Sunshine Coast Council’s Museum Mystery Madness.

Visit your local regional museum from September 1 to October 2 to test your detective skills by completing a fun-filled quiz for your chance to win a prize.

Visitors will experience a different quiz journey at each participating museum, [Bankfoot House Heritage Precinct, Buderim Pioneer Cottage, Eumundi Museum, Kenilworth Museum, Landsborough Museum and Nambour Museum.](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Programs-and-Events/Museum-Madness)


Quiz questions are unique to each museum and are linked to the exhibitions and display. The questions could be anything from follow the scrabble trail letters and answer the questions to find the name of a miniature toy on display.

During this fun and educational heritage journey, your keen observation and detective skills could pay off, with a chance to win a $100 Caloundra Regional Gallery store voucher\* a fabulous way to support local artisans.

Each entrant will receive a free pocket magnifier to help solve problems and discover the Sunshine Coast’s amazing heritage.

Visitors can enter one or all six museum quizzes and become a Museum VIP with a discount card.\
Sunshine Coast Council Acting Mayor and Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the quiz was an interactive and light-hearted way to promote Sunshine Coast museums.

"Each museum explores different heritage stories through its own remarkable, diverse and unique collection,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Each time you walk through the door, you’re bound to see something you haven’t noticed before or experience something new.

“It could be as nostalgic as a miniature toy wagon, or as intriguing as the evolution of the phone.

“No matter what it is, each display helps us understand something more about how our regional communities once lived and how we continue to pursue progress.

“Museums offer an exceptional low-cost day out, and during the school holidays the quiz offers a fun, meaningful and even more rewarding way for all ages to explore our incredible Sunshine Coast heritage.”
