Do you love science? Are you interested in helping conserve and restore our local ecosystems?

We want you to become a Citizen Scientist this summer!

By downloading the *ClimateWatch* app and walking one of our three trails spread throughout the Sunshine Coast, to help shape the country’s scientific response to climate change.

The Maroochy Wetlands, Kawana Forest & Currimundi Lake are all home to ClimateWatch trails, allowing you to hike the loops and record plant & animal species along the way!

White belly sea eagles, coastal banksia, rainbow bee-eaters, & black flying foxes are just some of the many different animals & plants you could spot and record along these trails.

It’s as easy as downloading the *ClimateWatch* app, registering yourself and taking photographs at a particular site.

For more information you can head to [ClimateWatch.org.au](https://www.climatewatch.org.au/)
&#x20;or download their app from your app store.
