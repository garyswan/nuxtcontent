Multi-platinum selling Australian music icons, The Veronicas - aka Jess and Lisa Origliasso - have announced their first national tour in six years, **GODZILLA V HUMAN** at The Events Centre, Caloundra this June.

The long-awaited **GODZILLA V HUMAN Tour** from Australia’s most successful musical duo will treat audiences to a unique experience as they’re taken aboard a flight simulation on Veronicas Airlines before the concert splits into two parts, providing a special performance that showcases the two very different sides of the sisters.

The first part, **GODZILLA,** will be a high energy introduction into the alter ego of The Veronicas. The second part, **HUMAN,** will see Lisa and Jess strip it all back to their more vulnerable singer/songwriter roots. The duality of the show promises fans uniquely intimate access into the journey of becoming one of Australia - and the world’s - most commanding pop stars.

The Veronicas are excited to be re-connecting with their fans, saying: *“Touring live is the greatest energy hit. Transforming from a dance party to emotional sing-a-longs, we’ve missed it so much. We can’t wait to be back on stage with you all again.”*

The tour will feature all the fan favourites from across The Veronicas’ catalogue including, *Hook Me Up, You Ruin Me, In My Blood, 4ever, Everything I’m Not,* as well as new music from their recent double-album release **GODZILLA v HUMAN.**
