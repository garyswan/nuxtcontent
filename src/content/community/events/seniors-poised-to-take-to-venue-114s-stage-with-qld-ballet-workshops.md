Tickets are now on sale for Sunshine Coast seniors keen to channel their inner ballerina or ballerino in a special workshop being held at Venue 114, Bokarina, during Seniors Month in October.

This year’s theme is *Social Connections* and older adults are urged to step out of their comfort zone, get out and get active on Friday 15 October.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said she was delighted to welcome Queensland Ballet back to the Sunshine Coast.

“Around the world adults of all ages are discovering what Queensland Ballet has known forever – that movement is a great way to improve poise, core strength, stamina and have a whole lot of fun,” Ms Thompson said.

“These workshops are designed to stimulate participants both physically and mentally and, importantly, they’re suitable for all levels of experience including beginners.”  

There are four different styles of ballet workshops on offer with morning or afternoon tea including fresh scones with jam and cream, tea and barista coffee also available.
