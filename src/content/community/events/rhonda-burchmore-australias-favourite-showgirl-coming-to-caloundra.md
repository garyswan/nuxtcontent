Rhonda Burchmore celebrates 40 years from stage to jungle with her dazzling new show **GLAMAZONIA** at The Events Centre, Caloundra this April.

After winning Australia’s hearts on *I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!,* Rhonda takes centre stage to share songs, stories and secrets about surviving four decades in one of the world’s most formidable industries.

From London’s West End to the depths of the South African jungle, the Glamazonia herself will exhilarate audiences on a high-octane thrill ride through forty years of entertainment.

Featuring icons of pop music, Rhonda will interpret hits like Katy Perry’s *Roar,* Helen Reddy’s *I Am Woman,* Cher’s *If I Could Turn Back Time* and Gloria Gaynor’s *I Will Survive* for a musical extravaganza unlike any other.

Rhonda’s humour and spirit will shine through as she recounts hilarious anecdotes and belts out show stopping renditions.

To delight audiences, Rhonda will be backed by a sizzling hot band plus tantalising toy boys to help her burn up the dance floor.

There will be no shortage of glamour, with glittering ensembles and gowns galore, giving audiences everything they’ve come to love and expect from this Aussie icon.

Throughout her career, Rhonda has made a distinctive impression on audiences with her dazzling dance steps, superb comic timing, effervescent personality and impressive voice; all of which will come to fruition in this latest show.

In Glamazonia, the beloved star of stage and screen sings and dances her way through tales of her illustrious career; proving why she is one of the fiercest survivors of the Australian entertainment industry.
