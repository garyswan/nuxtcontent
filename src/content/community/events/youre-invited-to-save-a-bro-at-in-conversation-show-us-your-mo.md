This International Men’s Day (November 19) Venue 114 is thrilled to launch *In Conversation: Show Us Your Mo*, an event designed to change the face of local men’s mental health and wellbeing.

Sunshine Coast men and women are invited to the afternoon gathering that aims to build awareness around mental health and suicide prevention while addressing some of the biggest health issues faced by men including prostate and testicular cancer.

Local radio presenter Sam Coward of Hot 91 will emcee an open and honest conversation with local mental health advocates Leon Stensholm (Body By Leon*)* and Sam Parker (*Grab Life By The Balls)* as they share their own personal experiences.

Held in the picturesque lakeside courtyard of Venue 114 and entertained by local musician Ollie Murk, *In Conversation: Show Us Your Mo* is a general admission standing event where everyone can come together in a relaxed and non-judgemental environment while having a beer and a laugh with their mates.

Men will have the opportunity to fundraise and grow their moustaches with Movember while guests are encouraged to enter a “Best Moustache and Movember Awareness” competition with prizes.

Photographer Megan Gill’s *Portraits of Mankind* will be on exhibition in the foyer at Venue 114 for viewing on the night and for the entirety of November, celebrating men who are advocates for change and breaking down societal stereotypes.

Your Mates Brewery will be serving beverages onsite with a first beverage included in the ticket price along with a delicious burger and fries from Chomp Burgers.

Tickets are $39+booking fee and is an 18+ event.

Venue 114 has produced the *In Conversation* Series with the vision to educate and empower the community while celebrating diversity and inclusion. Proudly supported by Channel 7, Hot 91.1 FM and *My Weekly Preview*.
