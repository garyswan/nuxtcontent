The 2022 StreetSmarts AFLQ Schools Cup champions will be crowned from tomorrow, Friday October 14th – Sunday October 16th in a three-day footy bonanza at Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex.

Since March 2022, 613 teams and more than 12,000 students from primary and secondary schools across Queensland have competed in the StreetSmarts AFLQ Schools Cup.

This weekend 30 teams across seven divisions will vie for the premiership.

Introduced in 2016, the StreetSmarts Cup is AFL Queensland’s premier schools’ competition.

The state-wide, interschool competition for boys and girls includes Primary and Secondary School teams, in addition to inclusion sides. 

Friday will see preliminary games contested before Primary Grand Finals are played on Saturday, and Secondary Grand Finals are played on Sunday.

Trisha Squires, Head of AFL Queensland, said everyone was looking forward to three days of football, while also celebrating another record-breaking year.

“We are so proud to watch this competition grow from strength to strength each year, and 2022 was no different for us, achieving a record in the number of schools participating,” she said.

“We’ve hosted StreetSmarts AFLQ Schools Cup games from Byron Bay to Cairns since March, including the recent North Queensland Championships in Townsville and now it all comes down to this weekend.

“I’d like to thank the Sunshine Coast Council for their support in sponsoring the finals this weekend and thank our wonderful principal partner of the 2022 AFLQ Schools Cup; StreetSmarts, for their ongoing support of this program.

“Thank you to all the students, teachers, parents and volunteers throughout the year who have made this carnival possible.

“Good luck to all of our remaining schools this weekend and may the best teams win.”

Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to continue supporting the competition in 2022 through the StreetSmarts program.

“Driving is a core part of our Queensland lifestyle, with our state vast as it is diverse in people and landscapes, which is why road safety is so important,” Mr Bailey said.

“In AFL every person has a role to play, and our roads are no different.

“I’m proud to continue this partnership with AFL Queensland, to support the shared message of road safety with players, friends, family and supporters.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said Sunshine Coast Council was committed to providing great opportunities for young athletes to compete and develop their skills in a safe, welcoming environment.\

Council is proud to be a major sponsor and host the StreetSmarts AFLQ Schools Cup at our Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex this year.\
 \
“A few AFLW Brisbane Lions games were played here last season and many AFL training camps over the years," Cr O’Pray said.\
 \
“Next year, the Sunshine Coast will host the 2023 AFL Masters, so it seems right to start at the grass roots level with the young ones and watch them develop." 

The StreetSmarts AFLQ Schools Cup has a proud history of nurturing and developing some of the state’s best talent including past AFLQ Schools Cup students and now Gold Coast SUNS products Serene Watson, Connor Budarick, and Alex Davies, along with Brisbane Lions AFLW Premiership player Belle Dawes.

The state finals will be livestreamed on KommunityTV, News Limited’s streaming platform, across the three days of competition.

The AFLQ Schools Cup Grand Final weekend will also provide a platform for the AFL’s new National School Strategy to be launched. Created by teachers, for teachers, this new approach aims to provide Australian educators with a suite of high-quality and curriculum aligned resources, complemented by a suite of professional learning opportunities.

Teachers will be able to access this exciting new offering on the AFL’s new bespoke schools website at [Play.AFL/schools](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/0R16Cq71oJU1WL0GtElZqu?domain=play.afl)
&#x20;from Wednesday October 19th.
