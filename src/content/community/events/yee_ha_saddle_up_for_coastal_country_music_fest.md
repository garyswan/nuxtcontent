Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Coastal Country Music Fest would be a wonderful addition to the range of events at the popular venue.

“This brand-new country music event includes some of the industry’s freshest home-grown artists who will perform right here on the Sunshine Coast for locals and visitors to enjoy at an all-weather event,” Cr Law said.

“Event goers will be treated to five powerhouse sets over the course of the afternoon and evening whilst enjoying delicious barbeque meals from local food trucks, an on-site bar, and the opportunity to meet the artists at artist signing sessions.

“Music has a way of bringing people together and Sunshine Coast locals love live music. This exciting new event will be sure to have everyone kickin’ up their heels.”
