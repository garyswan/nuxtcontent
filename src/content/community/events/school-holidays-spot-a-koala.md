Bring the family along to follow the Koala Discovery Trail to learn more about why this endangered species calls the Maroochy Bushland Botanic Gardens home.

This self-guided walk takes you on a journey through the gardens and if you are lucky, you might spot Lizzy the Koala along the trail.

Start the trail near the lagoon causeway.

WHEN: The Koala Trail will be available from early January. The gardens are open from 7am to 6pm, 7 days a week.

WHERE: Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden, 51 Palm Creek Rd, Tanawha QLD 4554.
