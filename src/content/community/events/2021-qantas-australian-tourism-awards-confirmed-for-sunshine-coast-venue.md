The Australian Tourism Industry Council (ATIC) is holding its annual 2021 Qantas Australian Tourism Awards, proudly supported by the Queensland Government, on 18 March 2022 at the Sunshine Coast Convention Centre.

The Qantas Australian Tourism Awards (QATA) celebrate the outstanding achievements of individuals and businesses across our tourism community. Following the incredible challenges, the industry has faced over the past two years, the QATA awards will bring the industry together once again to celebrate resilience, strength and inspiration.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said securing the awards was a significant coup, a joint partnership of Sunshine Coast Council, Visit Sunshine Coast and the Sunshine Coast Airport.

“Hosting these prestigious awards for the first time will be a great opportunity to showcase both our region and our ability to host a premium national quality industry events like this one.

“It’s a great opportunity to show off the Sunshine Coast which was recently crowned the most loved destination in the world, in all its glory - all of our amazing tourist attractions, the businesses, the beautiful local produce from across the region and the people within our community.

And my best wishes to Montville’s Narrows Escape Rainforest Retreat who will be competing for gold in the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards.” Mayor Jamieson said*.*

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the Queensland Government is proud to support the awards.

“Queensland is one of the world’s great tourism destinations, and the tourism industry is critical to our economy and our economic recovery,” the Premier said.

“While the industry has been challenged like never before over the past couple of years, we are looking forward to a brighter and more exciting future for the tourism sector as we get through this pandemic.

“These awards are about celebrating the amazing people behind our tourism businesses and the incredible tourism experiences they offer.”

Queensland Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said the Sunshine Coast was a natural destination for the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards.

“Queensland’s Sunshine Coast is an excellent example of regions building on traditional strengths for economic recovery,” Mr Hinchliffe said.

“The Sunshine Coast has cleverly focused its strategy on drive tourism and strong local events to encourage more visitors to stay longer.

“Congratulations to the Queensland finalists who have put tremendous effort into rebuilding better for the future.

“We know recognition at the Australian Tourism Awards inspires more holidaymakers to discover Queensland’s world-class visitor experiences.”

The event will feature with awards over 25 categories including: Australia’s best Major Attraction, best Major Event or Festival, Cultural Tourism, Hosted Accommodation and Excellence in Food Tourism among others.

ATIC’s Chair of Awards, Daniel Gschwind, said that this event is an opportunity to celebrate our strength and begin the process of renewal.

“The Qantas Australian Tourism Awards, proudly supported by the Queensland Government, are our industry’s premier event, after a long and difficult two years, we will be celebrating our achievements as a whole and begin to move forward together to renewed opportunities and growth.”

ATIC is thrilled to have the opportunity to host these awards on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, one of Australia’s top tourism destinations and a national centre for conventions and awards.

Tickets to this event are now available and we encourage you to get in early to celebrate the best that Australian tourism has to offer. Tickets and more information are available here: <https://www.qualitytourismaustralia.com/australian-tourism-awards/2021-awards/>
