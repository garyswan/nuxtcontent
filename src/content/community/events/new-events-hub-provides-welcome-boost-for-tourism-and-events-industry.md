Want to know what’s happening across the Sunshine Coast?

A free and easy-to-use online events hub is now available to residents and visitors to showcase the very best of ‘what’s on’ across the Sunshine Coast.

The new and improved [Events.SunshineCoast](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;offers all of the region’s events in one place on a standalone website.

It's easy to use and navigate and continues to promote the Sunshine Coast as a leading host of events of all types and sizes.

Sunshine Coast Economic Development Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the new platform allowed council, community interest groups, sporting groups and festival organisers to capitalise on their local events and drive community vibrancy and visitation while giving tourists even more reason to visit.

“The Sunshine Coast event calendar is quickly filling up again as we bounce back after the COVID-19 impacts. This is great news for the region’s economy and for the long-term prosperity of our tourism businesses,” Cr O’Pray said.

“Our tourism industry contributes $3 billion each year to our local economy with events of all types making a major contribution to attracting visitors and increasing length of stays.

Visit [Events.SunshineCoast](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;to find events of all types and sizes.

The new events hub is a step in the right direction to further strengthen our local economy and help the region continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19.

“Events.Sunshine Coast provides the perfect platform to showcase everything that’s happening at a time when our tourism industry needs a boost,” Cr O’Pray said.

A valuable resource for event organisers, the dynamic website allows users to easily search by an event category, timing or location and automatically pulls listed events from different sources including Australian Tourism Data Warehouse, ticketing systems and Facebook.
