This school holidays, take a wild ride with Venue 114 and host Richard Scholes as he guides you through *The Magical World of Crazy Science* – the ultimate in science on stage for all ages!

Presented by a world-recognised, multi-award-winning entertainer, magician, and visual artist (who is also a scientist and teacher) *Crazy Science* incorporates science, magic, comedy, mime and music to teach children about science in a fun way.

What do you get when you trade a microscope for mime and magic? Giant columns of elephant toothpaste, high-flying toilet paper, zooming smoke rings and the incredible magic of polymers and gigantic bubbles!

Add to this an hilarious mix of interactive comedy, a DJ spinning the music and sound effects and you have the formula for an epic and engaging science show.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said *The Magical World of Crazy Science* was always a sell out event and a popular school holidays show for all ages.

“Richard and his *Crazy Science* show is guaranteed to be entertaining, educational and most importantly, fun,” Ms Thompson said.
