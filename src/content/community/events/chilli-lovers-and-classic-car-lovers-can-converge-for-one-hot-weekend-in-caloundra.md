Our city of beaches is set to come alive with two returning events Downunder Beachfest (11-13 June) and Ignite Chilli Festival Caloundra (12 June).

The Ignite Chilli Festival will have cooking demonstrations, roving entertainment, food, music and artisan stalls open from 10am along Bulcock Street between the roundabouts of Minchinton Street and Otranto Avenue.

Plenty of activities for the kids like the climbing wall ($10), FREE face painting, Chilli arts and crafts, jumping castle, plus Kabi Kabi workshops and storytelling.

Australiaâ€™s favourite fishing presenter Scott Hillier (Creek to Coast) will hold his very own cooking demo and host the Hot 91 Chilli Cook Off with radio presenter Sam Coward (Hot 91.1).

From 4pm the Saturday afternoon program at Happy Valley Park will feature live music with soul full songstress Lisa Hunt, DISCOTrain and the Rock n Roll Boys. Plus dance performances by Cool Cats Rock n Roll.
