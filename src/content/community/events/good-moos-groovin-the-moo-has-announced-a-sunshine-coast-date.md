&#x20;(GTM) organisers shared that they are heading to six regions across the country and welcoming a new location for Queensland – the Sunshine Coast on April 30, 2023.

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O'Pray said this was a huge announcement for the Sunshine Coast.

“It’s really exciting to see a new music festival with such a great reputation on our regional calendar for the year,” Cr O’Pray said.

“I’m sure our local music fans are ecstatic at the thought of this happening in their own backyard at the Kawana Sports Precinct Western Fields.

“Music festivals are such a massive drawcard for tourism, from flights and accommodation to hospitality and adventure activities, all reached in a positive way.

“With Bonza airlines’ new routes announced, it will be a great opportunity for Townsville and Rocky followers to fly direct to the Sunshine Coast and still be part of this Queensland event.

GTM’s Steve Halpin said how happy they were to be able to do a full tour across the country in 2023.

“We have missed you terribly and can’t wait to bring back the good times around the country."

"We’ll be hugging and high-fiving at **Wayville SA** on **Friday 21 April**, which also happens to be school holidays. The festival will bring memory making moments to **Maitland NSW** on **Saturday 22 April**, then will round out the first weekend in our nation’s capital **Canberra ACT** on **Sunday 23 April**. The following weekend, it’s down to beaut **Bendigo VIC** on **Saturday 29 April**, then to a new Queensland location on the **Sunshine Coast** on **Sunday 30 April** (long weekend bonus!). Then, we finally return to the west coast for some **Bunbury** fun on **Saturday 6 May**."

GTM will continue to hold the festival in Queensland in 2023, this time at Sunshine Coast’s Kawana Sports Western Precinct.

Mr Halpin said whilst we are very sad not be returning to Townsville, we look forward to bringing GTM to the Sunshine Coast.

“We have loved calling Townsville our Queensland home over the years, but post pandemic touring life is harder. The logistical challenges and increased financial pressures are too great and unfortunately, we are not able to return to the top end in 2023.”
