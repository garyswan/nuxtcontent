Mountain bike event managers from Rocky Trail Entertainment are set to return to the Sugar Bag Trails this weekend with two days of racing on the popular mountain bike trail network.

Supported by Sunshine Coast Council and endorsed by the Caloundra Off Road Cycling Association (CORCA) on Friday 27 August, the Sunshine Coast edition of the Rocky Trail Academy schools event kicks off with 300 secondary students competing on three race tracks.

The Saturday will feature the Shimano MTB Grand Prix, a cross-country four and six hour endurance race.

The Rocky Trail crew will also be hosting a sunset Pumptrack race, their new "Shootout" format at Sugar Bag on Saturday afternoon.

"These events were developed to engage youth in healthy social and active recreation that brings a heightened appreciation of nature, the environment, self-reliance , self-learning and independence, all as part of riding a bike in the outdoors," said Event Manager Jo Parker.

The school events were launched in late 2019 and have gained in popularity ever since.

Entry is open to all secondary school students and juniors may sign up as part of a school group or independently if a parent or guardian can be with them on the day.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said that the Sunshine Coast region had long been regarded as one of Australia’s most exceptional destinations to host sporting events.

"We’re excited to sponsor and host such an epic mountain biking event in Caloundra at the Sugar Bag Mountain Trails," Cr O'Pray said.

"It’s a great opportunity to showcase some of our remarkable natural assets and especially our growing mountain bike trail network over this two day event." 

**Cross-country event putting endurance skills to the test**

Race Director of the Sugar Bag events Bob Morris said from those who are experiecning their first time between the tape to racers that have spent a lifetime training for power output, they will all enjoy lining up at the start line.

"In the current COVID-19 event recovery stage, registration patterns for the 2021 Rocky Trail season indicated events will continue to grow after a record year in 2020," Mr Morris said.

"With a tight COVID-19 safety plan in place the team will be delivering a safe and enjoyable event."

The race will offer four and six hour competitions for solo and relay pairs competitors across Eeite and age groups as well as junior and eBike categories.

The local CORCA Club endorses the races and will be proudly showcasing the popular trail network to local and visiting riders.

In return the active local club will receive a trail hire fee by the organisers, which will be invested in trail building and maintenance activities.

After the cross-country race on Saturday, the offical Pumptrack opening will feature Rocky Trail's new pumptrack racing format, the "Shootout".

**Pumptrack "Shootout" launches at Sugar Bag**

Always at the forefront of mountain bike events innovations, the Rocky Trail team developed a brand-new, chip-based pump track timing set-up and format over the last few months, which has never been raced in this way before. 

Race participants across a wide range of age groups can clock in multiple race times and the fastest group of racers in male and female classifications will progress through the final Shootout Heat - LIVE timing will be run throughout the event.

The organisers expect a deep field of competitors at the pumptrack race, including local BMX legend Jayce Cunning.

At only 21-years-old the talented shredder has already raced in National and World-level BMX Finals and is currently making a name for himself after recently getting 2nd at the USA BMX Grand Nationals for the A pro class.

Race competitors can now register online via the **[Rocky Trail website](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/UeG0CoV1mECXKY6XC1qqun?domain=rockytrailentertainment.com/)
.**

Spectator entry is free and COVID-19 rules will be communicated via the rider briefing ahead of the race.

All event participants must check in at the Rocky Trail event hub on race day.
