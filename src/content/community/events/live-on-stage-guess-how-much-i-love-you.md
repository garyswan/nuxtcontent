CDP Theatre Producers is delighted to bring to life a brand-new stage adaptation by Richard Tulloch of Sam McBratney’s beloved book GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU, which will make its Sunshine Coast premiere at The Events Centre, Caloundra on Thursday 31 March 2022.

In this dazzling new stage adaptation, children and their families will join the enchanting adventure of Little and Big Nutbrown Hare. This playful story of love and nature unfolds, with beautiful puppetry, music, and laughter as they discover the magic and colour of the seasons.

From the team behind the Australian tours of The Gruffalo, The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show and Spot, this family favourite will excite, educate and entertain new readers and first-time theatregoers.

CDP Theatre Producers is an independent theatre production house and touring company with an unsurpassed track record for developing new productions, putting ideas into action and for producing some of the best theatrical entertainment in Australia.

CDP was recently described by Melbourne’s The Age as “a reliable and prolific source of high-quality children’s theatre”.

CDP was the first company to resume performances in 2020 after COVID-19 shutdowns and the first company to resume interstate touring.

CDP's recent productions for children and families include world premiere stage plays which are adaptations of the popular books The 13-Storey Treehouse, The 26-Storey Treehouse, The 52-Storey Treehouse, The 78-Storey Treehouse, and The 91-Storey Treehouse, David Walliams' The Midnight Gang, David Walliams' Billionaire Boy, David Walliams' Mr Stink, Spot, Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, along with the Australian productions of The Gruffalo, The Gruffalo's Child and Room on the Broom. CDP also produced Sydney Opera House's Meeting Mozart and have toured it extensively in China and the Middle East.

Renowned for their touring expertise, CDP's productions are seen in theatres throughout Australia and New Zealand, in capital cities as well as in metropolitan, regional and remote communities.
