There are just a few days to go until the free Emergency Services and Disaster Preparedness Expo comes to the Sunshine Coast Stadium.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged the entire community to come along on Sunday 30 May from 10am to 2pm.

“The expo offers something for everyone. This is an action-packed but incredibly important event not to be missed,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Kids will love the exciting demonstrations, where they’ll get to see our emergency services responding exactly as they would in a real-life water-bombing, fire, crash or other emergency situation,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Adults can discover what they need to do to prepare for disaster and keep their household safe.

“Our council staff, along with representatives from our emergency services, will be there to chat and share their knowledge with you.

Police Recruit dog Zippa with his big buddy is looking forward to the expo.

“The famous Queensland Police Pipes and Drums are another big drawcard, along with a jumping castle and the chance to win great prizes by visiting all the stalls and collecting stamps on your expo passport. 

“This expo combines family-friendly fun with the opportunity to meet your heroes and ensure everyone in your family knows exactly what to do when disaster strikes.

“As we know all too well here on the Sunshine Coast, when it comes to disasters and emergencies, it’s not a matter of if, but when.”

Sunshine Coast Council is delivering this event in partnership with Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, Queensland Police Service, Queensland Ambulance Service, Energex, State Emergency Service, Defence Australia, Australian Red Cross, Surf Life Saving Queensland, Australian Volunteer Coastguard, Neighbourhood Watch Queensland and Crime Stoppers Queensland.
