A flourishing edible garden might seem impossible for those living in apartments or on small blocks, but an upcoming workshop is about to equip these residents with the skills to create delicious home food gardens utilising the smallest of spaces.

Local gardening gurus Anne Gibson, The Micro Gardener, and Robyn Cook, The Kitchen Garden Teacher, will host a practical and fun session on how to create an edible garden in a small space.

#### **SAVE THE DATE: March 4, 2023**

As part of the Living Lab @ The MET series of workshops, Anne Gibson will inspire, guide and equip you with the 'know-how', as she demonstrates the rapidly growing trend of micro-gardening.

Anne Gibson will teach workshop participants how to grow food in small spaces.

### During this 2.5 hour workshop participants will:

*   Make your own mini micro greens kits to take home.
*   Explore a variety of containers, pods and systems used to grow tasty and nutrient-rich food (herbs, fruits and vegetables) with minimal space and time requirements.
*   Learn how to sow seeds and raise herbs and vegetables as micro greens for a quick and easy year-round harvest.
*   Find out which plants grow best in small containers and what time of year to plant them.
*   Set your garden up for success by finding out how to prepare the soil and fertilise to get the best results.
*   Be inspired to start your very own low cost, edible mini-garden.

Robyn Cook will host a kitchen garden morning tea so participants can sample seasonal flavours with a cuppa (including freshly brewed garden herb teas).

Workshop tickets are $10 + booking fee. Children under 12 are free when accompanied by an adult.
