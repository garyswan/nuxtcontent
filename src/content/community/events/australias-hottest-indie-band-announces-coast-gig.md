A band that smashed Triple J’s Hottest 100 records with their unique sunny indie rock anthems is coming to the Sunshine Coast

Spacey Jane have announced they will stop at Venue 114 as part of their long-awaited regional tour.

From playing local shows to breaking national music records, the indie music darlings are taking their ARIA number one album titled *Here comes everybody* on the road and will be here for one night only – on Wednesday, June 7.  

The Fremantle foursome are the band of the moment after taking out three spots in the top 10 in this year’s Triple J Hottest 100. Their relatable intimate lyrics delivered with an upbeat catchy melody have become the soundtrack for Gen Z.

To celebrate the band’s deluxe edition of their new album, the regional tour would see Spacey Jane play hit singles such as *Hardlight*, *It’s been a long day* and *Sitting up* as well as the bonus track *Sorry instead*.

Band frontman Caleb Harper shared his excitement for taking the deluxe edition of *Here comes everybody* on a regional tour.

“*Sorry Instead* only just missed out on making the album so it feels good to finally have it out in the world! I really like how dark the versus feel compared to the chorus and the woahhhh chants at the end were super fun,” Caleb said.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said the Sunshine Coast music community would be excited to welcome the popular youth band to the community venue.

“Venue 114 has an exciting year ahead with an incredible line-up of homegrown bands playing right here at Venue 114.

“Spacey Jane join Lime Cordiale and Noiseworks as part of an impressive calendar of music and events coming up in 2023. This event is expected to sell out fast with tickets now on sale.

**About Spacey Jane**

Spacey Jane are an Australian indie rock band from Fremantle, which formed in 2016. The group consists of Ashton Hardman-Le Cornu, Caleb Harper, Kieran Lama and, since 2019, Peppa Lane. Their debut studio album, *Sunlight*, was released in 2020 and peaked at number two on the ARIA Charts. For the third year in a row, Spacey Jane have finished in the pointy end of Triple J's Hottest 100 having scored a total six songs in the 2022 countdown. *Here Comes Everybody* cemented the group's specialty in penning sad, intimate meditations disguised as welcoming, sun-kissed indie rock anthems.
