Acclaimed Australian rock band, You Am I, will play homage to one of their greatest influences, The Who, as they play their legendary album Tommy, as well as a set of The Who classics, live on Wednesday 26 July at The Events Centre, Caloundra.

They will be fronted by two of Australia’s most accomplished female rock voices, Hayley Mary (The Jezabels) and Sarah McLeod (The Superjesus), who will share vocals with Tim Rogers to bring the songs to life.

Tommy is the fourth studio album from English rock band The Who, a double album released in May 1969.

It was largely composed by the band’s guitarist Pete Townshend and is presented as a rock opera telling the story of Tommy Walker.

“A preposterous proposition of pomp, power n pithiness to be performed by our pop group, with pals,” said front man Tim Rogers.

“We promise to plunder deep and perform in full plumage with no panache, just passions. Prost!”
