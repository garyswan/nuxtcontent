#### FEATURE ARTISTS

**[LUCY GALLANT](https://soundcloud.com/lucy-gallant)
**

Lucy Gallant is hailed as one of the most talented indie artists on the scene. The British-born virtuoso plays an array of instruments, skillfully producing intricate, high-energy rhythms on the Cajón, while simultaneously singing and playing guitar, drums, ukulele or melodica.

Gallant’s unique voice soars with rhapsodic range, conveying a full spectrum of emotion in her songs. From light-hearted and ethereal to intense and edgy, her vocals propel passion as visceral and versatile as her lyrics.

She writes her own original songs, fusing sounds of rock, reggae, soul, latin and folk-pop.

Having toured the USA, South and Central America, Japan, Australia and much of Europe, the bohemian powerhouse dazzled audiences at both intimate venues and major festivals such as Glastonbury Festival, Beautiful Days Festival, Splendour in the Grass, Caloundra Music Festival, Art Basel, Falls Festival and Australia’s largest music festivals, Woodford Folk Festival and Byron Bay Bluesfest.

**[OSKAR CAMPBELL](http://oskarcampbell.com/)
**

Hailing from the hills of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland this Singer-Songwriter has found his place pulling on heartstrings and sharing his story through music.

Oskar Campbell’s unmistakable sound is the inevitable product of his old school rock influences, infused with a love for modern folk, pop and soul music.

Since the launch of his solo project in 2020 he has notably supported reputable artists such as Xavier Rudd, Busby Marou and The Dreggs.

Having had an inseparable relationship with his guitar and a fascination with all things music from a young age, Oskar naturally gravitated towards performing live and sharing his passion with audiences across Australia.

After testing the waters with various projects, Oskar more recently has been focused on establishing himself as a solo artist, spending the better part of his time writing and recording songs.

With intentions to hit the road with his new creative concoctions, Oskar is preparing for a 2021 jam packed with new music and live shows. You can expect to see a whole lot more from him this year!
