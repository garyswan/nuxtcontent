It's time to welcome 2022 so be sure to have your New Year's Eve plans sorted!

This New Yearâ€™s Eve, Sunshine Coast Council will host fireworks displays in three locations, Caloundra, Mooloolaba and Coolum.

There will be a display in each location at 8.30pm and a further celebration at midnight in Mooloolaba.

Grab a bite at your local eatery beforehand or pack a picnic and find a spot to enjoy the show.

The fireworks celebrations will be glass and alcohol-free environments.
