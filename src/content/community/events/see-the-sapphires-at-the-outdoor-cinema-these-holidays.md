### About the movie:

\_The Sapphires\_ is a 2012 Australian musical comedy-drama film based on the 2004 stage play The Sapphires by Tony Briggs, which is loosely based on a real-life 1960s girl group that included Briggs's mother and aunt. 

Follow the story of four Yorta Yorta women Gail, Julie, Kay and Cynthia, who are discovered by a talent scout and form a music group named *The Sapphires*, travelling to Vietnam in 1968 to sing for troops during the war. This feel-good film stars Deborah Mailman, Jessica Bauboy, Shari Sebbens, Miranda Tapsell and Chris O’Dowd.

Directed by Wayne Blair and written by Keith Thompson and Tony Briggs, the film features an outstanding soundtrack featuring 1960’s songs including *Land of a Thousand Dances*, *I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch),* *I Heard It Through the Grapevine* and *What a Man.*
