**\*\*UPDATE – Unfortunately the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival has been postponed due to wet weather. Council will keep the community informed on a new date\*\***

To celebrate the opening of Mooloolaba’s new Northern Parkland, the Esplanade is set to transform with oceans of free family friendly fun on Saturday, July 2 from 10am – 9pm.

Sumptuous seafood, sand sculptures, mermaids, live music and sea-inspired displays feature among the many highlights for the upcoming Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the festival was a great way to kick-start the school holidays.

“There’s so much to see and do in Mooloolaba – and it just got even more exciting,” Cr Natoli said.

“We’ve partnered with Discover Mooloolaba to deliver the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival, and we’re inviting the whole community to join us.

“Not only can visitors experience the new Northern Parkland, they can also sample delicious food and drinks along the Esplanade, enjoy free rides and face painting with the kids, discover incredible sand sculptures, artisan markets and live entertainment.

“There’s even a Mermaid Headquarters and Neptune's Garden Bar.”

Mooloolaba’s new Northern Parkland will be open and accessible to the public from Friday, June 24, just ahead of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival on Saturday, July 2.
