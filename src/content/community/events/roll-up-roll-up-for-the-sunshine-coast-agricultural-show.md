Is it the show bags, the show jumping or side show alley? Is it the smell of the dagwood dogs, the daredevils on motorbikes or the prize dairy cattle?

All of your show-time favourites and more will be back to tempt and entertain you at the Sunshine Coasts Council’s Nambour Showgrounds from June 10-12 when the 2022 Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show rolls into town!

Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show Manager Penny Walsh said the 116th annual show would showcase a fantastic mix of tradition and New Age entertainment for show-goers at great value for money.

“For more than a century the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show has provided local people with opportunities to showcase their skills, their produce, their products and also to entertain our community in so many ways,” Ms Walsh said.

“That great tradition will continue this year along with some very exciting additions including the ‘Rooftop Express’ which demonstrates the amazing trust between rider and horse and the American Bison.

“Show-goers can still grab a show bag or a tasty treat and take in the cattle judging, the show jumping and the wood chopping. The moto cross bikes and speedway cars will also rev up along with the vintage speedway cars and speedway bikes, and there will be a spectacular fireworks display at 8pm on Friday and Saturday and at 7pm on Sunday evening.

“The price of entry to this year’s show is $20 for adults, $16 for students, while children under the age of five are free. If you purchase tickets online through [www.sunshinecoastshow.com.au](http://www.sunshinecoastshow.com.au)
, you’ll receive a discount (Adults $16, students $12). Family packages can also be purchased exclusively online.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said getting to and from this year’s show would be easy, with convenient public transport and parking options available.

“Accessible parking is available, however other onsite parking will be limited, so visitors are encouraged to make use of the $5 public car parking at MacKellar Mining Depot on National Park Road opposite Ken Mills Toyota and at Crushers Rugby League for $10,” Cr Law said.

“A free shuttle bus service will also run from the Nambour Train Station to the main gate throughout the day until after the fireworks in the evening.

“Accessibility is a high priority for council.

“Thanks to the installation of a passenger lift in the Main Pavilion last year, exhibitions are now accessible for people with mobility issues and for families with prams.

“Council contributed $50,000 towards these much-needed works, while the Federal Government provided $100,000.”
