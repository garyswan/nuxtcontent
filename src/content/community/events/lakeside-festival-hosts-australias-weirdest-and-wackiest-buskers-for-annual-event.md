Over 300 of South East Queensland's most talented performers are gearing up to take center stage at the seventh annual, multi-award winning **Buskers By The Lake.**

Hitting Kawana's Sportsmans Parade on the October long weekend, Buskers by the Lake is a multi-day, multi-event festival with a highly curated must-see line-up of out-of-this-world entertainers and performers. Dancing dogs, acrobatic archers and wheel-of-fire daredevils are just a taste of the artists who will join spirited crowds at the festival's picturesque lakeside location.

Set to be a **fun-filled, family day out** jam-packed with music, artists and creative activities, festival-goers will also have the opportunity to directly support the festival's incredible buskers. As they wind their way along the glistening Lake Kawana, fans can support their favourite acts by distributing tip tokens and their spare cash stash. Festival Organisers have worked hard to keep ticket prices low to encourage tipping and each ticket includes tip tokens to kick things off. **Every cent from cash tips and tip tokens will go directly to each artists.**

“Buskers by the Lake is about showcasing the hidden talents of the busking community and this years’ event will not disappoint,” says festival organiser, Cindy Jensen. “From the **master of levitation**, **Golden Boy** and the amazing musical talents of pitch-perfect musician, **William Martinelli**, to the **skateboarding daredevils** tearing up the floating half-pipe and the **juggling finesse** of **Melon theHuman**, there are so many talented gems to unearth.”
