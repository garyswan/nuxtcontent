Local residents are being called on to record butterflies they see in their backyard, school or local park as part of the Big Sunshine Coast Butterfly Count between March 12-20.

There’s no need to be a butterfly expert, anyone can join in.

Butterflies’ are a sign of a healthy environment.

Both adult butterflies and their caterpillars are food for many creatures, like birds, and also help to pollinate plants and some caterpillars can only feed on specific native host plants.

It’s because of this close relationship with plants that butterflies can be an indicator of the environmental health of an area.

A range of workshops and community survey events are also on offer as part of the count.

All the details are available on [Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve website](https://mary-cairncross.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/See-and-do/Big-Butterfly-Count)
.
