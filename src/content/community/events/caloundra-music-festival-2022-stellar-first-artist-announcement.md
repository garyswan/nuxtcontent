The wait is over for music fans, with the top headliners across the three-day [Caloundra Music Festival](https://caloundramusicfestival.com/)
&#x20;to include Art vs Science, Baker Boy, Ben Lee, Client Liaison, Coterie, Felivand, Missy Higgins, The Presets, The Regime, The Rolling Stones Revue starring Adalita + Sarah McLeod & Tim Rogers, Skunkhour, Vaudeville Smash and The Waifs.

The family friendly festival is now in its milestone 15th year and at the site it started at – the beachside Kings Beach Amphitheatre from September 30 to October 2.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said last year’s survey of attendees showed so much community pride in this event.

“Local residents should feel really proud of the growth of this community festival, established back in 2007 as a one-day event, which is now worth more than $3 million each year in terms of economic and tourism benefits for the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Landsberg said.

“That’s an enduring legacy which continues to benefit our community.

“We had fantastic support from Queenslanders last year, while border restrictions hindered both performers and punters in numerous ways when it came to travel and events.

“This year is a different story. The line-up is strong, and we look forward to welcoming back interstate performers and attendees.”

Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe welcomed the announcement of this year’s headline acts for the iconic Caloundra Music Festival.

“Events like the Caloundra Music Festival bring visitors to the Sunshine Coast and deserve a prominent place on our It’s Live! in Queensland events calendar,” Mr Hinchliffe said.

“Today’s announcement means visitors can start locking in plans for a long weekend music festival getaway to the Sunshine Coast.     

“Caloundra Music Festival is predicted to generate $4 million for the Sunshine Coast’s visitor economy.

“That’s a $4 million boost to the economic recovery of accommodation providers, restaurants, cafes and the Coast’s much-loved tourism experiences.”

Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the Caloundra Music Festival would bring the community together.

“After a great start to 2022 for Sunshine Coast tourism operators, the Caloundra Music Festival is a wonderful way to celebrate our economic recovery now underway,” Mr Hunt said. 

“This is a significant event for the Sunshine Coast and for encouraging visitors to stay longer and enjoy the many amazing tourism experiences our region has to offer.

“The Caloundra Music Festival, now in its 15th year, is primed to attract music fans from around Queensland and interstate.

“I can’t wait to catch this year’s fabulous line-up of acts at the Kings Beach Amphitheatre.”
