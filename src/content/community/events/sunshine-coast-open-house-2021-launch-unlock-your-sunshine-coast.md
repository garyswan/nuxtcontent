A total of 25 of the Sunshine Coast’s most intriguing buildings are set to open their doors and reveal their secrets to the public at this year’s Sunshine Coast Open House on Saturday 23 and Sunday 24 October 2021.

Sunshine Coast Open House is a free community event which provides visitors with the rare\
opportunity to tour a remarkable range of architecturally diverse, sustainable, and historic\
buildings across the region.

Visitors will enjoy discovering long-kept secrets behind some of the region’s most intriguing\
buildings such as the Hinterland’s Bankfoot House and Fairview (Pattemore House), Caloundra’s Lighthouses, mid-century Wilson Beach House, and Gabriel Poole’s Crew House and Quadropod House thanks to a number of renowned Sunshine Coast architects and informed volunteers holding special guided tours.

Sunshine Coast Open House Committee Chair and Australian Institute of Architects Qld Chapter Councillor Lindy Atkin said 25 buildings were opening and offering guided and self-guided tours with the aim of encouraging the general public to explore, re-examine and engage with the region’s built environment.

“This is the one weekend each year when locals and visitors can enjoy rare access to our region’s buildings and have the opportunity to meet the people, architects, designers, planners, engineers, and historians whose contributions make the Sunshine Coast such a special and unique place,” said Ms Atkin.

“Sunshine Coast Open House prides itself on showcasing the rich architectural diversity of the region and provides a unique opportunity for people passionate about the coast to explore and discover its inspiring architecture and cultural heritage.”

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said Sunshine Coast Open House provided the opportunity to see some of the most impressive and interesting attributes of the buildings in our region.

“Sunshine Coast Council is proud to be one of the Founding Partners of Sunshine Coast Open House and a Principal Partner in this year’s program through our Heritage Levy,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It’s a fantastic way for the community to see and consider how architecture and design have contributed to the healthy, smart, creative region we know today.

“The range of heritage buildings on the program this year are a great demonstration of the vibrant consideration of our natural environment that went into the development of\
some of our buildings in decades gone by.”

Sunshine Coast Open House is part of the Open House Worldwide network, founded by Open House London in 1992 and now in 46+ cities around the world. It receives support from the Sunshine Coast Council Cultural Heritage Levy.
