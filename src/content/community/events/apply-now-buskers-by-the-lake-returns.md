It's time to start perfecting those hidden talents, Buskers by the Lake is back!

The three-day family friendly extravaganza will be returning to the Sunshine Coast from Friday 19 to Sunday 21 of August 2022.

Organisers have put out the call for applications to perform at the iconic annual busking festival.

[**Performers of all ages, talents and specialties are invited to apply to join the curated collection of buskers.**](https://www.buskersbythelake.com.au/apply-now)


Whether it's juggling with watermelons, dancing poodles, human scarecrows or absolutely anything in between, applications to perform at Buskers by the Lake are open to everyone.

Sunshine Coast Council Portfolio Councillor Jason O'Pray said the winter spectacular Buskers by the Lake was a fantastic addition to our diverse events calendar.

"It showcases our region as an arts and culture destination," Cr O'Pray said.

"With ambitious growth plans to be a renowned international busking festival, this grass-roots event has real potential to evolve after its debut in 2021.

"The festival is yet to demonstrate its full potential in the region and I’m optimistic that more favourable travel and tourism conditions will see the event grow in year two."

Step into this year’s ‘FANTASYLAND’ and experience the mystical and magical talents of the world’s most fantastical buskers.

After its triumphant debut at its new home along the picturesque Lake Kawana, the multi-award winning Buskers by the Lake will be once again wowing crowds along the waterside.

Music lovers will also have the chance to catch top singer-songwriters go head to head as the prestigious Battle of the Buskers, previously won by Aussie fave Tones and I, kicks off the festivities.

As if that wasn't enough, ticketed sideshows and nightly after parties are set to delight. Boasting an entirely new and wildly diverse lineup, the festival is also sporting a fresh new date that will allow patrons and performers alike to enjoy the fresh breeze and warm sun of late winter.

Event Director, Cindy Jensen, is already busy building a thrilling lineup for this year’s festival and is excited that eased-restrictions and open borders will once again allow performers from all over the globe to join in on the fun.

“We’re coming back bolder and more daring in 2022 and can’t wait to have our travelling performers and fans back, enjoying the festivities in our new Sunny Coast home”.

Got a hidden talent, party trick or special skill to share with the world? There’s no talent too wild, weird or wonderful.
