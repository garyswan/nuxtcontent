Football Queensland (FQ) is excited to announce the return of WinterFest 2023, the state’s largest junior football carnival to be held from Wednesday, 28 June to Sunday, 2 July.

Delivered in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council and Visit Sunshine Coast, WinterFest23 will for a second year be held at Maroochydore Football Complex and will welcome Under 9 – Under 11 boys and girls from all FQ Academy regional centres and invited FQ Academy League teams from South-East Queensland.

“Following the success of the 2022 WinterFest event, which saw over 6,000 families, friends and players in attendance, WinterFest23 is set to once again be a fantastic event for participants, providing them with experience playing within a carnival atmosphere and an opportunity to compete against their peers from other regions,” Football Queensland CEO Robert Cavallucci said.

“Players in attendance will have the opportunity to receive real-time feedback on their performance and have their development monitored as Football Queensland continues to implement best practice technical methods to strengthen pathways with improved player outcomes.

“Football Queensland is excited to partner once again with the Sunshine Coast Council and Visit Sunshine Coast and encourages participants, families and friends to take the opportunity to visit the region’s sights such as Australia Zoo, the Maroochydore Night Markets or one of the many beaches.”

Sunshine Coast Councillor Jason O’Pray said the Sunshine Coast would be a Key Delivery Partner for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games and was set to host nine Olympic and Paralympic events – including preliminary football matches at Sunshine Coast Stadium.

“Hosting WinterFest23 and later in the year the new grassroots Pacific Club Championships in September, is really important to foster sport development opportunities for our juniors,” Cr O’Pray said.

“These kids could end up playing for Australia in the very near future.”

Official merchandise will be available to purchase at the event or online from Football Queensland with more details to come, find out more about the event on the FQ WinterFest23 [webpage](https://footballqueensland.com.au/winterfest/)
