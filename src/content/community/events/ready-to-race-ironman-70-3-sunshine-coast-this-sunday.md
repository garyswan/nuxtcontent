Don’t miss this cracker opportunity to support our 180+ local athletes competing for Ironman and Ironwomen titles, plus local business!

Already this month IRONMAN 70.3 events have been held in Buffalo City in South Africa, Warsaw in Poland, Thun in Switzerland and Region Moselle in Luxembourg.

Now it’s our turn, right here, to host Ironman 70.3 Sunshine Coast in Mooloolaba, Australia.

**Why do we love hosting this world-class event?**

*   IRONMAN embraces the ‘triple bottom line’ approach to delivering events, with a focus on the economic, social and environmental sustainability of each event.
*   For our event, IRONMAN places a significant focus on managing the environmental impact of the event and aims to divert greater than 80 per cent of all event related waste from landfill for the 2021 event and beyond.
*   They spend locally! IRONMAN will be sourcing goods and services from local businesses for this annual event.
*   Minimising impacts – IRONMAN are open to making changes and trying new operational aspects to reduce impacts on our local community.
*   They have been able to decrease build and dismantle times.
*   They have adjusted the site plan this year to allow circulate access via Brisbane Road, River Esplanade, Hancock Street and Walan Street throughout the race day on Sunday September 12 to help keep traffic flowing. Duporth Ave, Maroochydore will no longer be closed for this event.
*   IRONMAN has implemented a number of COVID Safe measures for the event, following on from the successful running of the 2020 IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast, these include increased cleaning, hygiene measures, regular washing of hands and the availability of hand sanitiser.
*   AND while all the athletes are out on the course, you can sit yourself down for breaky, brunch or lunch in Mooloolaba and enjoy all the action as it unfolds.

**There’ll be a few changes around Mooloolaba this weekend for the IRONMAN 70.3, rest assured everything remains open for business.**

*   To keep the traffic flowing there will be circulate access to allow traffic flow via Brisbane Road, River Esplanade, Hancock Street and Walan Street throughout race day. So there's no need to cheat on your favourite Mooloolaba barista - they'll still be expecting you while all the competitors are out on the course. Visit
