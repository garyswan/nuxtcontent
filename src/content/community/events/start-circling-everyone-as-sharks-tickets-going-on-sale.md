NRL is back on the Sunshine Coast!

The Cronulla Sharks will play the North Queensland Cowboys for premiership points at Sunshine Coast Stadium on Saturday, 3 April 2021.

Sharks members can access pre-sale tickets from midday, Wednesday 10 February, with tickets going on sale to the general public from 9am, Monday 15 February.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the Easter long weekend match would provide a fantastic event experience for footy fans on the Sunshine Coast.

“Based on last year’s ticket sales, we are expecting this match to sell out within days,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“It’s also a great opportunity to make the most of an extra-long weekend with family and friends, enjoying all that our fantastic region has to offer.”

Paul Gallen joined a Sharks’ delegation visiting the Stadium today to launch the ticket release.

The former Sharks and NSW Blues legend urged Sharks fans to pack out their Sunshine Coast ‘home away from home’ on April 3.

“The Sharks are very excited to be playing this home game at Sunshine Coast Stadium in 2021 and we really want our members and fans to get on board and make this venue look and feel just like a Sharks home game,” Gallen said.

“Sunshine Coast Stadium looks to be a terrific venue for an NRL game, and the Sunshine Coast is a beautiful place.

“I hope local and visiting Sharks members and fans can be at the game, outnumber the Cowboys’ supporters and be ready to cheer the Sharks on to a win.”

Sunshine Coast Council is proud to continue its partnership with the Cronulla Sharks and re-launch what will be an exciting game of football.

Queensland Health has approved a capacity of just over 6,000 people for the 2021 Round 4 match.

The stadium’s seating configuration allows the Western Grandstand and Try Zones to operate at full capacity with designated seating.

Temporary individual seating will be provided on the Eastern Hill, similar to the arrangements for the 2020 Storm fixtures.

The northern and southern hills will operate at a reduced capacity for social distancing, with patrons to BYO blanket for picnic style seating.

Ticket prices range from $20 to $75. Family packages are available.
