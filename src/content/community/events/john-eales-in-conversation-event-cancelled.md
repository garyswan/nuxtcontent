Due to the health directions related to community safety in relation to COVID-19, the *In Conversation â€“ Learning from Legends* lunch at Venue 114 with guest speaker John Eales and emcee Rupert McCall has been cancelled.

The lunch was scheduled for next Friday 16 July.

Venue 114 hopes to host Eales (who hails from Sydney) and McCall for an *In Conversation* event in 2022 and apologises for any inconvenience.

Ticketek will be in touch shortly with customers to refund all purchased tickets.

Venue 114 thanks everyone for their understanding.
