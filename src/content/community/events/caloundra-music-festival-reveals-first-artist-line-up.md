The festival footprint is expanding again, with the return of the Surf Stage in Lions Park with a new layout and Kings Club offering. The Funky Forest will also pop up nearby in Lions Park.

The Piano Stage is back as well, offering intimate shows with guest artists for Kings Club patrons.

Sunshine Coast Council Divisional Councillor Terry Landsberg said the festival provided an unbelievable buzz around Caloundra - recently named Queensland’s Top Tourism Town.

“The Sunshine Coast is one of the most loved destinations in the world and hosting Caloundra Music Festival offers an unbeatable experience, blending beach vibes and good vibes thanks to the electric line-up of talent each year,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The opportunity to see amazing artists each afternoon and evening means the mornings are free to attend attractions like Australia Zoo, explore the Glass-House Mountains and more.

“There’s something for everyone here on the Sunshine Coast.”

Early birds can grab ALL-IN weekend passes from 8am, Friday, June 23.
