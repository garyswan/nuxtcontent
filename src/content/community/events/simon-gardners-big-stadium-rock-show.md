Relive the heady days this October at The Events Centre with fist pumping, head banging, anthem screaming classic rock from the 80s and 90s.

Watch this awesome show stopping production as one of Australia’s finest and most sought-after rock guitarists, Simon Gardner, whips you into a frenzy of all out epic rock proportions.

Recreating the primal, heart pumping tunes and theatrical antics of heavy rock classics from monsters of the genre like Guns n Roses, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, AC/DC, Kiss, Van Halen, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Ozzy Osbourne and more, Simon Gardner’s Big Stadium Rock Show will have you on your feet and screaming for more!

Presented by one of Australia’s premier rock guitarists, Gardner has released five solo instrumental albums to date and produced and played on a host of albums for other artists.

He has supported and played with artists such as Joe Satriani, Kevin Borich and the late, great Phil Emmanuel.

He has also been a featured artist and clinician for Ibanez Guitars at the Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne Guitar Shows and his music is played regularly on the internationally aired TV program, Guitar Gods and Masterpieces.

It’s more than a show, it’s an experience! Featuring a killer live rock band, singers, dancers, amazing lighting and projection, this show is guaranteed to blow your mind.
