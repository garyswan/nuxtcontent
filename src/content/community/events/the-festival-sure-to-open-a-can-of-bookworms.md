Are you looking for a novel idea this Easter? How about hunting for a literary gem among more than 200,000 offerings at Lifeline Bookfest Sunshine Coast at Nambour Showgrounds.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said a massive range of bargain books would be on sale at the four-day event from Friday, April 7, to Monday, April 10, being held from 9am to 4pm each day. 

“The Lifeline Bookfest is definitely a write of passage that will open a can of bookworms,” Cr Law quipped.

“Last year was the first time Bookfest was held at the Nambour Showgrounds and we had more than 5000 people attend. We’re expecting an even bigger turnout in 2023.”

Along with a range of freshly stocked books, Bookfest will feature toys, puzzles, games, DVDs, records and clothes on sale from $2.50. Lifeline Bookfest organisers have collaborated with the Apex Club of Nambour and other vendors to keep all bookworms well nourished. 

Ample onsite parking will be available via a gold coin donation and all funds raised from Bookfest will go towards Lifeline’s Crisis Support Line. 

### Date: From Friday, April 7, to Monday, April 10.

### Bookfest will run each day from 9am to 4pm.
