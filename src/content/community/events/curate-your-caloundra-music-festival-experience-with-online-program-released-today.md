The Caloundra Music Festival program has been released with a new line up of artists and schedule allowing you to plan your weekend so you don’t miss a beat.

While some interstate acts have been replaced due to COVID restrictions we have outstanding performers on the bill, including  Ball Park Music, Ian Moss, John Butler, San Cisco, Sneaky Sound System, Thelma Plum, The Superjesus, The Whitlams, WAAX and Xavier Rudd.

Download the Caloundra Music Festival App to find the schedule and plan your experience.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the three-day, family festival, held at Kings Beach from October 1-3, provided a much-needed economic boost for our event-industry suppliers, accommodation houses and small businesses.

“We can’t make up for lost income our musicians and suppliers have faced these last 18 months – but council is proud to be supporting the many local businesses which help put this event together,” Cr Landsberg said.

“And we’re thrilled to be offering such a diverse cultural experience that appeals to all ages and brings our community together to celebrate.

“We know our residents from across the region love getting their fill of music, entertainment and cultural experiences. In addition, patrons who come specifically to attend Caloundra Music Festival often return to holiday longer and explore all the Sunshine Coast offers.

“That’s an enduring legacy which continues to benefit our local business owners.”

It’s not too late to get a ticket either for a day or the entire long weekend at [www.caloundramusicfestival.com](http://www.caloundramusicfestival.com)
. The COVID-safe event will comply with health directions.

Festival goers can pre-book with confidence. If further restrictions are mandated that mean the festival cannot go ahead due to Queensland Health directives (e.g. lockdowns), the event will not be postponed to a new date in 2021.  Tickets will automatically be transferred to the 2022 event. Patrons will then have the choice to request a refund.

The Kings Beach amphitheatre and surrounds will transform into a festival site from Monday.

*The Caloundra Music Festival is an event initiative of Sunshine Coast Council and supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland. This event features on the It’s Live! in Queensland events calendar.*
