The TEN Tenors are bringing home their highly acclaimed festive show “Home for Christmas”, after numerous hugely successful tours of the US and Europe.

The show features Christmas classics such as *It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas, O Holy Night* and *Winter Wonderland* as well as modern hits such as *Last Christmas, All I Want For Christmas* and surprises like *Bohemian Rhapsody* and *Anything For Love* – all given the signature The TEN Tenors treatment with incredible 10-part harmonies, and smooth choreography.

The TEN Tenors are a true musical success story, having started more than two decades ago as a casual group of talented friends, and grown over the years into one of the most popular classical-crossover super-groups in the world.

With millions of fans across the globe, The TEN Tenors have headlined more than 2,800 concerts around the world, entertained more than 90 million people, performed alongside artists such as Lionel Richie, Rod Stewart, Andrea Boccelli, Willie Nelson, Alanis Morissette and Christina Aguilera, and recorded 15 albums, including their recent chart-topper Love Is In The Air.

The group playfully blends rock, pop and opera, and are “truly incandescent when performing at the full strength of 10” according to Variety. The New York Times says their “unique mix of the traditional and unconventional offers a fresh and highly-original take on the staid traditions of opera.” TTT have appeared on The Today Show (USA and Australia), Oprah’s Australian Adventure, and Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, among others.
