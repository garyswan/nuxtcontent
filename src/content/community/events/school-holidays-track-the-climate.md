Sunshine Coast Council has partnered with ClimateWatch to create three trails along the Sunshine Coast to allow you to monitor the health of our local ecosystems while enjoying them.

By simply downloading the ClimateWatch app and registering, you can start recording observations. There are designated trails you can follow or simply record sightings anywhere.

The sites that host trails are Kawana Forest north of Meridan Plains, around Currumundi Lake and Maroochy Wetlands in Bli Bli.

Sites range from 1-4km and can be started and finished at any point along the route.

For more information, you can head to [ClimateWatch.org.au](https://www.climatewatch.org.au/trails/queensland)
&#x20;or download their app from your app store.
