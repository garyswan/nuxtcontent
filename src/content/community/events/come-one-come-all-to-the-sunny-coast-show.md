With online tickets, car park shuttle buses and all your favourite show staples, enjoying a day out at the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show will be an absolute breeze.

The Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show is back this year at Nambour Showgrounds from 11-13 June, thanks to COVID-Safe planning and event layout adjustments.

Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show Manager Penny Walsh said show organisers had worked closely with Queensland Health over the past 12 months to host a show that had appropriate COVID-19 measures.

“We have done everything possible to make sure we get it right and ensure that Sunshine Coast families and visitors will have a safe and fun experience at the show,” Ms Walsh said.

“We have rearranged the layout of the showgrounds to allow for social distancing.

“All the unique Sunshine Coast Show traditions our community knows and loves, such as our much-loved competitions, animals, food, sideshow alley, showbags and entertainment will be back.

“We are so excited to bring back the V8 Super utes, monster trucks and wood chopping events as well as the fireworks and laser light show which will light up the sky over three nights.

“And to everyone’s great delight, we’re expecting the best riders in Australia to participate in the show jumping competition.”

COVID-Safety also includes online ticket sales. While tickets at the gate will cost $10 for students and $18 for adults, those who purchase their tickets online will receive a 20 per cent discount and will also be able to access the fast-track lane at the gates for streamlined entry to the show.

Children under five years are free.

Accessible parking is available, however other onsite parking will be limited, so visitors are encouraged to make use of the public car parking at MacKellar Mining, 4 National Park Road, Nambour, opposite the Nambour Showgrounds.

A free shuttle bus service, running from 8.45am until late, will do a loop of Nambour, picking up from Sunshine Coast Council’s Nambour administration office car park at the Bury Street entrance and the Nambour train station, and dropping show-goers right at the showground’s front gates.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see adjustments made for the health and safety of show-goers, and he was especially proud that access improvements had been made to the Nambour Showground’s Main Pavilion.

“Thanks to the installation of a new passenger lift in the Main Pavilion, the Schools on Show, Art and Photography exhibitions are now accessible for people who have mobility issues and for families with prams,” Cr Law said.

“This improvement is one of many new exciting features people will enjoy at the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show this year.

“So please make time to support the Show and remember to be COVID-Safe at all times. This includes maintaining social distancing and washing your hands often. Please stay home if you’re unwell and get tested if you have any COVID symptoms.”    

For those interested in helping out, the show is also looking for community groups, schools, or volunteers to assist with gates, ticketing, crossing supervisors and more.

Volunteers who work more than four hours at the showgrounds will be given free entry, and community groups may receive a donation from the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show Society.
