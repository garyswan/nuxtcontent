Athletes from across Australia and around the world are putting the final touches to their preparations for the Qatar Airways IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast this Sunday 11 September.

The 2022 event has sold out, with more than 2,000 athletes set to take on the 1.9km swim starting and finishing on Mooloolaba Beach, a 90km ride taking in the Sunshine Motorway and a 21.1km run finishing on the Mooloolaba Esplanade.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said IRONMAN continues to be a great opportunity to showcase the Sunshine Coast.

“Our region offers so much for event participants and visitors and we are really pleased the 2022 event has sold out.

“Aside from the global exposure from being part of IRONMAN 70.3 series, this event provides an invaluable contribution to many of our local businesses outside of the peak tourism seasons.”

Geoff Meyer, Managing Director of Oceania for The IRONMAN Group, said that the team looked forward to welcoming athletes back to the Sunshine Coast.

“The Qatar Airways IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast is a firm favourite for athletes from home and abroad and we look forward to seeing more than 2,000 out on course achieving their goals this Sunday,” said Meyer. “The Sunshine Coast is the perfect setting for an event like this and with it welcoming one of its biggest fields in years our athletes certainly agree.

“We’re also set to welcome some of the top professional athletes in the region back to the Sunshine Coast and are excited for what will be close racing in both the men’s and women's fields,” he said. “With an IRONKIDS event also taking place on Saturday there are plenty of opportunities for the whole family to be involved in Qatar Airways IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast.”

Tourism and Sport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast was a good example of Queensland events building back better, for more good, secure jobs. 

“We know the organisers of this highly regarded Sunshine Coast event have worked hard on recovery,” Mr Hinchliffe said. “The good news is four times as many competitors and spectators as last year are predicted by organisers to visit the Sunshine Coast for IRONMAN 70.3 and our great Queensland lifestyle. 

“More visitors mean more demand for Sunshine Coast accommodation, transport, restaurant and café hospitality and iconic tourism experiences,” he said. “The Queensland Government continues to back IRONMAN on our It’s Live! In Queensland events calendar because of its significant support for the region’s visitor economy.”

Qatar Airways IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast is supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland and features on the It’s Live! in Queensland events calendar.
