Volleyball Australia (VA) is pleased to confirm that the opening leg of the Australian Junior Beach Volleyball Tour will be held in Queensland on the Sunshine Coast’s spectacular Mooloolaba Beach.

The Australian Junior Beach Volleyball Tour is the premier domestic event for junior beach volleyball athletes, bridging the gap between the Youth and Australian Beach Volleyball Tour.

Australia’s best U19 and U21 athletes will converge on Mooloolaba Beach from 19 to 21 January, before heading to Cobram-Barooga for Round 2, and the finals at Manly Beach in New South Wales.

Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said holding the Australian Junior Beach Volleyball Tour activates Mooloolaba Beach and showcases our regions natural assets.

“The Sunshine Coast’s magnificent beaches are the perfect location for elite beach volleyball competitions.

“We are excited to host the Australian Junior Beach Volleyball Championships from January 19 – 21 and also the Queensland Open immediately after on the 22 and 23 January. 

“The hosting of both of these elite tournaments back to back will ensure many participants will remain in the area for both events.

“This is expected to extend visitation to the region and maximise spending within the local economy.

“This sponsorship strengthens our relationship with Volleyball Australia, creating real potential for the council to secure additional events from Volleyball Australia, both beach and indoor,” Cr O’Pray said.

Volleyball Australia CEO Andrew Dee said he is looking forward to bringing the debut three-leg tour to the country’s best junior athletes.

“With the addition of Mooloolaba, it is great that we are able to put on a three-stop tour for some of our country’s best beach volleyball talent,” Dee said.

“The Sunshine Coast is home to some of Australia’s most spectacular beaches, and to be able to play the opening round of the Junior Tour on Mooloolaba Beach is a fantastic opportunity for our junior athletes to showcase their skills.

“This summer is shaping up to be one of our biggest summers to date, and to be bringing a dedicated tour for our junior athletes is a fantastic step in the right direction for our sport,” he said.
