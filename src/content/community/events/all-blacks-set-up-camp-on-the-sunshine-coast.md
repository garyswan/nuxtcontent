Rugby fans can see the world’s best up close and personal at an open training session of the New Zealand All Blacks at Sunshine Coast Stadium on Tuesday 12 October.

The All Blacks have chosen our Sunshine Coast to prepare for their upcoming  tour to the Northern Hemisphere, which starts with the 1874 Cup match against the United States in Washington, DC on October 23.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said hosting the Rugby Championship champions was a terrific show of confidence in our region’s capacity to host premiere sporting training camps and events.

“Our region is well known for hosting major events.

“Showcasing top sporting talent allows our aspiring rugby union players to see their heroes in action and celebrate their success which in turn encourages an active and connected community.”

Fans can see the All Blacks in action when the team open the doors of Sunshine Coast Stadium for a training session and a Q\&A session with players and coaches to share their stories and answer questions from fans on Tuesday 12 October, 9–11am.

Queensland Health directives must be followed at the event including scanning the QR codes at the venue and checking in upon arrival, wearing face masks and not attending if you are unwell.
