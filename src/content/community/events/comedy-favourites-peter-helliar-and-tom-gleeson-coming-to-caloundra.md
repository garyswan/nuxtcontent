Two of Australian comedy’s best, Peter Helliar and Tom Gleeson, are hitting the stage for a great night out at The Events Centre, Caloundra this September!

Peter Helliar has cemented himself as one of Australia’s favourite comedians.

He’s the creator and star of Network Ten’s How To Stay Married and brings the laughs to The Project four days a week.

Pete has performed stand-up for more than twenty years and makes the difficult business of being funny look dead easy.

Tom Gleeson has performed at every major comedy festival in the world and is a true master of the craft.

When he’s not hosting hit ABC TV show Hard Quiz, the Gold Logie winner is busy being one of the best comedians in the country. Tom is a sure-fire, killer stand-up at the top of his game.
