Bring the whole family down to Nambour Forecourt Live! for a fun, free community event to celebrate the new-look community space with children’s activities, live music, art workshops, entertainment food and more.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said this exciting opening party was a wonderful way to deliver on the Nambour Activation Plan (endorsed 2015) and showcase the refurbishments to the community.

He invited everyone to participate in the COVID-safe event.

“The forecourt in front of council’s Eddie De Vere building has been given a fresh new look. Works started on the façade with pops of colour enveloping the amenities block and wrapping around the library,” Cr Law said.  

“Now locals and businesses can enjoy the rejuvenated space boasting splashes of colour, festoon-inspired lighting, leafy green accents and plenty of shaded seating.

“It was great to watch the ‘Golden Ratio Rainforest’ mural brought to life by Sunshine Coast artist Alison Mooney.

“This spectacular mural guides onlookers’ eyes from the Nambour Library around to the council building and will make an incredible backdrop for the free community event.

“I am encouraging everyone to come on down to Nambour Forecourt Live! and celebrate their space on Friday 10 September from 2-8pm, outside the Council Chambers on the corner of Currie and Bury streets.

“The entertainment program will begin at 2pm with Sunshine Coast Libraries presenting Rhymes with Ryan for the toddlers and games and entertainment from Qmusic Children's song winners Nyssa Ray and Andrea Kirwin.

“The main entertainment will kick off at 5pm with live music by soul artist Hannaka followed by Casio Keyboard King, Asher Beau and reggae duo Solua to close.

“Delicious food will be available from Viet Nom Nom and free creative workshops will be running between 4-5.30pm including donut decorating, coconut fibre weaving and children's art activities.”

The community is reminded to stay COVID alert and stay at home if unwell.

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in using the Queensland Government QR code and follow Queensland Health directions including mandatory mask wearing, unless under 12 years or for health reasons.

“The community event is a great way to cement the aim of the revamp which is to create a space that provides opportunities for people to relax, have fun and socialise and I think Council’s Placemaking and Design team has done just that,” Cr Law said.

“Introducing more shade and extending the grassed area into a central open lawn has softened and helped cool the area.

“While the mural provides layers and gives off rainforest feels, the installation of leafy trees and plantings incorporated with recycled seating under a canopy of festoon lighting adds a relaxed atmosphere – essentially the Sunshine Coast way of life.

 “Whether you’re visiting the library, having some lunch or accessing council’s customer service centre, this space is inviting and has a strong sense of purpose.”  

Community groups looking to use the space for events, busking or market stalls, please visit council’s [events page](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/en/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Events/Holding-Events)
&#x20;for more information.  

Additional shade for the existing slide is also being investigated, so that it will be in place as the warmer weather returns later this year.
