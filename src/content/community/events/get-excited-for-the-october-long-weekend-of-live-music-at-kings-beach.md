Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the festival continued to provide an annual economic boost for the region’s event-industry suppliers, accommodation houses and small businesses.

“We’re eager to offer a unique beachside music festival experience that appeals to all ages and brings our community together to celebrate live music,” Cr Landsberg said.

“The festival has evolved over 15 years from its simple one stage set-up in 2007 to multiple stages that showcase a mix of music genres from local talent to popular performers.

“The BYO H2O initiative introduced back in 2013 is still just as important to us today.

“The festival’s popularity continues to be a draw card for visitors from New South Wales and Victoria, our most popular ticket buyers from other states, with a large Queensland contingent of locals and the intrastate drive market.

“We know our residents from across the region love getting their fill of music, entertainment and cultural experiences and it’s a great event for visitors to finish off the school holidays with something special to create family memories.
