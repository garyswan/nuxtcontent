Cleverly engineered robots climbing vertical surfaces, battling in sumo arenas, and negotiating mazes is just some of the excitement you can see at a RoboRAVE.

RoboRAVE is an [international series](https://roboraveinternational.org/#/)
&#x20;of competitive robotics events held around the world, with challenges aimed at students from primary up to university and adults. 

Competitors need to design, build and program a fully autonomous robot to complete a given task, like using vision technology to follow lines and track objects.

[RoboRAVE Australia](https://roboraveaustralia.com/)
 is an annual robotics competition run by a team of volunteers at Pro Active Robotics, a hub of state and private schools operating on the Sunshine Coast, and in its fourth year has introduced the new MegaBot Challenge for the 2023 International Open.

RoboRAVE Australia and Sunshine Coast Council are encouraging participants and volunteers to secure tickets once registrations open in April, 2023, ahead of the RoboRAVE competition in July.

RoboRAVE Australia 2022 in action.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said council supported Pro Active Robotics’ objectives to promote the uptake of robotics and coding through staff and student training days, school visits and a range of fun competitions.

Pro Active Robotics has worked with RoboCoast to increase the capacity of robotics and engineering education on the coast with more than 5500 students, 1000 teachers and 170 schools benefitting from their robotics program since 2017.

“We want to see real opportunities addressing youth skills development for future and emerging industries, ensure higher education and reskilling opportunities for adults, and develop career pathways for graduates within our region,” Cr Landsberg said.

“It has helped forge world-class robotics teams such as Chancellor State College’s RoboRoyals, who received support from council to travel to Houston, Texas to represent Australia at the World Championships in 2019.

“They placed second in one of the most prestigious categories on a world stage.

“Hosting this competition continues to build the Sunshine Coast’s status as a centre of excellence for robotics and technology, as well as profile our region to an international and interstate market.”

*Winners* RoboRAVE Australia 2022

RoboRAVE Australia President Tim Hadwen said RoboRAVE Australia provided students with a great way to test their robotics skills and learn from other students.

“In 2023 we expect even more students to travel from interstate and overseas to compete,” Mr Hadwen said.

“This year we’ve also added new competitions and will have our biggest event yet leading up to the World Championships in 2024."

The Australian event on July 15-16 is supported by Sunshine Coast Council through the Major Events Sponsorship Program and is expected to attract 1500 participants. Further [sponsorship opportunities](https://roboraveaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sponsorship_opportunities_2023-v1_web.pdf)
&#x20;are available for like-minded businesses.

In 2024, the Sunshine Coast will be the host location for RoboRAVE World Championship, which will attract up to 4000 participants from around the world.
