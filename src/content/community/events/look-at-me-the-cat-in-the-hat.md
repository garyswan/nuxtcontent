*The Cat In The Hat* is coming to Caloundra these school holidays!

The much-loved children’s phenomenon will be performing at The Events Centre, Caloundra on Friday 30 June.

Two bored kids, one rainy day\_, a*nd one crazy cat wearing a red-striped hat*.\_

![](https://preview-assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c631baf8-1b46-001f-580c-d0001b68b4a8/c68a851f-a573-4c3e-ba76-e1c686d157e7/2-1-1024x768.png)

In 1957, Dr Seuss used only 200 words to write his classic tale. More than 50 years later, it’s still a much-loved children’s phenomenon.

The play was adapted for the stage in 2009 by the National Theatre of Britain. 

\_The Cat In The Hat\_ interrupts this rainy afternoon with his unexpected visit to Sally and her brother’s cosy home. Their outspoken and outraged pet, \_Fish,\_ is astounded and concerned, but this cat will not be deterred. He will teach us all to make our own fun with nothing but a little imagination. *“It’s fun to have fun, but you have to know how”.*

Along with \_Thing One\_ and \_Thing Two,\_ the cat will fill the theatre with mischievous humour and madcap style.

Young and old alike will delight in this lively adaptation of a classic book coming to life before your very eyes.
