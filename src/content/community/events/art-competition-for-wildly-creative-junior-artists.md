Junior artists from across Queensland are called on to unleash their creativity and enter Sunshine Coast Council’s Wild HeART Student Art competition for native Australian plants and animals.

Students can enter their artwork into three age categories for a chance to win a share of $3000 in prizes before entries close on Sunday, July 17, 2022.

Sunshine Coast Environmental Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said this year the art prize had been reimagined to include all Australian native wildlife and plants.

“School-aged students from across Queensland are encouraged to submit an artwork that realistically portrays an Australian animal or plant,” Cr Suarez said.

“This year’s prize celebrates all of Australia’s native wildlife and plants so students can learn about their chosen specie’s unique qualities and its place in our landscape.

“When selecting their subject, students should consider why they chose the species, whether it’s threatened, if they have a connection with it and whether they have learnt anything new through the creative process.

“Our aim is to help create a deeper connection and respect between children and their natural environment and we encourage all eligible students to enter.”

There are three ages categories – 8 years and under; 13 years and under; and 19 years and under.

The Wild HeART Student Art Prize is generously supported by Friends of Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Gardens, Friends Regional Gallery Caloundra Inc., Wildlife Preservation Society of Qld - Sunshine Coast & Hinterland Inc. and Qld Wildlife Artists Society Inc.

All entry instructions, forms, eligibility criteria and conditions are available at <https://botanic-garden.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/See-and-do/Wild-HeART-Student-Art-Prize>
