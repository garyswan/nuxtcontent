Off the back of the sold out *In Conversation* event with special guest Layne Beachley, Venue 114 is thrilled to be launching the next *In Conversation – Learning from Legends* lunch with former Wallabies captain and World Rugby Hall of Fame legend John Eales AM.

Scheduled for Friday 16 July at Venue 114, Bokarina and set to be a sellout this empowering event is one not to be missed! 

John Eales is still to this day the highest point-scoring forward in the history of Rugby Union and will share his messages on leadership, teamwork and culture.

Internationally renowned poet Rupert McCall will MC the event, while also sharing some of his greatest pieces of work.

Eales debuted for the Wallabies in 1991 and captained the side from 1996 until the end of his test career in 2001. But not even he could tip his meteoric rise in the world of rugby.

“How could I have known where this game would take me when as a seven year old, I ran onto the field for the first time in Brisbane,” Eales said.

“Anyone who has embraced rugby has been rewarded by the game many times over.”

He went on to win the first Bledisloe Cup.

“That was just another extraordinary moment in my career. It was the 1992 test series, the first in which we had five-point tries. The All Blacks had won the first test by one point, we won the second by two points and won the third by three points. It was a great moment in my career and I felt lucky to have been there.”

Eales was inducted into the Sports Australia Hall of Fame, the World Rugby Hall of Fame, the Australia Institute of Sport’s Best of the Best, awarded the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1999 for services to the community and rugby. His outstanding qualities extend further than the football field, he is also an inspirational leader and businessman.

Eales was the founder of the Mettle Group – a consultancy which was acquired by Chandler Macleod in 2007, and sits on the boards of Flight Centre Travel Group, Fuji Xerox-DMS, Magellan Financial Group, Chair World Rugby Hall of Fame Selection Panel & Rugby Australia World Cup Advisory Committee. He has been an occasional lecturer at the University of Notre Dame in Sydney and is the author of *Learning from Legends: Sport* and *Learning from Legends: Business*.

Rupert McCall’s tributes to special events and occasions have become highly sought-after and treasured for the indelible mark they’ve left on audiences everywhere.

He is the author of six anthologies of verse that have collectively sold more than 120,000 copies.
