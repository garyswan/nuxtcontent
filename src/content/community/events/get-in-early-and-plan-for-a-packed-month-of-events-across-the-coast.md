Sunshine Coast residents are being urged to break away from their day-to-day and enjoy some stellar events to keep many entertained this month.

From rugby to disc-golf, bowling and canoeing, plus cabaret, the arts, comedy and a free family-friendly festival there really is something for everyone to experience and enjoy.

This weekend, Beach Rugby Australia will take over a section of Mooloolaba Beach for the [Beach 5s rugby](https://www.facebook.com/events/1164619530809485)
, which will be a real sport spectacle for locals and visitors to enjoy.

To celebrate the fresh new Mooloolaba Northern Parkland, the Mooloolaba Esplanade will transform with oceans of free family friendly fun on Saturday, November 5, from 10am – 9pm.

Sumptuous seafood, sand sculptures, mermaids, live music and sea-inspired displays will feature among the many highlights for the [Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival](https://fb.me/e/3NaBnUF3e)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said aside from one of the best beaches in the world, Mooloolaba offered a hub for eating, shopping and dining every day of the week.

“Mooloolaba is the place to be, and with community and sporting events over the weekend, it really comes alive,” Cr Natoli said.

“Come down for some free family fun and experience some terrific events.”

Visitors to Mooloolaba are encouraged to catch public transport, cycle, scoot or walk to the event or conveniently park at the Mooloolaba Central ParknGo for $5 all day, accessible via Brisbane Road or Smith Street. A spend of $30 or more in Mooloolaba will get you free parking through a new parking validation offer.

Suncity Bowl will be busy with the International Bowling Federation presenting the Para Bowling World Cup from November 3-10, and IBF World Cup will run from November 11-23. Held in partnership with the Queensland Government and Sunshine Coast Council, the event is estimated to attract 1700 visitors.

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said sporting events did really well in terms of participants and numbers with the Ironman 70.3 held in September sold out this year.

Our cultural events are really important to the community, and to ensure they continue to be offered in the future, it’s important people support them,” Cr O’Pray said

“What would really help our local businesses and event organisers is for people to make that decision early, and essentially invest in the event.

“We need to move away from the ‘last minute’ culture when it comes to buying tickets for events, so event organisers can gauge product and service levels needed to put on a great event.”

The [Sunshine Coast Comedy Festival](https://www.sunshinecoastcomedyfestival.com/)
&#x20;has a series of events from November 10-13 with an opening night extravaganza at NightQuarter (Birtinya) and shows at Brouhaha (Aura), The Events Centre (Caloundra), The Imperial Hotel (Eumundi), The Power Boat Club (Golden Beach), Solbar and The Nautical (Maroochydore), and Your Mates (Warana).

For your viewing pleasure, the 12th annual [Sculpture on the Edge](https://artsconnectinc.com.au/aci-events/sculpture-on-the-edge/)
, hosted by Arts Connect Inc will be on exhibition at Flaxton Gardens. Look, see and think on more than 80 pieces on display while also taking in breathtaking views from the venue. The FREE exhibition is open to the community every day from November 20 to December 4 between 9am and 3pm.

Disc Golf is a growing sport in Australia, and with 192 participants the sold out [Australian Disc Golf Championships 2022](https://www.adgc.com.au/)
&#x20;will take place at Landsborough on November 18-20. Disc golf is played much like traditional golf. Instead of a ball and clubs, however, players use a flying disc (or frisbee) with the object to complete each hole in the fewest number of strokes (or, in the case of disc golf, fewest number of throws). It’s a great outdoor game for the family, so get along and see what it’s all about. Spectator tickets from $5.

For a spectacle on Lake Kawana, check out the [Australian Outriggers annual National Sprint Championships](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/16640575-a/ao-national-sprints-championships)
&#x20;with junior and senior outriggers vying for a National Title from November 18-20.
