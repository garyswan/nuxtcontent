She was the darling of the pool, but behind her golden smile lay doubts, insecurities and fears.

Sunshine Coast residents will have a rare chance to hear about the highs and lows of one of Australia’s greatest swimmers and learn how she rose above adversity.

Leisel Jones will feature as the special guest speaker at Venue 114’s *In Conversation* long lunch celebrating International Women’s Day 2023.

Having overcome her own personal challenges, including mental health and body image battles, Leisel is well known for motivating her audiences to live with authenticity and integrity.

Scheduled for Wednesday, March 8, at Sunshine Coast Council’s Venue 114, Bokarina, this long lunch will see Leisel share her story with her trademark sincerity and good humour.

The beloved champion is known for her outstanding swimming career, winning seven World Championships titles, nine Olympic medals, 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals, 14 individual world records and 23 National titles.

These days she is channelling the drive she had in the pool to share her very personal journey of what it is to be an Olympian — the triumphs as well as the battles.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he welcomed the opportunity for Venue 114 to host another inspiring International Women’s Day event to celebrate achievements and raise awareness for women’s equality.

“Venue 114’s signature *In Conversation series* provides the perfect platform to celebrate the annual event and we are delighted to host Leisel and explore this year’s theme to #EmbraceEquity,” Cr Law said.

“Leisel is a vibrant and positive role model, drawing on parallels between lessons in the pool and lessons in life.”

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said council had been a long-time supporter of International Women’s Day.

“We have had the honour of previously hosting surfing legend Layne Beachley and author and journalist Melissa Doyle, here at Venue 114,” Ms Thompson said.

“Both had the same passion for sharing their lived experiences to empower other women to live their most authentic life.”

Listen to Leisel’s inspiring keynote as she reflects on her journey. She will be joined by special guest MC, local radio personality and sport commentator Ash Gierke.

Guests will enjoy canapes on arrival, a delicious main course accompanied by a selection of champagne, wine and beer thanks to Penfolds Catering. Local artist Tess Fapani will entertain guests with her smooth folk and indie tones.

### **About International Women’s Day**

International Women's Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women's equality.

IWD has occurred for more than a century, with the first IWD gathering in 1911 supported by over a million people. Today, IWD belongs to all groups collectively everywhere. Through the 2023 theme of #EmbraceEquity, celebrate women's achievements, raise awareness about discrimination and take action to drive gender parity.
