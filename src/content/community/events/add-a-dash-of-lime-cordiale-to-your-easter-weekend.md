It’s time for a night of some Lime Cordiale-flavoured fun as one of Australia’s hottest bands makes a unique visit to Venue 114.

Featuring all the hits from their repertoire, plus new songs and a few surprises, this is one of the few chances for you to see this red-hot group in a headline appearance in Australia in 2023.

It will be happening right here on the Sunshine Coast on Saturday, April 8.

Renowned for their infectious performances and quirky nature, they have been one of the nation’s buzziest acts over the past couple of years.

They have been touring both nationally and internationally with hit singles such as ‘Robbery’ and ‘Money’.

Winning both ‘Breakthrough Artist 2020’ and ‘Best Australian Live Act 2021’ at the ARIA Music Awards and ‘Australian Album of the Year’ 2020 at the J Awards – Lime Cordiale is not to be missed.
