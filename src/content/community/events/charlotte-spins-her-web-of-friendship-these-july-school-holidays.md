In a special winter school holiday treat, Venue 114 will feature the funny and touching live theatre show *Charlotte’s Web* on Tuesday 6 July.

This captivating, quality performance is a must-see for children with an added bonus of an animal farmyard on hand including goats, lambs, rabbits and even piglets set-up in Venue 114’s lakeside courtyard for children to explore, take pictures and make new furry friends.

*Charlotte’s Web* is a much-loved classic tale telling the story of the show’s beloved hero, Wilbur the Pig, and his relationships and triumphs while meeting his friends Charlotte the Spider, Fern the farmer’s daughter and farmyard characters Templeton the Rat, Sheep, Goose and Gander.

The stage production captures young hearts and inspires imaginations as the enchanting story carries timely messages about valuing friendship, loyalty, accepting differences and living a full life.

The heart-warming children’s fable is adapted by Joseph Robinette from the classic book by E.B. White, while the RAVA Productions show is directed by Alison Vallette, produced by Ruth Atkinson and designed by Madeline Barlow.

Families will follow Wilbur’s journey as he braves his new world forming friendships and warming hearts through his adventures, learning about life and death, miracles, loyalty and trust.

Filled with wide-eyed innocence, Wilbur (Harrison Paroz) – the runt of the litter – bonds with Fern (Courtney Wagner), growing into a terrific, radiant little pig. He finds a new home in a barnyard filled with characters, including gluttonous Templeton rat (Jacob Watton), chatty Gander (Angela Ponting) and bleak Sheep (Mike Escober). 

Wilbur forms an unlikely friendship with Charlotte (Sita Walker) the spider. Their bond inspires the animals around them to come together as a family. When she gets word that Wilbur's days are numbered, Charlotte hatches a plan spinning her miracle to save his life.
