Forget video games these school holidays: these workshops will have the kids creating and playing with abandon, using real hand tools to bring their imaginings to life.

The MET, in partnership with Wildlings and Living Smart, will run the *City Makers – Loose Parts Workshop* across three days, encouraging kids aged 3-12 years to create art, tinker with tools, design and construct miniature cities and complete garden crafts. 

## Save the date

#### **When**: June 28, 29 and 30, 9.30am-11.30am

#### **Where:** The MET, Corner First Ave and South Sea Islander Way, Maroochydore

#### **Cost:** Tickets $8 per child, per session, bookings essential

The workshop will provide a playground of miscellaneous materials from nature or repurposed from building sites, along with tools including hand saws, hammers and nails to build their creations.

Council’s Living Smart Program will provide activities to help children create a seed bomb of flowers for the garden, make tiny homes for tiny creatures from clay and natural materials, and make a bamboo trellis for climbing plants.

Trained supervisors from Wildlings Forest School will be on hand and a parent must also be present during the session.

Parents should directly supervise younger children who are using hand tools.
