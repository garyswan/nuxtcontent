This is the third event in [Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden's The Backyard Series](https://oursc.com.au/community/events/learn-how-to-create-a-beautiful-native-garden)
.

Do you want your backyard to be more welcoming for wildlife?

Just like humans, our native creatures have different needs for shelter, safety and sustenance. Come along to this workshop with Natalie Sanderson from Backyards for Biodiversity where you’ll learn about designing for diversity through garden layering.

Layering is a crucial factor for a garden with high habitat values.

From lizards that need ground level hiding spots, little wrens who like grasses and small shrubs, to the tree-dwelling birds and marsupials who need to be up high – every creature has a favourite level.

No matter the size of your yard, simple design tricks can make your place better habitat. Come and learn how to create layering and make your place a ‘backyard for biodiversity’.

This workshop will be followed by a walk through the Botanic Garden to see some of the principles in practice.

Backyards for Biodiversity was founded in 2022 as a not-for-profit incorporated company.

It promotes urban biodiversity in South East Queensland by actively supporting and encouraging residents to implement practical strategies with a focus on local native plants for local native animals.

Natalie Sanderson is currently completing an ecology degree at the University of the Sunshine Coast and is also employed as a conservation biology researcher. She is a co-founder of Backyards for Biodiversity and passionate about creating habitat for our wildlife in our backyards.
