Music lovers are in for a huge treat at this year’s Caloundra Music Festival (CMF) with US band **Arrested Development** scheduled to exclusively play for two days after rave reviews of their performance at the festival in 2018.

Kiwi band **Katchafire**, who have a huge fan base here in Australia, will also make a welcome return to the CMF stage.

With a line-up that appeals to a mix of music genres and ages, this year’s festival is going to be packed with sun, surf and soul over three days from September 29 to October 1 at Kings Beach on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast.  

The two international bands join an array of great artists already announced including Busby Marou, Illy, Jack River, Jarryd James, Kasey Chambers, L.A.B (NZ), Sampa the Great, Spiderbait, The Temper Trap, Thirsty Merc and Vera Blue.

Adding to that mix will be Caravãna Sun, Chris Ah Gee, Diesel, FOOLS, Hiatus Kaiyote, JaZZella, Melbourne Ska Orchestra, Ray Beadle Stax of Blues, Roshani, Ross Wilson & The Peaceniks, The Black Sorrows, The Strides, 19-Twenty and 1927.

Playing at Coachella in the US earlier this year, future-soul ensemble Hiatus Kaiyote have just sold out their Sydney Opera House concert.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said he hoped the international line-up would draw New Zealand fans, who can book direct flights to the Sunshine Coast Airport through Air New Zealand.

“New regional flight routes, in addition to the regular flights from Sydney and Melbourne into Sunshine Coast Airport will provide music lovers a great opportunity to see a number of their favourite Aussie bands in one place, while making a holiday of it in one of the world’s most loved destinations,” Cr Landsberg said.
