People, place and planet will combine in Venue 114’s next signature *In Conversation* event.

*In Conversation – Life Repurposed* will feature special guest OzHarvest founder and CEO, Ernst & Young Social Entrepreneur of the Year and Australian Local Hero of the Year, Ronni Kahn.

Scheduled for Friday, October 7, at Venue 114, Bokarina, this will be a breakfast not to be missed.

After a successful career in corporate events, and after a visit to her country of origin South Africa, Ms Kahn was galvanised into action and embark upon a challenge to make a difference to people’s lives.

Ms Kahn established OzHarvest in 2004 and was instrumental in changing food waste legislation across Australia, allowing the organisation to deliver more than 218 million meals to women, children and men in need – while also rescuing over 72,000 tonnes of food from ending up as landfill and waste.

Listen to her inspiring keynote speech as she reflects on her journey to find purpose in life and in business.

Ms Kahn is feeling energised and looking forward to sharing how to channel her skills, knowledge and passion to contribute to a greater good.

“Living a life with purpose is our birthright,” Ms Kahn said.

“I’m committed to shining a light on where it is we find our purpose.”

Ronni Kahn will be joined by special guests including MC Deb Caruso who is a local publishing legend with a passion for slow food, and a panel of local change agents who are creating a greater good through doing things differently:

*   Christine Ballinger, Farm Manager at The Falls Farm
*   Naomi Elliot, General Manager at Concept Labs
*   Tracey Morris, CEO of charity No More Fake Smiles
*   Alana Kennedy, founder of Ochre Sun

Venue 114 manager Louise Thompson said sustainability was “at the core of who we are and how we operate at Venue 114”.

“As one of only two venues on the Sunshine Coast which has acquired [EarthCheck Evaluate](https://earthcheck.org/products-services/certification/earthcheck-evaluate/)
&#x20;status, we continue to implement sustainability initiatives and endeavour to educate and empower our community by curating impactful *In Conversation* events,” Ms Thompson said.

Echoing the event’s theme, guests will enjoy the exquisite flavours of a local, seasonal, ethical and zero-waste menu curated by much-loved local caterers, Penfolds Catering.

Walk away inspired, with new connections, crafting your own story of purpose and supporting innovative, positive change.
