Diversity and inclusion are high priorities for Sunshine Coast Council.

That’s why during National Pride Month (June) Council will be showing its support at Sunshine Coast Mardi Gras.

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas said Council was committed to being a respectful and inclusive employer and champion of diversity and inclusivity.

“Council employees launched an internal Pride Network on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) in May, to show support to staff,’’ Ms Thomas said.

“Council is also taking part in the Sunshine Coast Mardi Gras event happening on June 10.

“Representatives from Council’s Pride Network and allies will be sharing information about the benefits of a career with Council and supporting diversity and inclusion in the region.

“If you’re attending the Mardi Gras event, be sure to see our Council team.

“Our amazing people create long lasting positive impact for our community. If you want to shape the region for the future, [join the team](https://careers.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
.

“You’ll be respected here at Council and your difference will be valued.”
