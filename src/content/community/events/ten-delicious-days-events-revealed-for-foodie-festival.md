Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the home-grown festival would be a tantalizing 10-day celebration of the region’s local produce.

“This culinary showcase’s point of difference was the stunning backdrops, set across the region’s diverse natural assets from the mountains to the sea,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“There’s plenty on offer with over 100 events showcasing more than 300 local producers and suppliers.

“Created by 52 local businesses and event organisers, I’m confident visitors and locals will be treated to some of the best food and tourism experiences in Australia at The Curated Plate on the Sunshine Coast.”

Locals and visitors are invited to immerse themselves in the flavours of the region and connect with growers, producers, and chefs through memorable and unique experiences. 

The Sunshine Coast’s newest airline BONZA will enable visitors from all over Australia to attend this year’s event via the region’s gateway, The Sunshine Coast Airport.

The Curated Plate is an event initiative of Sunshine Coast Council and supported by the Sunshine Coast Food and Agribusiness Network (FAN) and Visit Sunshine Coast.
