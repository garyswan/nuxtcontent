The all-ages festival in its milestone 15th year offers up plenty of performers for punters to enjoy again or see for the very first time at the beachside Kings Beach Amphitheatre from September 30 to October 2.

More than 500 applications were received, and a local panel of music industry peers worked their way through sound files, videos and bios to create an exceptional live playlist for the three-day music event.

Panel member and founder of Peace Run Records, Andrea Kirwin said she was grateful to be a part of the Caloundra Music festival consulting on their program this year.

“It was fantastic to see this level of community engagement and I’m looking forward to a great weekend of live music with some of Australia’s best entertainers,” Ms Kirwin said.

Coming from across the ditch will be eight-piece New Zealand band The Black Seeds (pictured above).

Their origins lie in the windy hills of Te Whanganui-aTara, Aotearoa (Wellington, New Zealand).

For nearly 25 years the group has crafted their own brand of South Pacific Soul, skilfully blending the deep grooves of reggae, funk, afrobeat and dub into an undeniably infectious mix that has embedded itself in Aotearoa's collective consciousness.

They last played CMF in 2016 and will for sure alight and delight audiences at CMF once again and push the creative boundaries of the Aotearoa roots sound.

Sunny Coast Rude Boys

Harry James Angus has gone solo (formerly with The Cat Empire) and released new music last year and will bring his serpentine sideways dance of drums, piano and trumpet with echo-chamber call-and-response vocals to the Soul stage on the Saturday.

Back on the CMF stage again, Lachy Doley, this time super-charged with an electric four-piece horn section, two amazing backing singers and some screaming blues guitar to create the Horns of Conviction. Other popular returns include Bearfoot, Burger Joint, Hot Potato Band, In2natioN and T H U M P.

August River Band, Fools, Hallie, Hope D, Horns of Leroy feat.Thando, Caitlyn Shadbolt & Melanie Dyer will all experience the CMF vibe for the first time.

Top talent from the Sunshine Coast will be on full show – Hayden Hack, JaZZella, Mason Hope and The Teachers, Sugarbag Blonde, and Sunny Coast Rude Boys to name a few.

The winners of Buskers by the Lake (August 19-21) will also join the line-up. As will winners from the Surge Highschool Rock Spectacular (August 17).

Announced in [May 2022](https://oursc.com.au/community/events/caloundra-music-festival-2022-stellar-first-artist-announcement)
&#x20;the top headliners offer an eclectic music experience with Art vs Science, Baker Boy, Ben Lee, Client Liaison, Coterie, Felivand, Missy Higgins, The Presets, The Regime, The Rolling Stones Revue (feat. Adalita, Sarah McLeod & Tim Rogers), Skunkhour, Vaudeville Smash and The Waifs.

[Tickets are on sale](https://caloundramusicfestival.com/)
&#x20;and festival lovers can go All-IN with a three-day pass. Great value for three days, three stages and 10 hours of live performance each day.

Keeping the reduced footprint and layout adopted in 2021, the venue offers an intimate music experience and punters are encouraged to buy tickets early or miss out.

CMF 2021

As their major fundraiser for 2022, Caloundra State Primary School is providing camping facilities during the Caloundra Music Festival on the school grounds. The four-hectare site is flat, open and elevated, with some beautiful shady sites, providing families an affordable accommodation option for the Caloundra Music Festival and managed to maintain a friendly feel.
