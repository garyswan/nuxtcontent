An exciting opportunity for local dancers is coming to Nambour through ‘Beyond’, a dance residency program supported by ArtsCoast and Punctum Inc.

From April 25 to May 16, council will host Lewis Major and company at its 2nd Space Dance Studio, where he’ll develop a new, major dance-theatre work.

The residency offers a range of opportunities to the local community including daily open classes for dance students and emerging professionals.
