The chance to witness stunning wildflowers in bloom during perfect Spring weather was a highlight from participants in this year’s Sunshine Coast Wildflower Festival.

Nearly 900 people enjoyed walks, journaling, arts and activities for Sunshine Coast’s Wildflower Festival 2022, which was held from August 20 to September 4.

The Wildflower Festival is an event that celebrates the seasonal change of spring with the beautiful wildflower displays that emerge across the Sunshine Coast landscape.

Kathleen McArthur, an artist, author, environmentalist and founding member of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, developed the festival in 1967. Since then it has grown into a much-anticipated annual event with local community groups hosting a number of activities.

This year, 28 free guided walks and activities were on offer. The public immersed themselves in natural areas between Bribie Island and Noosa National Park and discovered the diversity of local native, flowering plants.

Participants were engaged, learnt a lot, and thoroughly enjoyed getting outside in the perfect weather to experience the sensational wildflower blooms on show across the Coast.

**Activities included:**

*   Guided and self-guided walks with Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, Mooloolah River Landcare, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service Rangers, Noosa Integrated Catchment Association, Bribie Island Environmental Association, Noosa and District Landcare, Coolum and North Shore Coast Care, Friends of Ben Bennett Bushland Park, Friends of Keith Royal Park, and Wildflower Women;
*   Nature journaling and drawing with artist Petra Meer; and
*   The *xpollinate* artist in residency, workshops and exhibition at the Maroochy Botanic Gardens Arts and Ecology Centre.
