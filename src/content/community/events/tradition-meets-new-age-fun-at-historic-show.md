It dates back 117 years and is bursting with tradition, but this much-loved event also offers plenty of cutting-edge entertainment.

With show bags, side show alley, international horse whisperer Guy McLean and all of your show-time favourites, where else would you want to be on June 16-18 than at the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show?

Show Manager Penny Walsh said the 117th annual show was gearing up to be the biggest and best yet, with a unique mix of tradition and new-age entertainment at great value for money.

“For more than 100 years the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show has given local people and local businesses a platform to showcase their products, their animals and their amazing skills to our community,” she said.

“That wonderful and important tradition along with all the others people know and love will be back at the Nambour Showgrounds in 2023.

“Showgoers can experience high-octane V8 Supercars on the Saturday and Sunday and high adrenaline motorbikes with Aussie FMX stunt riders to the slower pace of the ferris wheel, fairy floss, a petting zoo, cattle judging, show jumping, wood chopping and of course the dagwood dogs.

“The gates will open at 9am on Friday June 16, a public holiday for the Sunshine Coast and ‘People’s Day’ at the Show.

“This year’s show will also feature a Freedom of Entry march on Saturday, June 17, involving the Australian Air Force Cadets Nambour Squadron.

“Around 200 cadets will march to the main gate of the showgrounds where they’ll be addressed by the Mayor and Queensland Police, as they request Freedom of Entry into Nambour as part of their 80th birthday celebrations.

“There will be a spectacular fireworks display on Friday and Saturday at 8pm and on Sunday evening at 7pm. 

“The price of entry to this year’s show is $25 for adults, $18 for students, while children under the age of five are free. There are some terrific discounts if you purchase tickets online through [www.sunshinecoastshow.com.au](http://www.sunshinecoastshow.com.au)
&#x20;(Adults $16, students $12) including fantastic family packages which are available exclusively online.”  

Discount tickets close midnight June 15.

Division 10 Councillor David Law said getting to and from this year’s show would be easy, with convenient public transport and parking options available.    

“Accessible parking is available, however other onsite parking will be limited, so visitors are encouraged to make use of the $5 public car parking at MacKellar Mining Depot on National Park Road opposite Ken Mills Toyota and at the Crushers Rugby League Club car park for $10,” Cr Law said.

“A free shuttle bus service will also run from the Nambour Train Station to the main gate throughout the day until after the fireworks in the evening.

“Council recently completed renewal works to the equestrian facilities as well as the access stairs and balustrade in the JD Grimes Grandstand, which look terrific and will also improve accessibility and safety for visitors to the showgrounds.”

Gates open from 9am each day. The show concludes each night at 10pm.
