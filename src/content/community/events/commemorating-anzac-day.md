Tomorrow (April 25) we remember those who have served to defend Australia.

RSL Australia are encouraging everyone to honour defence men and women in a way that is meaningful to them.

They are calling on all Australians to take the time to commemorate - whether at a march, an Anzac Day service or by lighting up the dawn at home.

**ANZAC BISCUITS RECIPE** *(thanks to [RSL Australia](https://lightupthedawn.com.au/blog/a-recipe-best-made-with-a-dash-of-humour)
)*

**INGREDIENTS**

*   1 cup plain flour
*   1 cup rolled oats
*   1 cup desiccated coconut
*   1 cup brown sugar
*   125g butter
*   1 tbsp golden syrup
*   1 tbsp hot water
*   1 tsp bicarb soda 

**METHOD**

1.  Preheat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius.
2.  Combine the flour, oats, coconut, and sugar in a large bowl. In a saucepan, melt the butter and then add the golden syrup. Bring it to the boil before removing it from the stove.
3.  Mix the hot water and bicarb soda and add it to the butter and syrup – it should froth up. Pour this into the dry ingredients and stir together. If the mixture is a little dry, add some water.
4.  Taking spoonfuls of the mixture, roll them into balls and put them on a greased baking tray, about 5cm apart. Use a fork to flatten them and then put them in the oven for 15 minutes or until they’re golden brown.
5.  Let them cool on the baking tray for about a minute, and then move them to a wire rack to cool properly.
