Unfortunately due to the predicted heavy rainfall and strong winds forecast, Sunshine Coast Council has made the difficult decision to postpone its Brisbane 2032 10 years to go [Mountain Bike Event](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/16259746-a/join-the-green-gold-runway-celebrating-mountain-biking?utm_source=Corporate&utm_medium=Spotlights&utm_campaign=Have+a+go+event)
&#x20;at Sugar Bag Road Mountain Bike Trails in Caloundra that was scheduled for this Saturday July 23.

The tracks will be extremely wet and combined with strong winds potentially up to 90 km/hour it’s not safe given there are lots of trees at this location and children would have been in attendance.

The good news is that this event is only postponed and will now be held on Sunday, August 7, for everyone to enjoy.

Those who have already registered will be contacted to advise their place will transfer over to August 7, but if they’re unavailable they can simply let us know.

The community will still be able to celebrate 10 years to go until Brisbane 2032 in a few weeks’ time and from children to seniors, beginners to pros, everyone is invited to join the fun and #HaveaGo at a free council community event in Caloundra on Sunday August 7. 

People can get on their bikes at Sugar Bag Road Mountain Bike Trails from 10am-3pm for an action-packed day of demos, trails, #HaveAGo sessions and rubbing shoulders with world-class champions.
