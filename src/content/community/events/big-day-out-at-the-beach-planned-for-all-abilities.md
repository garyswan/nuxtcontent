Sunshine Coast Council has joined forces with Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club to celebrate International Day of People with Disability on Friday, December 3, with a free family fun event for everyone to participate in and enjoy.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the All Access – Day at the Beach! event promoted the importance of accessibility on local beaches and across the Sunshine Coast.

“Council is very proud to shine a spotlight on the importance of inclusion in our community and also celebrate the many abilities and achievements of people with a disability,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Council is improving access and inclusion on the Sunshine Coast and has a firm history of doing so.

“In 2019 council expanded the Accessible Beaches Program to include four locations in the region including Coolum, Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba and Kings beaches. Operating this program is not possible without the collaboration with the Volunteer Surf Lifesaving Patrols at the Surf Life Saving Clubs.

“The Compass Institute Inc. joined the accessible beaches program in 2020, making a beach wheelchair available during business hours, year-round.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said focusing on the ability in a disability was crucial.

“There are more than 4.4 million people currently living with a disability in Australia,” Cr Law said.

“I encourage people to join in this fun event, challenge misconceptions about people with a disability and break down those barriers so together we thrive.

“Beaches present a number of difficulties for access due to the changing nature of the beach owing to tides and weather.

“But with accessible equipment including beach matting and beach wheelchairs, these barriers can be reduced and even removed so that people with disability can enjoy something many of us take for granted.”

Mooloolaba Surf Life Saving Club President Darryl Johnson said the club was thrilled to support the day.

**“**We pride ourselves on being the most inclusive beach on the Sunshine Coast so when council approached us about this event we were delighted to accept and host it at the iconic Mooloolaba Beach,” Mr Johnson said.

“We are looking forward to being part of this great community event that is not only a fun day out but promotes inclusion, diversity and beach access for all.”

Activities include volleyball, all-abilities rugby program, tai chi, seated Zumba, access mats, beach wheelchairs, a mobile hoist, sand and water play and Mooloolaba SLSC will be hosting a fundraising barbecue on the day.

This event is proudly supported by Steps, Bush Kids, Montrose, Equity Works, Mooloolaba Starfish Nippers, Collaborative Partnership, NDIS, QLD NRL (All abilities program), Sunshine Coast Council Libraries and Healthy Sunshine Coast.
