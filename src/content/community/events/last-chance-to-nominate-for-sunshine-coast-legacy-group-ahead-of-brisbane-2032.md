Just one week remains for Sunshine Coast residents to apply for the chance to be part of one of our region’s most important groups in the lead-up to the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With Sunshine Coast Council being a key delivery partner in the 2032 Games, the [Sunshine Coast Legacy Plan Community Reference Group](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Community-to-guide-Sunshine-Coast-legacy-from-the-Brisbane-2032-Olympic-and-Paralympic-Games)
&#x20;will help shape the region’s legacy plan over the next 10 years.

The Community Reference Group – to be chaired by two-time Paralympian and USC Public Health Lecturer Dr Bridie Kean – will work with council to identify key opportunities the region should pursue before, during and after the Games.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged the community to [apply now](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/community-venues-check)
&#x20;for a community-based voluntary position on the Community Reference Group, with applications closing on Thursday, February 10.

“Council has already received some great interest in this group, but we would like to hear further from key people including Olympians and Paralympians, those in the environment and sustainability sector, young people as well as people with a disability across the Sunshine Coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Our region has an incredible opportunity to create a lasting legacy that will benefit our community, our children and our children’s children for decades to come.

“This will be a collaborative partnership to develop a clear plan from which our community – our residents now and those who will live here in the future – will be the clear beneficiaries.

“Behind the excitement and cheers for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games will lie a legacy-driven focus anchored in sustainability, connectivity and liveability for our region.”

Community Reference Group Chair Dr Bridie Kean urged people to submit an EOI today.

“The Sunshine Coast is made up of some incredibly talented people who have a lot to offer, especially when it comes to influencing the outcomes from the greatest sporting event on Earth,” Dr Kean said.

“This is an amazing opportunity where collectively, the Community Reference Group can provide a powerful voice for our Sunshine Coast that captures ideas, hopes and aspirations from a variety of backgrounds, industries and sectors.”

Anyone living in the Sunshine Coast Council area who is interested in being considered is encouraged to apply to represent one of the following areas of interest:

*   Olympians / Paralympians
*   Environment and sustainability
*   Business and industry
*   Tourism
*   Community sector
*   Arts and Culture
*   Sport and active recreation
*   People with a Disability
*   Young people
*   Education and research sector.

Separate to this Expression of Interest process there will be two Traditional Custodian representatives on the reference group.

Simply submit your CV including your full residential address and answer the following questions in a one-page cover letter to: SCLegacyPlan\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au by 5pm Thursday, February 10, 2022.

*   Why are you interested in joining this Community Reference Group?
*   Which of the areas of interest nominated above do you consider you represent and what would you bring to the Community Reference Group in representing that area of interest?
*   Why do you believe getting the legacy plan right is important to the Sunshine Coast?
*   What is your availability (generally) to attend meetings on at least a monthly basis through the course of 2022?
