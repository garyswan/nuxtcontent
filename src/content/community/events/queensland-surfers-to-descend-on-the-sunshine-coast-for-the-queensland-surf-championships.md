The 2023 Queensland Surf Championships (QSC) is set to begin Monday 17 April, kicking off six days of surfing action on the Sunshine Coast. 

The six day event will feature some of Queensland’s top talent across multiple disciplines including shortboard, longboard, logger and Stand Up Paddle Board (SUP) surfing. A total of 44 titles will be up for grabs as competitors vie for selection into the Queensland team to compete at the Australian Surfing Titles later this year.

The 2023 QSC will commence with the SUP division on **Monday 17 April** where competitors can expect over half-a-metre of south-east swell.

Following the SUP surfers, the waves are expected to build significantly to approximately three metres of southerly swell and increasingly strong winds.

The event will conclude with the blue-ribbon Open Men and Women Shortboard divisions and the Open Masters on **Saturday 22 April.** They will display performance surfing at an elite level, whilst competing for a Queensland Title. 

The 2023 Queensland Surf Championships is proudly supported by Sunshine Coast Council, Queensland Government, Dritimes, We Are Feel Good Inc., QMS Media, The Point Coolum, GoPro and Travla.
