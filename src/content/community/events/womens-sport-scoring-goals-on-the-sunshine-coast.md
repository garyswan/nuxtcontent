The Sunshine Coast is shining a light on women’s sport in June with the nation’s leading rugby league, netball and water polo players converging on the same weekend (Friday 25 - Sunday 27 June) and a first for our region, hosting the Women In Sport Summit.

Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with Tourism & Events Queensland (TEQ), will host the Ministry of Sport’s third annual Women in Sport Summit at the University of the Sunshine Coast on 25 June, attracting some of the most prestigious names in the industry to provide exclusive access to coveted conversations and game-changing discussions.

Sunshine Coast Stadium at Bokarina will host the 2021 Ampol Women’s State of Origin on Friday 25 June, thanks to another partnership between council and TEQ. Gates open at 5pm with an under-19 match and the main game kicking off at 7.45pm. Tickets, starting from just $5, are available from [Ticketek](https://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=worigin21&utm_source=NRL&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=WSOO21)

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said hosting the trifecta of elite level sporting events in addition to the Women’s in Sports Summit was a coup for our region and showcased the terrific support that council and TEQ provided to women’s sport on the Sunshine Coast.

“This is an unprecedented culmination of talent coming together in our region at the same time,” Cr O’Pray said.

“We’re fortunate to host such a high level of expertise in our region all on the same weekend and that’s on top of our local legends who are filling the grandstands at local events across the region.

“Our council is thrilled to support active lifestyles for everyone across the Coast and we especially want to encourage women of all ages to participate, and where possible, achieve great things for themselves and as representatives of our beloved Sunshine Coast. We know when young girls and women see what’s possible on the national stage, they’re motivated to perform at their best.

“Hosting elite sporting events provides tremendous opportunity to showcase our region and confirms the Sunshine Coast’s reputation as a world sporting event and tourism destination.

“We hope that athletes, supporters, administrators and summit participants take away a wonderful experience and come back again soon.”  

The Women in Sport Summit and Women’s State of Origin are supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland, and feature on the *It’s Live! in Queensland* events calendar.

It is expected this showcase of Women’s Sport will be attended by more than 13,500 people and is supported through partnerships between the Sunshine Coast Council, Tourism and Events Queensland, Ministry of Sport and the Commonwealth and Queensland Government under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements.
