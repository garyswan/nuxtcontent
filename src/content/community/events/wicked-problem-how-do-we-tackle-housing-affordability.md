In a time when housing affordability is impacting residents and communities across the region, a team of industry leaders is about to bring vital creative solutions to the table in a one-off panel event.

The *Affordable Housing: A Wicked Problem* event on June 1 brings together expertise from housing developers, economists and town planners in a panel discussion on the causes and potential actions to address the nation’s housing crisis.

### **Save the date:**

#### **When:** Thursday, June 1, 4.30pm registrations before presentations begin 5pm

#### **Where:** The MET, Maroochydore

#### **Cost:** Tickets $20, including catering by Thistle and Woods

Experts refer to a lack of affordable housing as a “wicked problem” because it is complex and multi-dimensional, with no easy or obvious solutions.

To tackle the issue from a multi-disciplinary approach, the panel will include PRD Real Estate Chief Economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo, Churchill Fellow and Civity town planner and director Martin Garred, Nightingale Housing CEO Dan McKenna and BlueCHP Executive Manager Darren Mew.

### During the evening, panel members will discuss:

*   The wider economic context to the housing affordability crisis
*   Research into land use planning recommendations to increase housing diversity and affordability
*   Two visionary affordable and sustainable housing models by Nightingale Housing and BlueCHP.
