Football Queensland (FQ) has confirmed the details of the 2022 FQ Community Cup, to be held from Tuesday, 20 September to Friday, 23 September at Maroochydore FC on the Sunshine Coast.

Delivered in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council and Visit Sunshine Coast, the four-day event will welcome over 700 junior boys and girls from across all ten regions in Queensland to compete against each other.

“Football Queensland is pleased to announce the details of the 2022 FQ Community Cup which we’re excited to deliver in partnership with Sunshine Coast Council and Visit Sunshine Coast,” FQ President Ben Richardson said.

“The tournament is a highlight of the Queensland football calendar, bringing together players, coaches and referees from across the state as well as their families who can not only enjoy the action on the pitch, but can also explore the many visitor attractions on the Sunshine Coast during their stay.”

The state-wide carnival will feature age groups of U13, U14, and U15/16 for boys, as well as U13/14 and U15/16/17 for girls.

“The FQ Community Cup is a valuable development opportunity not only for our junior players but for young referees as well, by providing the experience to referee at a carnival and receive mentoring from high level officials,” FQ CEO Robert Cavallucci said.

“With over 1,500 visitors expected to attend and MiniRoos and Walking Football sessions running alongside matches, there will be football fun for the whole family and an opportunity for everyone to get involved.

“On behalf of Football Queensland, I’d like to acknowledge and thank Sunshine Coast Council, Visit Sunshine Coast and Maroochydore FC for their support in planning and delivering this year’s FQ Community Cup.

“The Sunshine Coast is a premier sports destination and is home to many attractions bound to keep families busy during the four-day tournament.

“We’re excited to partner with the Council and Visit Sunshine Coast to deliver this event in the region, and look forward to welcoming members of our football community to the beautiful Sunshine Coast this September.”

Expressions of Interest for the FQ Community Cup are now live for players, coaches and volunteers interested in participating at the tournament.
