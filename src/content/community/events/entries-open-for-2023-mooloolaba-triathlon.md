One of the Sunshine Coast’s most popular events will be back in action next March with entries now open for the 2023 Mooloolaba Triathlon.

The Mooloolaba Triathlon welcomes thousands of participants to the region each year, with next year’s event to take place between 10-12 March 2023.

More than 5,500 athletes headed to Mooloolaba for two days of racing this year, with first time triathletes, veterans of the sport and rising stars mixing together on course.

Geoff Meyer, Managing Director for The IRONMAN Group in Oceania, said the event continues to go from strength to strength.

“It’s great to see the Mooloolaba Triathlon continue grow over the years to become one of the highlights of the Sunshine Coast events calendar,” said Meyer. “From its first running back in 1993 with 255 individual competitors and 74 teams, to this year where we celebrated its 30th anniversary and welcomed more than 5,500 athletes and over 600 volunteers, the Mooloolaba Triathlon is an event not to miss. 

“This event is accessible to so many people, with the event featuring a great mix of new-comers and those who are already involved in the sport,” he said. “We’re looking forward to welcoming athletes from across the country, and from around the world for the first time since 2020, back to Mooloolaba next March.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said the Mooloolaba Triathlon continued to be one of our longest running council sponsored events on the Sunshine Coast.

“New generations sign up each year and thousands of triathletes keep coming back, which suggests the overall experience is highly anticipated on the tri calendar,” he said.

“We appreciate the event organiser’s efforts to work with our business community, our residents and all the local event volunteers who welcome these elite athletes to our region for the weekend.”

Saturday will see the Sprint Triathlon take place, which offers a great opportunity for a mix of people to take part, whether you’re a beginner keen for your first triathlon, or an experienced athlete who wants to race yourself against the clock. The Sprint Triathlon consists of a 750m swim, 20km ride and 5km run, finishing on the Mooloolaba Esplanade.

The Standard Triathlon will take place on Sunday 12 March, with triathletes taking on a 1.5km swim, 40km ride and 10km run. Sunday’s event will also include a relay option for those wanting to enter as a team.

The Mooloolaba Triathlon is supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland and features on the *It’s Live! in Queensland* events calendar.
