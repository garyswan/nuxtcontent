COMING SOON: 40 international and national entrants prepare to take to the catwalk reminiscent of the Met Gala or Paris Fashion Week runways.

With dates set for 11-12 August 2023 at Venue 114, the Australian Wearable Art Festival is emerging as one of the must-attend arts events in the country and has just secured two of the most exciting artists to judge this unique genre - where fashion and art converge.

Brisbane local, Bethany Cordwell, was an easy choice to welcome to the judging panel.

Ms Cordwell achieved international notoriety when Beyoncé wore her black and white bodysuit made out of 55,000 hand cut plastic office binders for the Renaissance album artwork in 2022 and then using this technique she went on to win the Avant Garde category at last year’s World of Wearable Art Festival (WOW).

“Wearable art is such a unique platform where sculptural form, technique, wearability and the ‘wow’ factor all play such an important part in delivering a winning piece,” said Ms Cordwell.    

“Garments exhibited at the festival are crafted from a range of unlikely materials, including in the past ring pull tabs, bicycle tires, flowers, teabags, feathers, and all sorts of found or repurposed objects, which have been transformed into avant-garde pieces.

“Wearable art's popularity is evident in recent fashion and arts trends, such as the acclaimed Alexander McQueen exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria.

"McQueen, a highly original fashion designer, showcased the connection between fashion and art through his innovative collections.

“WOW is the largest wearable art event in the world and sees more than 60,000 people attend each year with nearly $28 million contributed to the local Wellington economy.”

Fifi Colston, a world-class artist and creative from Wellington, New Zealand, brings her award-winning expertise as an illustrator, writer, and costume and props maker to the AWAF judging panel.

Ms Colston said wearable art's evolution reflects the ever-changing landscape of artistic expression, embracing unconventional materials, techniques, and concepts to challenge traditional notions of fashion and personal adornment.

“I have been creating wearable art for more than 25 years and over that time, I have watched designers move away from largely costume based, fairly literal solutions and instead use the medium as an exciting canvas for both performance and static exhibition,” said Ms Colston.

“The application of traditional art practice and the incorporation of new technologies makes for innovative thinking and construction.

“I see designers exploring the vast potential of form, texture, colour, and materials. Electronics, 3D printing and digital art along with thoughtful exploration into found materials allows for huge innovations in the creative process.

“It’s an exciting time for wearable art designers as they push the boundaries of art, fashion and costume design.”

Festival curator, Wendy Roe, said she is proud the event stands at the forefront of the Australian wearable art movement, providing a platform for artists and designers to showcase their creations.

“The festival features four main categories: Trashion, Sustainable Nature, Floriana, and Avant Garde, along with recognising an overall winner, emerging artist, best representation of haute-couture and the best headpiece,” said Ms Roe.

“Last year's Avant Garde and Supreme Winners, Evita Camilleri and Dan Draper, captivated the audience with their innovative sculptural artworks made from garden hose and cable ties. This talented duo returns as finalists, generating anticipation for their upcoming presentation.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said it was great to see the Australian Wearable Art Festival attracting such esteemed artists for the judging panel.

“Our goal as a major event sponsor is to attract visitors to our region for memorable experiences, and this event will definitely be one to remember," Cr O'Pray said.

“If you haven’t been to the AWAF before, you’ll be absolutely amazed at the weird and wonderful creations that come out on the wearable art catwalk."

This year's event will feature 40 national and international works showcased on a 27-metre long catwalk spanning three shows.

The finalists represent diverse locations, including Poland, Germany, the United States, Queensland, and other parts of Australia, reflecting the festival's growing international appeal.
