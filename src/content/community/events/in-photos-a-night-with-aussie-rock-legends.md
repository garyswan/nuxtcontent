At last, *Noiseworks* returned to the stage after 30 years as part of their aptly named *Take Me Back Tour*.

Fans packed out Venue 114 to see the rockers play all their classic hits, including *Touch, No Lies*, *Hot Chilli Woman* and, of course ,*Take Me Back,* alongside other  favourites.

The group dedicated the tour to their guitarist Stuart “Chet” Fraser who passed away in 2019.

In a tribute to Chet, former *Southern Sons* frontman, Jack Jones, joined the band.
