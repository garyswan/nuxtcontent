Due to the forecast winter wet weather, the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival, scheduled for this Saturday, July 2, has been postponed.

The community event was to be part of the new Mooloolaba Northern Parkland’s grand opening celebrations.

Organised by the Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce with the support of Sunshine Coast Council, the festival promised oceans of free family-friendly fun along the Esplanade – but sadly the festivities have now been put on hold.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said while he was disappointed the event had to be postponed, the difficult decision was made so organisers could advise local businesses, stallholders and ride operators as soon as possible.  

“The new Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival is an important event for Council, and for Mooloolaba,” Cr Natoli said.

“While I’m disappointed we had to postpone the festival, I encourage the community to come down and visit Mooloolaba’s new Northern Parkland no matter what the weather.

“Grab a coffee, stroll the shops or settle in for a long-lunch at one of the many cafes and restaurants along the Esplanade.

“You also have the Curated Plate to look forward to in July, the Sunshine Coast Marathon in August, the 2022 Ironman and Luna Festival in September, Beach Rugby in November and many more major Mooloolaba events on the horizon.

“I’d also like to thank the community for their overwhelming support for the new Northern Parkland to date.

“It has been wonderful to see so many people enjoying the new adventure playground, coastal pathways and viewing decks.”

Council will keep the community informed on the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival’s new date.
