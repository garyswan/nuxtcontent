Did you know there is a ClimateWatch trail in the southern section of Kawana Forest Bushland Reserve?

Situated north of Meridan Plains, the trail begins in a flooded gum forest and leads users through a paperbark forest later on.

Photographs of animals and plants can be taken on your phone and uploaded onto the ClimateWatch app, which will be used to help shape the countryâ€™s scientific response to climate change.

The trail runs for 2km and can take almost an hour to walk the loop depending on how many animal plants species you record.

You simply need to download the *ClimateWatch* app and register yourself to begin taking observations on the platform.

For more information, you can download the free app from your app store or head to:\ <https://www.climatewatch.org.au/trails/queensland/sunshine-coast-kawana-forest-qld>
