Sun, Surf and Soul return to Kings Beach in 2021 with the Caloundra Music Festival taking place 1 to 3 October.

Caloundra Music Festival has provided a place for families and friends to come together in celebration, showcasing Caloundra to visitors from around the country since 2007.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said a revised format for 2021 aimed to increase the safety of our patrons, artists, crew, volunteers, vendors, staff and community.

“We are excited to engage with our festival family again and provide some much anticipated entertainment over the October long weekend,” Cr Landsberg said.

“For what will be the last long weekend of the year in Queensland, I encourage people to book their accommodation early and make a weekend of it here in Caloundra and the Sunshine Coast area, as we have plenty of attractions and activities to enjoy.”

The festival offers exposure for local performers and work opportunities for a range of local event and technical crew.

Festival Director Richie Eyles said he was pleased to start negotiations with performers and suppliers after COVID-19 caused the festival’s cancellation in 2020.

The event will operate in accordance with a Queensland Health-approved COVID Safe Event Plan.

The festival will be presented in a revised format, including a reduced crowd capacity and will be held over three days with a genre-specific theme each day.

Artist applications are open and event organisers will progressively call for food vendors and volunteers over the coming months.

The Caloundra Music Festival is an event initiative of Sunshine Coast Council and supported by the Queensland Government through Tourism and Events Queensland. This event features on the It’s Live! in Queensland events calendar, which is expected to deliver $215 million for the state’s economy in the first half of 2021.
