Thousands of music lovers, local artists and businesses will be cheering after a much-loved Sunshine Coast event was secured for another three years to 2025.

The Caloundra Music Festival, which attracts fans and musicians from far and wide, injects more than $3 million into the local economy each year.

At its February Ordinary Meeting, council heard the festival continued to provide affordable, family-friendly entertainment to a broad demographic, performance opportunities for local artists and support for charities, venues, businesses, accommodation providers and schools.

The event also promotes accessibility, diversity and inclusivity and helps bind the community, attracting more than 500 volunteers.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said the festival was a much-loved event that was great for the region.

“Delivering this festival fosters economic benefits, cultural development and community outcomes, and continues to evolve environmental sustainability,” Cr Landsberg said.

“We have plenty of achievements to show over the past 15 years, from infrastructure improvements around Kings Beach Parklands, to showcasing our very own local high school students on the festival stage and helping Caloundra State School’s Parents and Friends Association raise thousands of dollars for school programs.

“With all the challenges faced by the industry – the COVID-19 pandemic, weather events, financial challenges and venue closures – it’s important now, more than ever, that we get behind this festival.

“Our festival provides real opportunities for emerging Sunshine Coast musicians to perform in a world-class environment alongside major international and national artists.”

The 2022 festival celebrated 15 years at the iconic beachside location of Kings Beach.

Attendees came from every state in Australia and also New Zealand, enjoying the three-day event which showcased 70 artists, including 30 local acts.

Meridan State College band ‘Lamkin Lane’, winners of the SURGE high school rock spectacular, performed at their first-ever music festival.

Coast businesses advertised for free to patrons using the festival app and a large number of contracts were awarded to local suppliers.

Sunshine Coast Youth Council, YouTurn and Headspace worked with festival organisers to create a youth zone used as a chill out space.

An integral part of the festival’s delivery has been a focus on sustainability and, in 2022, more than 80% of all waste generated by the festival was diverted away from landfill.

Real progress has been made in building sustainability and the next stage will be measuring water, energy and visitor activities to determine carbon emissions.

The Caloundra Music Festival aims to build on the Sunshine Coast’s environmental credentials with the goal of becoming the region’s first carbon net zero music event by 2027.

Artist applications are now open for the spring festival, which will run from September 29 to October 1, 2023.
