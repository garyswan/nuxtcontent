Step inside Fantasyland as **over 250** of the world's most mystifying performers showcase their out-of-this-world skills at this year’s multi-award winning **Buskers By The Lake**. 

Returning to the Sunshine Coast from **Friday 19 - Sunday 21 August,** this multi-day, multi-event festival boasts a highly curated and completely unmissable lineup of local and interstate performers. From **record breaking stunts** to **sideshow sensations, contortionists** to **world-class musicians**, there's never a dull moment at Buskers By the Lake. 

Celebrating a second year at its new home, Buskers by the Lake has quickly cemented itself as one of the Sunshine Coast’s most sensational weekends. A stunning, sun-soaked, family-friendly extravaganza, festival go-ers can once again look forward to strolling along the idyllic Lake Kawana, while supporting their favourite Buskers. Organisers have worked hard to keep ticket prices low to encourage tipping and every cent from cash tips will go directly to each artist.

Living up to this year’s ‘Fantasyland’ theme, festival organisers today offer the very first sneak-peek into the myriad of magical performers gracing Sportsman’s Parade. By popular demand, Australia's most prolific sideshow performer, **The****Space Cowboy**, will be serving up his death defying show featuring sword swallowing, chainsaw juggling and unicycle knife throwing. Tasmania's stretchy and freaky sweet-heart of sideshow, **Samora Squid** is ready to turn heads with his unique blend of contortion, sword-swallowing and punk singing. Multi-award winning circus performer, **Hannah Cryle**, will run circles around Sunny Coast crowds as she spins, rolls and contorts herself through a giant metal ring. 

Ready to bust a move? Internationally acclaimed break dance crew, **Floorlegendz** will be touching down from Sydney to show off their edgy power moves. Those seeking a dose of music, dance and art can experience all three, as Gold Coast artist **Anthony Pieters** mesmerises with his unique craft. Making its triumphant and highly-requested return to Buskers by the Lake is the iconic floating half-pipe, set to come alight with a spectacular fire finale at sunset, courtesy of pyro professors **Energy Entertainment.**

A feast for all the senses, Buskers by the Lake is set to tantalise those tastebuds with the crowd favourite **Enchanted** and **Bohemian Bars** as well as a roster of delicious festival eats. 

Keep those good times rolling by exploring the selection of sideshows that complete the Buskers by the Lake program. Find a new favourite muso as the country's best emerging singer-songwriters go head to head at ‘**Battle of the Buskers**’ - previously won by Aussie fave Tones and I. Thillseekers and adrenaline junkies can catch the death-defying and side-splitting cabaret, ‘**Deja Voodoo – Resurrection**’. Finally, there’s no reason for the fun to end when the sun sets! Revel in the 18+ **Sundowner Celebration** on both Saturday and Sunday evening as the festival’s 'Enchanted Bar' transforms into an out-of-this-world party paradise. 

Festival Organiser, Cindy Jensen, explains that Buskers by the Lake would not be possible without the overwhelming support from the Sunshine Coast community. "We wouldn’t be celebrating our ninth year if it wasn’t for the support of our sponsors and partners and it’s because of them that we can continue to welcome a sea of smiles come show day!" 

Sunshine Coast Council Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said last year's Buskers By The Lake was a great attraction for visitors to plan a week or long weekend away to enjoy the Sunshine Coast and experience some eclectic, creative and authentic entertainment. “This festival appeals to such a wide attendee demographic, where inclusivity and diversity have a strong emphasis from both a performer and attendee perspective,” Cr O’Pray said. “We want to be the region where bright new talent is discovered, with the event being a launching pad for young and budding performers.”

Intent on giving back to the community, this year, Buskers by the Lake is partnering with **The Starlight Foundation,** donating 10% of ticket proceeds to the not-for-profit. "We also want to create happiness for those who are unable to make it lakeside," states Cindy Jensen. "The Starlight Foundation has been a charity of choice of mine for many years, so this partnership made total sense!" 

There's no better time to snap up those tickets! For a short time only, festival organisers will be waving their magic wands and granting early-bird weekend passes for the price of single day tickets.
