The South Sydney Rabbitohs, alongside Sunshine Coast Council and Tourism and Events Queensland (TEQ), have today launched their 2021 NRL Premiership match to be played against the New Zealand Warriors on Saturday 24 July at 3pm at Sunshine Coast Stadium.

This will be the second time in three seasons that the Rabbitohs have taken on the Warriors at Sunshine Coast Stadium after last year’s event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It’s all systems go in 2021 and the anticipation is building amongst the Rabbitohs who enjoyed their time on the Sunshine Coast in 2021.

“We’re all excited to be returning to Sunshine Coast Stadium in July. It promises to be a fantastic event once again,” Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly said.

“There is a lot of work being put in now to make sure the event is as successful as it was in 2019 and the people of the Sunshine Coast get to see some of the best players in the game on their home turf. Our Members and supporters also loved the opportunity to visit one of the most beautiful regions in Australia.

“We’re looking forward to bringing Latrell Mitchell, Cody Walker, Adam Reynolds, Benji Marshall, Cameron Murray, Campbell Graham, Josh Mansour and Thomas Burgess to the Sunshine Coast, as well as proud Queenslanders Jai Arrow and, of course, our coach Wayne Bennett. The Warriors will also bring superstars such as Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, David Fusitu’a, Tohu Harris and Reece Walsh to the Sunshine Coast so it promises to be a cracking game of footy in a region that loves its Rugby League.

“Mayor (Mark) Jamieson and the team at Sunshine Coast Council, along with the team at TEQ, are an enthusiastic and dynamic team to work with. We’re really looking forward to contributing to the local community and economy when we arrive in July.”

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor, Jason O’Pray, said council is very proud of its partnership with the South Sydney Rabbitohs that kicked off in 2019 and will see the club play one of its home NRL fixtures here at Sunshine Coast Stadium this year and in 2022 as well. 

“After a sell-out match in 2019, we’re so excited to welcome the Rabbitohs and New Zealand Warriors back to the Sunshine Coast and we’re also looking forward to hosting another strong contingent of Rabbitohs and Warriors supporters at Sunshine Coast Stadium on Saturday 24 July,” Cr O’Pray said.

“The Sunshine Coast is a terrific place to visit all year round and I’m sure Rabbitohs and Warriors fans from interstate will be keen to sample some of our magnificent winter weather and all that our region has to offer.

“Rugby League has an extremely strong supporter base in our region and I know how excited local footy fans are to see the NRL return to Sunshine Coast Stadium in 2021. So I would urge everyone who is keen to get a ticket for this match to jump onto Ticketek as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. You’d hate to miss another nail-biter like the one we had here when these two teams met in 2019!”

Tickets for the Rabbitohs vs Warriors clash go on sale to Rabbitohs Members on Monday 31 May at 10am, and to the general public on Thursday 3 June at 10am, via [Ticketek](https://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/Show.aspx?sh=RBS1921)
