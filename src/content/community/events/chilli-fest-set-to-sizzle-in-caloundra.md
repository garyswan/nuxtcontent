Burning through downtown Caloundra the IGNITE Chilli Festival returns to Bulcock Street and Happy Valley on Saturday 12 June.

A great day out for the whole family, this FREE event kicks off at 10am and will feature an array of chilli inspired food, products, produce and cooking demonstrations, as well as local live music, market stalls and roving entertainment.

Australia’s favourite larrikin fishing presenter Scott Hillier (Creek to Coast) will hold his very own cooking demonstrations and co-host the Hot 91 Chilli Cook Off with local radio presenter Sam Coward, followed by Caloundra’s inaugural HOT 91 waiters’ race to find the fastest waiter in town!

From 4pm the hot entertainment moves to Happy Valley Park with live music from soulful songstress Lisa Hunt, DISCOTrain and the Rock N Roll Boys,  plus dance demonstrations by Cool Cats Rock ‘n’ Roll.

The IGNITE Chili Festival will run in conjunction with the 2021 annual Ryno Downunder Beachfest (11-13 June) which showcases a must-see collection of classic cars in downtown Caloundra.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said it would be great to see the Caloundra community embrace the return of the Chilli Festival after its huge success in 2018.

“The IGNITE Chilli Festival is a great supporting event for the Ryno Downunder Beachfest,which brings more than 1,000 visitors to the region, making it a fantastic opportunity to showcase our local produce, products and performers,” Cr Landsberg said.

“With both events operating in reduced capacities and different formats to pre-COVID, there is still a need to spread the audience across multiple activities and locations.”

Chillies, herbs and spices through a fusion of food, music and people makes the 2021 IGNITE Chilli Festival almost too hot to handle.
