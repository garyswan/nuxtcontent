A new era, a special birthday and a thank you – Sunshine Coast Council is celebrating them all in Landsborough with a [street festival](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/programs-and-events/landsborough-museum-street-festival)
&#x20;the whole family will enjoy.

From heritage talks, classic cars, cake and craft to face-painting, exhibitions and storytelling, the free festival on Saturday, May 13, will have something for everyone. Celebrations will start at 10am in the heart of the Landsborough township and continue until 2pm.

Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said the street festival marked several exciting milestones in the hinterland town.

“We’re re-launching the [state-heritage-listed Landsborough Historic Museum](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/landsborough-museum/visit)
 as a free-to-enter council managed facility to tell the continuous social history of the region to the region and its visitors; it's cemented its place as the premier social history museum on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Over the past 12 months, staff and volunteers have been cataloguing, interpreting, and managing the collection, which was [gifted to council](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/news/A-new-era-for-the-Landsborough-museum)
&#x20;by the Landsborough and District Historical Society in 2022.

“Visitors can now enjoy extended opening hours from 10am – 3pm, Wednesday to Sunday as well as an exciting and varied range of monthly events, workshops, and kids’ activities.

“The festival also marks the 50th anniversary of the Landsborough and District Historical Society, an organisation, which has made such a wonderful contribution to the region's heritage over the past five decades.

“And finally, the celebration, acknowledges all the volunteers who have helped maintain and interpret the museum and its collections, and who will continue to play an important role in helping provide support and research advice to the museum and the community.

“It is only because of the dedication and research of these volunteers, and their predecessors, that the significant collection of more than 14,000 objects is catalogued, allowing us to interpret, continue to collect and share these incredible local stories”

The historic 1924 Landsborough Shire Council Chambers is a state heritage-listed building and was the former chambers for the Landsborough Shire Council until 1967.

The collection itself provides a fascinating insight into the lives of Sunshine Coast residents through the lens of farming, industry, tourism, transport and communication.

Sunshine Coast Council Coordinator Heritage Services Peter Connell said the event was being held during Australian Heritage Month, which for 2023 had the theme ‘Sharing Stories’.

“As [stories](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stories)
&#x20;are such a vital part of understanding our heritage, we’ll be offering a range of heritage talks during the festival, providing an opportunity for diverse voices to share information and build connections,” Mr Connell said.

“And if anyone attending the festival would like to become a heritage volunteer, I’d encourage them to either chat to staff on the day or visit the [heritage website](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/about/volunteer)
&#x20;for more information.”

&#x20;President Graeme Goss encouraged visitors to visit the book tent at the festival and find out more about the society.

“We’re proud we are of this area and a part of the stories that make up the history of our community and we look forward to continuing to tell those stories for many years to come,” Mr Goss said.

“Anyone with an interest in local history is more than welcome to join the society or volunteer on the committee.”

This event is supported by the [Sunshine Coast Arts and Heritage Levy](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/about/arts-and-heritage-levy)
.
