From sixth on the ladder to bouncing their way to a spot in the Queensland AFL Grand Final this weekend, the Maroochydore Roos are just days away from contesting their first state premiership in the club’s history.

Under the guidance of Roos’ coach Andrew Cadzow, the team beat Labrador Tigers at the weekend, 81-72, scoring an impressive four goals in the final four minutes and booking a battle against the Broadbeach Cats on Saturday at Southport.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson wished the Roos every success on their path to glory.

“It’s incredible that this is only the Roos’ second season in the state league and in such a short time they’ve made it to the grand final,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“We wish them all the very best and hope they bring home the trophy.”

The club plays and trains at Council’s [Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Sports-and-Leisure/Sports-Complexes-and-Fields/Maroochydore-Multi-Sports-Complex)
&#x20;which is their home base.

Maroochydore Roos Club President Matt Bury said it was amazing for the team to make it so far in the top AFL competition in the state. 

“We made finals in our first year and we lost in an elimination final but now we’ve made it to the grand final, it’s incredible,” Mr Bury said.

“We’re predominately a volunteer community football club competing against all the big clubs.

“We’ve been at the Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex for more than a decade. That’s been our home base.

“We’ve got a tight-knit group and this is something they’ll talk about for years to come. Overall, this will be the sixth time our men’s senior team has made it to a grand final in seven years which is amazing.”

People can watch the Roos in action this Saturday at 2.30pm online here: <https://www.aflq.com.au/QAFL-live/>
