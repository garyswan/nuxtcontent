Don’t be a shroom these holidays! If you’re looking for something Fun(gi) to do with the family, get outdoors and head up to Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve for the new Fungi for Life exhibition.

It’s a mush-do!

Explore the larger-than-life fungi models, discover which fungus wins the stinky award, create your own fungi forest or borrow a junior ranger kit to observe fungi on the track.

WHEN: From Monday, 5 December, open 9.30am-3.30pm daily (closed Christmas Day and Boxing Day).

WHERE: Rainforest Discovery Centre at the Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve, 148 Mountain View Rd, Maleny QLD 4552.
