The Sunshine Coast is where you can find Australia’s largest busking festival this year, the place to discover the undiscovered.

Set to hit the Sunshine Coast this October, the multi-award-winning event is unique in its’ entirety and celebrated for breaking boundaries, attempting world records and providing opportunity for anyone despite their age, ability or disability.

From comedy to circus stunts, from award-winning musicians and talented teens, from swing to sword swallowing, Buskers by the Lake has an incredible entertainment line-up already signed within their four special events.

The signature event Battle of the Buskers will showcase emerging talent who will go guitar to banjo and face-off in the ultimate showdown of busking brilliance. Eleven Dive Bar, the newest live music venue in Maroochydore will be where you can show your support. 

Sunshine Coast local Morgan Smith (pictured) is one of many budding buskers who'll be vying for a finalist place in the inaugural under 18 singer-songwriter comp.

Not only will there be a floating skateboard ramp spectacle on Lake Kawana, the festival hub around the foreshore will host hundreds of street performers, the Heartlands Bar and plenty of colourful, creative festival food varieties.

This year’s program also includes the Halloween inspired freak show, ‘Deja Voodoo’ hosted by celebrity side show performer Space Cowboy.  Halloween lovers can jump aboard the voodoo train with the 55 x Guinness World Record Holder as he presents his devilish cast in a Halloween Shock Show at Venue 114.

Talent applications are still open for a limited time, so if you think you’ve got what it takes to wow a crowd register now.
