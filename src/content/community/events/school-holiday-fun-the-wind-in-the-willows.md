The family favourite *The Wind in the Willows* has been re-imagined with original music and exciting antics ready to entertain and inspire children this school holidays.

This delightful story performing at The Events Centre, Caloundra on Wednesday 28 September features Queensland professional performers bringing four animal character friends; Moley, Ratty, Badger and the often-mischievous Mr Toad.

Mr Toad's insatiable need for speed triggers a daring adventure as he discovers motor cars and the thrill of the open road. His friends, Ratty, Moley and Badger try to stop his reckless and destructive ways encouraging him to be a sensible Toad. 

Meanwhile, his home Toad Hall is invaded by the wild-wooders. His friends step up to help going into battle to evict the invaders and recapture Toad Hall.

These loveable characters navigate adventures and escapades on stage, delivering to young audiences inspiring messages about friendship, the consequences of actions and when the going gets tough, it’s friends that matter most.

RAVA Productions’ *The Wind in the Willows* is directed by Alison Vallette and produced by Ruth Atkinson. Cast members composed original music and through collaboration create their playful whimsical characters bursting with imagination and excitement.

Recommended for children prep to year 3, this show is sure to be enjoyed by the whole family.
