The long-range forecast is for fun, flashbacks and fashion when ABC’s revered weather presenter Jenny Woodward brings her spectacular one-woman stage show to Caloundra later this month.

Weathering Well is a potted history of the life and times of the popular presenter who chalks up 35 years with the national broadcaster in 2021.

Combining comedy, live music, video projections and a killer script with Jenny’s natural wit and charm, Weathering Well is an 80-minute autobiographical theatre experience with a high probability of intriguing anecdotes and behind-the-scenes revelations.

While the spotlight is firmly trained on the first lady of meteorology, Jenny will be joined on stage by Luke Volker on keyboard underscoring the show, to give the event a theatrical edge.

“I’m also going to talk about hairstyles and fashion and how they’ve changed over the years and I’ve got some fairly startling photos which I am going to share. There’s a lot of, “oh my God, what was I thinking?!” Jenny said.

Audiences might even get to see Jenny sing, “I guess I had always felt that I hadn’t fulfilled my stage career and I got to that point in my life where I thought, if I don’t do this now, I’m never going to do it."

Don’t miss this exciting, entertaining look behind-the-scenes with a veteran of Australian television, live on stage at The Events Centre, Caloundra.
