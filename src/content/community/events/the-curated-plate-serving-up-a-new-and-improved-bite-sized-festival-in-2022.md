Calling all foodies and culinary experts! From July 29 to August 7, local restaurants, farms, tourism and event operators will throw open their doors as part of The Curated Plate culinary festival, and offer the best of the Sunshine Coast’s local food and beverage experiences across a 10-day period.

Following the event’s cancellation in 2020 and 2021 due to the impacts of the pandemic, Sunshine Coast Council’s Economic Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said council would deliver The Curated (side) Plate – a 2022 Bite-Sized Serving, setting out to support and promote the region’s local food and agribusiness, hospitality, tourism and event industries.

“It’s The Curated Plate – but not quite as we knew it before,” Cr O’Pray said.

“In a post-pandemic environment, the event aims to ‘build from the ground up’ via a local industry-driven program, featuring the Sunshine Coast’s vast array of producers, restaurants and cafes, tourism and event experiences, and farm-gate activities. Businesses participate for free and retain all of the derived income.

“We all know how important it is to support local businesses and producers on the Sunshine Coast and this event is a fantastic way to showcase the incredible food, lifestyle and experiences our region has to offer.”

Expression of Interest registrations are now open until April 26, with businesses invited to put forward creative local food and beverage offerings which highlight the region’s talent and natural assets.

A designated local program co-ordinator has been engaged to liaise directly with participating businesses over the coming months, including offering information sessions on the coast and in the hinterland.

Fellow Economic Portfolio Councillor Terry Landsberg said council’s investment in the event promoted the Sunshine Coast as a food tourism destination, by attracting locals and visitors to enjoy superb local produce and ‘winter sun’ activities among our stunning hinterland and coastal settings.

“We’re looking forward to seeing an incredible program brimming with unique culinary experiences from across the region,” Cr Landsberg said.

“There really will be something for all – locations, activities, menus and price points to suit everyone, and many hidden gems to surprise visitors and locals.”

Food and Agribusiness Network (FAN) CEO Emma Greenhatch said The Curated (side) Plate was a fantastic council initiative which FAN were proud to support.

“It provides our Sunshine Coast members and the local business community the opportunity to collaborate and show locals and visitors everything we have to offer,” Ms Greenhatch said.

“The event is designed to give all local businesses and producers a chance to shine, and create further opportunities during The Curated Plate and all year round.”

The Curated Plate made its debut in 2019, showcasing local produce as curated by international, national and local chefs to foodie audiences from the coast to the hinterland.

The event drew participation from businesses and producers across all areas of the Sunshine Coast local government area.
