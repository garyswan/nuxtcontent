Project 24 is an artist in residence program that provides space for artists to develop, collaborate, experiment and showcase their work at 2ND Space, Nambour. 

This year we will host 24 x residencies engaging hundreds of artists from across the region and beyond.

Each month [Project 24](https://events.humanitix.com/project-24-sept-artist-residency-showing)
&#x20;invite you to come and meet the artist, see what they have created and connect with other creatives on the coast. 

Our [September 28](https://events.humanitix.com/project-24-sept-artist-residency-showing)
&#x20;artist showing is Orlando Mee and Libby Derham. 

**Orlando Mee**

Orlando Mee is a multimedia artist working on Narungga land in Wallaroo, South Australia.

Orlando makes video art, projection art, web-based works, VR and interactive experiences.

A key theme of his practice is nonduality or the idea that everything in the universe is deeply interconnected.

With roots in Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta, this concept is comparable to formative ideas in hypertext, as well as the network structures of modern media and computer systems.

**Libby Derham**

Watercolour runs in Libby’s veins, going back four generations in her family.

An appreciation and passion for the natural world informs her practice and the sensory experience within it.

Drawn to the avian world from a young age, Libby now seeks to explore a relatively new, deeper relationship and understanding of Australian birds and their connection within the landscape.

Currently working in Cymatics with Joseph Burgess.

Libby is exploring the relationship between watercolour and the visualisation of birdsong through liquid.
