One of comedies best, Ross Noble, celebrates his 21st solo stand-up tour with Jibber Jabber Jamboree performing at The Events Centre, Caloundra on Saturday 12 August.

To celebrate this milestone, he invites you to join him for an evening of the sort of inspired nonsense that has cemented his place as the supreme master of stream of conscious freewheeling stand up.

This is a chance to see Noble live on stage in his natural habitat.

What’s it about? What will we learn? How will it change the world? Are all pointless questions to ask when Noble is off on one of his tangents.

Grab a ticket and come and enjoy the ride.
