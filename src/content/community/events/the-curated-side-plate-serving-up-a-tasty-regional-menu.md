Calling all foodies and culinary enthusiasts! Local restaurants, farms, tourism and event operators are ready to throw open their doors as part of [The Curated (side) Plate](https://thecuratedplate.com.au/)
&#x20;culinary festival from July 29 to August 7, 2022.

Sunshine Coast Council has released the full schedule of events for this year‘s The Curated (side) Plate to be held within the Sunshine Coast region.

There has been a huge local response to the expressions of interest process resulting in 85 events managed by 37 different organisers, with more businesses expected to join the broad menu of events and culinary experiences over the coming weeks.

The 85 participating events will utilise an array of produce and event services of more than 170 Sunshine Coast businesses – all set to be on show to locals, intrastate, interstate and international visitors with more than 5000 tickets available to the various schedule of events across the 10-day period.

From regional favourites such as Harry’s on Buderim and Spicer’s Tamarind, to great local producers including Montville Coffee and Sunshine Coast Cider – The Curated (side) Plate program has it all!

Sunshine Coast Council Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said the strong range of festival events would be a fantastic showcase of the region’s fabulous food, alluring lifestyle and would offer plenty of eventful experiences.

“With 400 food tourism operators and a food agribusiness industry currently valued at more than $700 million, the Sunshine Coast is taking the opportunity to capitalise on the fast growing ‘Food Tourism’ sector,” Cr O’Pray said.

“There are plenty of locations, activities, menus and price points to suit everyone, and many hidden gems to surprise visitors and locals.

“I want everyone to taste a bit of the Sunshine Coast and support our local businesses and producers.”

Visit Sunshine Coast CEO Matt Stoeckel said good food and drink was a strong motivator for travel, and The Curated (side) Plate was the perfect opportunity to invite visitors to explore our region – plate in hand.

“From our famed Mooloolaba prawns to award-winning craft beers, incredible restaurants and agri-tourism products the Sunshine Coast has incredible culinary experiences,” Mr Stoeckel said.

“Events like this provide a platform to showcase all that is new in our food and drink experiences and build our profile as a must-visit food destination in Australia.”

Harry’s on Buderim owner and head chef Stuart Bell said he couldn’t wait to welcome the event back to the region.

“The concept is a really important step in establishing our region for its amazing produce and culinary experiences,” Mr Bell said.

“Having worked in the industry for 30 years, I understand the importance of supporting local business and I am a big advocate of sourcing local produce to create our delicious seasonal menus and monthly degustation events.”

Phillip Hart, owner of Mooloolaba’s The Dock and Sunreef, Whale One, said The Curated (side) Plate brought a phenomenal opportunity to the Sunshine Coast.

“It will allow the region to showcase what it has to offer to a national and international consumer base which will assist in economic recovery from flood and covid affected areas,” Mr Hart said.

And it’s not too late for other Sunshine Coast businesses to get involved. Businesses can still put forward events or ideas to go on the wait list to be included in the coming weeks.
