Giant columns of elephant toothpaste, high-flying toilet paper and zooming smoke rings… get ready for science as you’ve never seen it before.

These weird and wonderful effects will be part of *The Magical World of Crazy Science* show, which is returning to Venue 114 at Bokarina

The show, aimed at young people aged from four to 12 years of age, will be presented by a world-recognised, multi award-winning entertainer, magician, and visual artist, who is also a scientist and teacher.

Richard Scholes fuses magic, comedy, mime and music to teach children about science in a fun way.
