Sunshine Coast Council is pleased to partner with Disability Sports Australia in collaboration to host the first Disability Sports Australia National Conference on Thursday, June 16th at USC Stadium.

The program will feature keynote speakers who influence disability and mainstream sport and breakout stream sessions that focus on bringing the sport, government, health, education and community sectors together through the newly launched NDSP National Referral Hub.

The National Referral Hub recently received crucial funding from Federal Minister, The Hon Richard Colbeck and Sport Australia. The Hub will enable 600,000 Australians living with a disability to access adaption and inclusion activities in their community to be more active, more often after much COVID driven social isolation.

Murray Elbourn, CEO of Disability Sports Australia said, “This partnership with Sunshine Coast Council, will pave the way for a greater collaboration on the Runway to Brisbane 2032”.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Sunshine Coast was one of Australia’s premier sporting destinations offering great natural and purpose-built facilities, world class events and an ideal climate.

“And our council continues to demonstrate commitment to accessibility through improvements to public spaces and places and providing accessible amenities, beach-accessible equipment and matting.

“Our Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041 provides a long-term framework, guiding how council and our community will work together to roll out our action plan for accessible community health and wellbeing programs and sporting activities.

“Hosting the DSA National Conference will be a real opportunity to connect and create conversations to influence all levels of government and enhance our council’s ongoing plans to enable more people with a disability to be more active, more often, across our beautiful region,” Cr Law said.

USC’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Professor Tim Wess said the university was looking forward to hosting the conference and contributing to its success.

“Many of our academics and students are keen to be involved.

“We have a very strong focus on para sports in our research and we have specialised sporting facilities on campus that enable para athletes to pursue their goals,” Mr Wess said.

More information on keynote speakers and breakout session topics, will follow in the coming weeks as tickets to this unique National Conference will go on sale in late February. Tickets will be for both in person and online attendance.
