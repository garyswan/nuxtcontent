One of Australia’s largest wearable art shows is back on the Sunshine Coast in 2022. 

With more than 50 national and international entries set to take to the catwalk in a spectacular night of entertainment at Venue 114, this is a must-see show for the region.

In a unique intersection of art colliding with fashion and costumery, Australian Wearable Art provides a platform for artists and designers to embrace their creative exploration into form, structure, texture and colour using an eclectic mix of often unusual materials.

This exciting journey merges materials in weird and wonderful collaborations with art, science, fashion and technology, resulting in wearable pieces of art proudly presented on the runway.

With four main categories, artworks might be made from beautiful fresh flowers, repurposed bicycle tyres, teabags or police tape. The visual feast is hard to describe but it has the same energy as the Mardi Gras and the Met Gala combined.

The audience will enjoy the chance to meet the artists and see the works up close and personal.

Event curator Wendy Roe said the high calibre of the artists, the style of artwork as well as the intimate connection with the audience had been an important part of what made the festival so intriguing.

“We want the audience to really immerse themselves in the art and see the level of devotion that goes into making the one-of-a-kind pieces – they might even be inspired to create a piece themselves,” Ms Roe said.

“The festival is a fusion of high-end fashion with the sculptural world of art where Gaultier meets Picasso.

“We are excited to be growing the event into the larger space of Venue 114 and to offer more options for people to attend, hosting an afternoon runway show as well as a gala evening event which will include a night of food, drinks and exceptional artwork.”

The 2019 supreme winner, Jodie Whittaker, said it was the first time she had been a part of the Australian Wearable Art Festival and, while she had a love for creativity and fashion, she specialised in macramé.

“I was actually meant to be a spectator but was convinced by my mother to give it a go,” Ms Whittaker said.

“It was an amazing experience that I wasn’t expecting; you get to push the boundaries of your talent and really explore your creative side.

“The winning piece was named *Amaterasu – Goddess of the Sun* – and its inspiration came from some gold material I had for a macramé wall hanging, culminating with a trip to Japan.

“The Australian Wearable Art Festival has opened so many doors that I never dreamed of – I have since showcased pieces in the Brisbane Fashion Runway and the Emerging Designer Showcase.”

The event will have four main categories as part of both the afternoon and evening gala event: Avant-garde, Floriana, “Trashion” and Sustainable Nature.

Ms Roe said sustainability and being environmentally conscious had been a crucial part of the show which is a strong ethos of the Sunshine Coast, so it was only fitting to bring back the recycling category “Trashion” and Sustainable Nature category.

There are also additional prizes for haute couture, best headpiece, emerging artist and best tertiary and secondary student pieces. 

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said she was incredibly excited to be able to deliver the high-calibre event for the local community and visitors to the region.

 “We are certainly very proud to be able to attract events and artists who value the sustainability commitment here at Venue 114,” Ms Thompson said.

“Venue 114 has been recognised by the world’s leading scientific benchmarking certification group for travel and tourism, EarthCheck.

“Our EarthCheck Evaluate verification acknowledges our passion and drive to be at the forefront of the event industry.”
