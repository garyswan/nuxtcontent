An intimate and charming opera for families will take a magical journey to Venue 114 at Bokarina these Easter school holidays for two enchanting performances on Tuesday 13 April.

Based on Edward Lear’s beloved poem and presented by Little Match Productions, *The Owl and the Pussycat* is designed for children aged four to 10 years old and explores themes of love, adventure, harmony and acceptance.

Created by a national team of award-winning artists, be swept away in this all-new opera, featuring stunning vocals, interactive theatre, puppetry and a troupe of musical puffins.

In a pea green boat, an owl and a pussycat sail across the sea for a year and a day to fair Bong-tree Bay.

Adventure calls, new encounters await and love conquers all in a nostalgic musical journey and irresistible blend of romance and nonsense.

This interactive performance inspires, educates and enthrals by inviting children, alongside their families, carers and teachers, to participate in musical and multi-sensory ways to help our lovable couple reach their destination.

Aboard a giant magical boat moored in the sea, meet our pair’s colourful and eccentric new friends, as they are brought to life on deck.

Set sail with this charming show and you might even meet a honey-hooked Sea Bear, an itty bitty Kitty and a punky Piggy Wig.
