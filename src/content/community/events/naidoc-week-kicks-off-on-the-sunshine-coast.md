Sunshine Coast Council has started NAIDOC Week 2022 ([July 3-10](https://www.naidoc.org.au/)
).celebrations with an annual flag raising ceremony.

More than 300 people attended the ceremony at council’s Nambour administration building.

This year’s NAIDOC Week theme is *Get Up! Stand Up! Show Up!* which calls on our community to rally for systemic change and continue to support and secure institutional, structural, collaborative, and cooperative reforms.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the annual flag raising ceremony was always a special and thought-provoking way to start NAIDOC Week events held across the region.

“Throughout NAIDOC Week, there will be a diverse range of exciting and educational events held,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Council is committed to continuing to develop and strengthen relationships with First Nations people through engaging staff and stakeholders in reconciliation and piloting innovative strategies to empower First Nations people.

“This includes mandating cultural awareness training for council staff, improving employment outcomes by increasing First Nations recruitment, retention and professional development and increasing First Nations supplier diversity to support improved economic and social outcomes.

“Together we can continue to nurture a shared future that embraces culture, heritage and diversity.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Flag Raising Ceremony was the first of many events happening this week to celebrate NAIDOC Week.

“Be sure to check out the events happening as part of NAIDOC Week as an opportunity to learn about First Nations culture and histories,” Cr Law said.
