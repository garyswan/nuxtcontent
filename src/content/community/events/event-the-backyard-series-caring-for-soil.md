This is the first event as part of [Maroochy Regional Bushland Botanic Garden's The Backyard Series](https://oursc.com.au/community/events/learn-how-to-create-a-beautiful-native-garden)
.

Soil is the living ecosystem that grows and nurtures all plant life.

Learn how to care for this precious resource by encouraging the biodiversity of microbial life in your garden.

Dr. Sandra Tuszynska, a soil microbiologist and mycologist (a lover of fungi) will present the essentials in soil cultivation and demonstrate how to set up the Worm Flow bin, a unique vermicompost method to get fungi back into our soils.

She will also show you how to create a microbial liquid extract from worm castings to get more nutrition out of your plants.

Sandra is a passionate science communicator and educator. During her PhD research, she studied the cellular mechanisms of root symbiotic fungi and their ability to detoxify heavy metals to protect trees. This allowed her to understand the superpowers of fungi as natureâ€™s nurturers, regenerators, protectors and innovators.
