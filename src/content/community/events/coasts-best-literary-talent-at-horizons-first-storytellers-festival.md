Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Storytellers’ Festivalwould showcase the region’s wealth of exceptional literary talent.

“This is an event for lovers of the written and spoken word,” Cr Law said.

“There are a range of workshops for those interested in publishing their work, learning how to maximise your book’s potential, crime writing essentials, illustration masterclass, writing children’s books and so much more.

“If you have ever thought about writing your first book, don’t know how to get it out there, are experiencing writer’s block and seeking inspiration, or just appreciate a good read, now is the time to connect and immerse yourself in our passionate writing community.”
