One of Australia’s hottest indie bands of the moment, Spacey Jane, have played to a sold-out crowd on the Sunshine Coast.

Fans packed out [Venue 114](https://venue114.com.au/)
&#x20;to see the indie music darlings take their ARIA number one album *Here comes everybody* to the stage.

They played their hit singles such as *Hardlight*, *It’s been a long day* and *Sitting up* as well as the bonus track *Sorry instead*.
