The Melbourne Storm will relocate its June 5 NRL clash with the Gold Coast Titans to Sunshine Coast Stadium due to the growing COVID-19 outbreak in Melbourne.

Tickets for the Round 13 match are on sale now through [ticketek.com.au](https://premier.ticketek.com.au/shows/show.aspx?sh=STORMTTN21)
. Ticket prices range from $20 to $85 and family packages are available.

The seating configuration will be designated seating in the Grandstand and Try Zones and picnic style seating on the grass mounds (picnic rugs or cushions, no chairs).

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said council was delighted to be able to provide our Sunshine Coast Stadium to the Melbourne Storm again at such short notice.

“We certainly feel for the people of Victoria and hope the Storm can soon return to their family and friends,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“In the meantime, we will take good care of them, as we did last year, and I encourage everyone to get their tickets and see the reigning premiers in action next Saturday.

“It will be a big day of rugby league action on the Sunshine Coast with the Sunshine Coast Falcons and Redcliffe Dolphins competing for the James Ackerman Cup, the curtain raiser to this Melbourne Storm v Gold Coast Titans game.

“I’d like to thank all the staff at council and Melbourne Storm who have been working very hard in the past 24 hours to make this game possible.”

The Storm has been based on the Sunshine Coast since May 14 for a mid-season camp and was due to return to Melbourne following last night’s (27/5/21) round 12 NRL clash with the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium. 

The Sunshine Coast became a home away from home for the Storm in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the club playing (and winning) six of its regular season matches at Sunshine Coast Stadium en route to winning last year’s NRL premiership.
