Sunshine Coast Council Libraries invite you to enjoy an evening with award-winning young adult author Rhiannon Wilde at the Little Book Nook, Palmwoods, from 5.30pm Wednesday 1 September.

This special literary event is part of a Sunshine Coast Libraries author events series hosted at locations across the region.

Rhiannon will talk about her debut fiction release *Henry Hamlet’s Heart,* a sparkling LGBTQI romance set in Brisbane with characters impossible to forget.

The story revolves around Henry in his last semester of high school and his sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking journey to love.

Rhiannon has been a journalist and English high school teacher, before devoting herself to writing full time.

Her short story *You Deserve Nothing* was longlisted for the Queensland Young Writer’s Award and in 2019, *Henry Hamlet’s Heart,* won the Queensland Literary Awards Glendower Award for emerging Queensland Writer.

Rhiannon’s book will be available to purchase at the venue and there will be a book signing session.

Tickets are $10 per person and includes soup, focaccia and one drink.

Bookings are essential via council’s library website: [library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Rhiannon-Wilde)


The community is reminded to stay COVID alert and stay at home if unwell.

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in using the Queensland Government QR code and follow Queensland Health directions including mandatory mask wearing, unless under 12 years or for health reasons.

Event opens at 5.30pm for 6pm start.

Rhiannon will be joined by special guest journalist and writer, Roxanne McCarty-O’Kane. The Little Book Nook is located at Shop 5/4-6 Little Main Street, Palmwoods.
