Council is holding a Caring for our Backyard Information Day to educate residents about what is going on in their area and learn how to care for their properties.

Come along and learn about ways you can care for your backyard.

The event will be held from 9am-3pm, Saturday 5 February 2022 at Peachester Hall, 960 Peachester Rd, Peachester.

Turn up on the day or register to receive a free native plant.

Entry is free including morning tea, and lunch will be available locally for purchase.

Feel free to pop in throughout the day and visit our community stalls set up outside the hall.

Bring along a weed to the Invasive plants and animals stall and get it identified.

Sunshine Coast Council will also be running a Responsible Pet Ownership stall where you can get answers to any questions regarding domestic pets.

Council’s Coastal Discovery Van, Worm Farming and Regenerative Agriculture by Polyculture, and Sunshine Coast Environmental Council will also have stalls and have a wealth of knowledge to share, so bring your questions along and enjoy a great day out.

Bookings are required to attend the talks in the hall and numbers are strictly limited, so be sure to register.

There will be talks on a variety of topics including birdlife, worm farming, regenerative agriculture, shorebirds, biochar to improve soils and invasive animal management.
