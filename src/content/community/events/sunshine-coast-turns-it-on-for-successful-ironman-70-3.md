Triathletes, their family, and friends have enjoyed a weekend to remember at IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast.

More than 1,500 athletes took part in Sunday’s event, completing a 1.9km swim, 90km ride and 21.1km run in stunning conditions on the Sunshine Coast.

Brisbane’s Nicholas Free won the men’s race, with Lotte Wilms from the Netherlands standing on the top step of the podium in the women’s race.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said IRONMAN continues to be a great opportunity to showcase the Sunshine Coast.

“Our region offers so much for event participants and visitors and we are pleased that it was possible for them to come to our Sunshine Coast during the pandemic,” said Mr Jamieson.

“Aside from the global exposure from being part of IRONMAN 70.3 series, this event provided an invaluable contribution to many of our local businesses at a time when it is needed most.”

Rob Stalling, Regional Director for The IRONMAN Group Oceania, thanked those who were a part of the event, with all involved making for a successful IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast.

“Congratulation to all who made it to the start line on Sunday, including the more than 200 athletes from the Sunshine Coast,” said Mr Stalling.

“Almost a third of competitors were taking part in IRONMAN 70.3 Sunshine Coast for the first time and we look forward to seeing them at an event again in the future.

“The feedback that we’ve had post event has been overwhelmingly positive and it puts us in a real positive position for the years to come,” he said.

“I’d also like to thank our more than 400 volunteers, events like this would not be possible without your support, your smiling faces and encouraging words were a great boost to athletes throughout the day.”

Tourism and Sport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe commended the IRONMAN 70.3 competitors on their commitment.

“To swim, ride and run 113 kilometres requires extraordinary determination but athletes weren’t Sunday’s only winners,” Mr Hinchliffe said. “The IRONMAN 70.3 event was also a victory for tourism and accommodation operators on the Sunshine Coast.

“Events like IRONMAN 70.3 are big contributors to the Sunshine Coast’s visitor economy with an estimated $1.85 million moving through the region’s cash registers to support local jobs and our pandemic recovery plan.”
