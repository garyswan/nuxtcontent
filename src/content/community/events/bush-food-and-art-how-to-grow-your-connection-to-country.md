Residents have the chance to learn and celebrate nature’s wonders through food, art and connection in a unique, one-off workshop event.

As part of the Living Lab @ The MET series of workshops, Witjuti Grub Bushfood Nursery’s Veronica Cougan and First Nations artist Jandamarra Cadd will share their knowledge and passion on May 13 in Maroochydore.

### **Save the date:** Saturday, May 13, 9am to 12:30pm

#### During this 3.5 hour workshop participants will:

*   Learn how to create a bushfood garden in your own backyard
*   Enjoy a wide range of tastings of fresh seasonal bushfood produce and a bushfood-inspired morning tea
*   Undertake a Gulpa Ngawal (Deep Listening) art workshop in the green spaces of the MET site

Veronica will first teach participants how to grow their own bushfood garden in a backyard setting, drawing on 25 years’ experience with bushfood plants, before offering a delicious bushfood morning tea.

Jandamarra, a Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Warung descendent living on Gubbi Gubbi country, will then lead an outdoor Gulpa Ngawal (Deep Listening) art workshop.

This involves leading participants through artistic and personal practices, using both conventional art materials and natural elements, to creatively express a deeper understanding of identity in relation to one’s connection to Country.

Keen to get involved? Wear a hat, sunscreen and comfortable clothes for outdoors, and bring a small, natural, special item from home to use in the artwork activity.

While on site, remember to take a moment to see Jandamarra’s United Journey artwork, which is on display at the MET.

#### Workshop tickets are $30.28, including booking fee.
