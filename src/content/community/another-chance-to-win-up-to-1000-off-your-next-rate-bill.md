Sunshine Coast ratepayers once again have the chance to win up to $1000 off their next rate bill by signing up to receive future rate notices by email.

Sunshine Coast Council Outstanding Organisation Portfolio Councillor Ted Hungerford said ratepayers could put themselves in the running to win up $1000 off their rates bill by switching their rates notice delivery method from traditional post to email, before Wednesday August 17.

“Simply register for a [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account or login to an existing account, change your rate notice delivery method to email before Wednesday, August 17 and you’ll be in the running. If you already receive your rates notices by email, you’re already in the draw,” Cr Hungerford said.

“You can create your own [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on council’s website and once you’ve done that or logged into your existing account, all you need to do is click on ‘Update your rate notice delivery’ under the Property and Rates section on your MyCouncil dashboard, and change to email.

“Receiving rates notices by email rather than traditional post is more environmentally friendly and registering for a MyCouncil account enables residents to access a wide range of convenient and secure online options.

“MyCouncil enables you to request services, register pets and business owners can also register to access a range of business services. Your information is only viewable by you.”

You’ll find a step-by-step guide to setting up your [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;account on [council’s website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Site-Help/MyCouncil-FAQs/Registering)
. There is also a [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?edufilter=NULL&v=s2wzyuO43Y8)
&#x20;to show you how to change your rates delivery method from traditional post to email.

There is a range of convenient online payment options available, including BPAY and by phone on 131 816. Check your rates notice to see all the ways you can pay.

Council also has a direct debit option, which can be set up to pay rates in full by the due date, to make life easier for busy ratepayers.

To assist with online or over-the-phone payments, property owners will need their payment reference number, found on their rates notice.

Ratepayers who cannot make payment by the due date (August 19) are encouraged to enter into a payment arrangement by logging into [MyCouncil](https://mycouncil.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
&#x20;or by contacting council before August 19.

You can also [set up a payment arrangement on line, via councils website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Pay-and-Apply/Rates/Pay-by-instalments?utm_source=corporate&utm_medium=spotlights&utm_campaign=Rates)
.

For rates enquiries, email council at rates\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au or contact council <https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council>
&#x20;between 8.15am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.

Council is warning residents to be aware of bogus emails requesting payment of rates.

Council has become aware of a small number of incidents where a scammer has emailed residents asking for payment of rates using a BSB and bank account number.

Please note that council never asks for rates to be paid to a BSB and account number.

Please pay your rates using the methods printed on your rate notice. Please contact council directly if you have any questions.

If anyone receives an email of this nature and recognises it as a scam, the matter can be reported online to [www.scamwatch.gov.au](http://www.scamwatch.gov.au)


Anyone who has received an email of this nature and paid money to the emailer is encouraged to contact Policelink on 131 444 so that the matter can be investigated.
