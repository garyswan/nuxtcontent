Nine Sunshine Coast residents have been recognised in the Australia Day 2022 Honours list for their contributions to education, medicine, sport, media, community and international criminal investigations.

“Each of these Australia Day Award recipients has worked extremely hard in their respective professions to make a positive impact on our community and our Nation,” Mayor Jamieson said.  

“The wide array of fields in which our Sunshine Coast award recipients have been recognised also highlights the diversity of excellence that exists within our region, from education and performing arts, to forensic pathology, international criminal investigations with the United Nations, to winning gold at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and broadcast media and charity work.”
