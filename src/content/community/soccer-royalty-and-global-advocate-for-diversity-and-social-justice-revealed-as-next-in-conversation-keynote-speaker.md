Renowned for tackling big issues, Venue 114’s next signature *In Conversation* event is set to spark powerful dialogue.

*In Conversation – Becoming Anti-Racist* will feature former Socceroo’s captain, award-winning broadcaster, Member of Australian Multicultural Council and Human Rights activist Craig Foster AM as special guest.

Thepowerfulevent invites attendees to join Mr Foster and panellists to openly discuss the impact racism can have on the Sunshine Coast community.

Scheduled for Friday July 22 at Venue 114, Bokarina, this unique breakfast warmly welcomes everyone to attend.

Well-known for representing Australia on the international soccer stage, followed by a career in sports broadcasting, Craig was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2021 for his significant services to multiculturalism, human rights and refugee support organisations, and to football.

Mr Foster is a humanitarian recognised for his advocacy for sport and human rights.

“We all have a responsibility to break down barriers to equal social participation of our fellow Australians and this means acknowledging and understanding racism, being willing to hear about the experiences of those around us and being mindful and sensitive to their well-being in our daily lives,” Mr Foster said.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the community was proud to welcome leaders in the field of positive action and social harmony.

“Venue 114’s *In Conversation* event provides the ideal stage to facilitate a conversation about what it means to be anti-racist as an individual and as a society,” Cr Law said.

“As a part of council’s [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
, we are committed to creating a strong community that is connected, inclusive and cohesive.

“The *In Conversation* events were founded on a passion to educate, engage and empower our community; to sow seeds of thought and invite growth.

“The *Becoming Anti-Racist* theme will invite robust, uncomfortable yet important discussions on how we all have a responsibility to be anti-racist.”

Joining Mr Foster in a powerful and thought-provoking discussion is MC Mackayla Jefferies and panellists:

*   David Hollinsworth, Adjunct Professor at the University of the Sunshine Coast
*   Peppi Bueti, Director of Sunny Comms
*   Christine Thomas of Cygnet Centre Peacebuilding and Transformation
*   Walters Nkemfack, Founder and Coordinator of Sunshine Coast African Diaspora Community.

Along with this impactful conversation, guests will enjoy the exquisite flavours of a menu curated by much-loved local caterers, Penfolds Catering and a performance by Australian/Fijian singer-songwriter Andrea Kirwin.
