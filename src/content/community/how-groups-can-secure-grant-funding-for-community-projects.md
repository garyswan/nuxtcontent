Community groups wanting to undertake projects and programs or needing upgrades to their facilities are invited to apply for a Major Grant.

The Sunshine Coast Council program, which offers grants of up to $30,000, supports community organisations to deliver one-off projects, events and activities that demonstrate a community purpose and align with strategic priorities.

### Major Grant applications can be submitted in one of six categories: 

*   community development
*   community facilities
*   creative development
*   cultural heritage
*   economic development
*   sports and recreation.

More than $500,000 in funding is available in the now open Major Grants round, which closes on March 13.

Council invites local volunteers and community committee members seeking funding to register for a free 90-minute grant writing workshop being held during February.

These in-person workshops and online webinars provide the opportunity for participants to meet council’s grants team and learn what makes a grant winning application.

Book a free grant writing workshop or webinar on council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Help-and-Resources/Grant-Workshops)
.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the program recognised the contribution community groups made to the Sunshine Coast.

“The program’s focus is on supporting projects that respond to community need and activate the community in a resilient and vibrant way,” Cr Law said.

“Groups are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the program and to help achieve council’s vision of being Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative.

“Be sure to come along and learn council’s top 10 tips for grant writing success and get to know council’s Grants Team by attending a free Grant Writing Workshop or Webinar in February.”

Topics include Major and Minor grant eligibility, co-funding requirements, project planning and grant writing tips.

Each workshop will explore how to plan and communicate projects, what supporting documentation to include, and how to complete project budgets.

Blackall Range Woodcrafters Guild past president Max Barrenger said the group was fortunate to receive a Major Grant of $7500 last year to replace machinery.

“We applied for a Major Grant after attending the free grant writing workshop last year,” Mr Barrenger said.

“The session was extremely helpful to understand how to fill in the grant application and know what supporting documents we needed for our submission.

“I would recommend the free grant writing workshops for any groups looking to apply for a grant.

“The workshop gave an insight into what the committee looks for in grant applications and was invaluable to our group.”

Eligible not-for-profit organisations can apply now for up to $15,000 towards one-off projects, events and activities that meet community need and provide community benefit.

Grants of up to $30,000 are also available towards infrastructure projects that involve developing, maintaining or improving buildings or land that contribute to providing a safe, accessible and inclusive community facility.  

Environment Levy Grants of up to $5000 are available to not-for-profit community organisations for projects that make a positive and ongoing contribution to the region's biodiversity and waterways.

### **Key dates:**

*   Round opens: February 1, 2023

*   Round closes: March 13, 2023
