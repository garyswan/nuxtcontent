In a major boost for local not-for-profit community groups, Sunshine Coast Council has announced more than $550,000 will support 95 local projects in its latest Major Grants round.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was proud to see council continue to support a variety of projects which would provide community benefit well into the future.

“It’s great to see so many Sunshine Coast community groups receive funding to deliver one-off projects, events and activities which benefit the entire region,” Cr Law said.

“The successful funding recipients are certainly making a difference and contributing to our thriving community.”

One community group set to benefit is the Maleny and District Men’s Shed Incorporation, having been awarded $6394 in the Community Facilities category towards erecting a new shed.

Men’s Sheds play an import role in improving men’s health and wellbeing by offering an inclusive and safe place for all men from a local community to come together, and by providing important health information.

Maleny and District Men’s Shed Incorporation Secretary Lindsay Hay said he was thrilled the group had received a Major Grant with membership increasing recently.

“Our Men’s Shed now has more than 50 members and the funding will go towards erecting a shed recently donated by the Australian Defence Force and allow expansion of the Men’s Shed’s activities,” Mr Hay said.

“Our members are excited to get into alternative activities such as leatherwork, lead lighting, cards and computers, as well as having a breakout space for meals and information sessions.”

Cr Law said in this round of funding, there were a lot of important community projects, including youth programs, creative and cultural events, and facility upgrades.

“Council’s Community Grants Program acknowledges and strengthens the valuable contribution community groups and their volunteers make towards achieving our shared vision and goal of being Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart, creative, while also fostering a strong community,” he said

Other successful grant applicants include Save Our Streets Ltd., receiving $7500 for their 2022 National Reconciliation Week Cultural Awareness Project, Wan'diny NAIDOC Committee, which received $10,000 towards their NAIDOC 2022 Wan'diny Family Fun Day, and Sunshine Coast Film Festivals, which received $15,000 towards the 2022 Sunshine Coast Film Festival.
