There’s no doubt about it, we’re in for a wet spring and summer with the Sunshine Coast region predicted to see a 60% increase in rainfall just for the month of October. \*

Right now, our teams are out and about caring for our 1183 hectares of parklands and reserves across the Sunshine Coast region…that’s equivalent to 1690 football fields!

Parks and Gardens manager Nicholas Coluccio said council’s team had spent months preparing for the impending wet conditions by focusing on maintaining garden beds, turfing and ensuring our region’s open spaces were looking tip top.

“We know increased rainfall and warmer soil conditions make for favourable grass growing conditions,” Mr Coluccio said.

“While this keeps the kangaroos and grasshoppers happy, it can make for overgrown and difficult mowing conditions.

“Our Parks and Gardens team has started an increased spring and summer mowing roster as they aim to and stay ahead of the grass growth. However, the predicted increase in consistent rainfall means many sites might become too wet for our heavy mowers to access without causing considerable damage.

“Our team takes pride in caring for our open spaces and is actively working to keep our region looking top notch.”

If you see something that needs attention, you can log requests via council’s website, phone 5475 7272, or email us at customerservice\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.
