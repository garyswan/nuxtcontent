We already know how beautiful Sunshine Coast beaches are, but do you know just how accessible they are?

Channel Seven's WEEKENDER program with Paralympian Susan Seipel shined the spotlight on accessible tourism on the Sunshine Coast.

Equity and inclusion are key principles Council values and in our community, which is why it's essential to identify accessible routes suitable for everyone.

The program takes the viewer on a journey to the new [Mooloolaba Foreshore boardwalk](https://oursc.com.au/community/lets-stroll-down-the-boardwalk-in-mooloolaba)
, coastal pathways, beach accessibility equipment and how inclusive each destinations is for prams, walkers, scooters or people with limited mobility whether permanent or temporary.

Council is also working on a revolutionary pilot project focusing on inclusivity and mobility which aims to change the way our community travels across some popular areas of the Sunshine Coast.  

Modern mapping-technology and specially trained wheelchair pilots tracked routes from Maroochydore to Mooloolaba.

The innovative technology collects information about our footpath conditions, access to public transport and parking, amenities, boardwalks, beach accesses and more.

The program was undertaken in partnership with Briometrix and Spinal Life Australia – both leading providers of technology solutions for people with disabilities.

The data is being collated to create the mobility maps which are expected to go live late April 2022.

The data is being collated to create the mobility maps which are expected to go live on council's website by April 2022.
