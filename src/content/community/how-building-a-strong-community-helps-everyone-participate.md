Sunshine Coast Council and the region’s community have joined forces to deliver important initiatives in the past year.

This includes more than $4 million invested in 875 community grants for projects, events and partnerships providing direct community benefits that align with [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019 - 2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said council had worked with the local community to achieve “incredible results”.

“We are proud to present the Sunshine Coast [Community Strategy Annual Report for 2021/22](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;which summarises the key achievements during the latest financial year,” Cr Law said.

“It exemplifies the practical work being undertaken to achieve our collective long-term goals of achieving a strong community with opportunities for everyone to participate and contribute to community life.

“A great example includes the work undertaken with Briometrix where a pilot project was undertaken to create an [online mobility map](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Community-Support/Access-inclusion-and-disability/Mobility-mapping)
&#x20;tracking the accessibility of routes from Maroochydore to Mooloolaba.

“The team was able to work in collaboration with local people with disability to co-design the map and is now a useful resource enabling people to plan their trips and get around more easily.  

“The mobility map identifies footpaths, shared pathways and trails accessible for people of all abilities, from mums and dads with toddlers, to elderly with walkers, people using mobility aides and anyone with wheels on pathways.”

Council continues to progress implementation of the third innovate [Reconciliation Action Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Sunshine-Coast-Reconciliation-Action-Plan)
&#x20;to further embed reconciliation commitments, foster meaningful partnerships and support social and economic opportunities for the First Nations community.

“A number of successful initiatives have been delivered with our community partners, including the Candlelight Vigil at Cotton Tree Park to raise awareness and prevent domestic and family violence and initiatives to support people experiencing homelessness,” Cr Law said.

“We have co-designed the powerful Shine a Light on Racism campaign, the Migrant Work Ready Program to help new migrants prepare for work and build connections, and an All Access Day at the Beach, partnering with Mooloolaba Surf Club to celebrate International Day of People with Disability.

“Council launched the new ‘Have Your Say’ online engagement platform to enhance community engagement projects and provide creative ways to engage with the community.  

“Our Youth Council helped us engage with more than 600 young people aged 12-24 to gain an understanding of what this age group loves about the Sunshine Coast, what is important to them, and areas of concern.

“We successfully delivered a range of programs and events to support healthy and active lifestyles, including active transport programs with schools, volunteer beach clean ups and programs, activities and events within our community and sporting venues, libraries, galleries and heritage museums.

“Great new infrastructure such as the Mooloolaba Northern Parkland and Adventure Playground, Nambour Aquatic Splash Park, Dicky Beach Skate Park and Beerwah Community Meeting Place provide opportunities for active recreation and places for the community to come together.”

The [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019 - 2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;was adopted in November 2019. It provides long-term direction on how council and our community will work together to advance our shared goal of achieving a strong community through to 2041.

Cr Law said the 20-year strategy helped us to build on our values and shape a community which is, healthy and active, vibrant, inclusive, connected and resilient, and creative and innovative.

“The Community Strategy is delivering a pathway to create a strong Sunshine Coast community and Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative,” he said.
