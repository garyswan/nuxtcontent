A tree-top tower that will help children’s confidence soar, combined with cool, shaded areas where students, parents and grandparents can relax in comfort are key elements of the Sunshine Coast’s newest park.

Situated in Sippy Downs, the park will service a growing urban community, creating a place that provides green relief with mature trees and social opportunities.

Make your own nature connections by discovering this urban park with sight, sound and smell.

A feature of the new Sippy Downs Forest Park is a three-level tower, elevated in the tree canopy surrounded by lofty trees and creeping vines sure to unleash young wildlings.

The west and east sections of the park have sprung from the ground-up and are spurring adventure in time for the Easter school holidays.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the first stage of construction of the new green space provided shaded meadows, nature-inspired play and social spaces for all to enjoy.

“This new green heart services the needs of the evolving community and education precinct between the Sunshine Motorway and Sippy Downs Drive,” Mayor Jamieson said.  

“The District Level Park encourages the Sippy Down’s community, as well as surrounding suburbs, to enjoy our thriving outdoors and importantly provides visual respite from the urban environment.

“It’s a Council priority through the Recreation Parks Plan that our outdoor areas create gathering spaces which link people and place, foster community cohesiveness and improve mental health.”

A forest experience can be enjoyed by all ages and abilities. It supports active and passive recreation opportunities and is an inviting place for students to take a break.

The park features contemporary shelters and public amenities designed to complement the natural surrounds, as well as a mixture of established trees and open spaces, social spaces for barbecues and a variety of natural seating options.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said creating a place that appreciated nature was an important part of developing our region as Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart and creative.

“I’m pleased to have Sippy Down’s latest and greatest park open in time for the Easter school holidays,” Cr Dickson said.

“This is a place we can all gather and connect as a community and with nature in cooler, vegetated spaces.

“There are so many elements of this park I’m proud to see come to fruition, including the tree top tower.

“The tower gives kids a bird-like feeling of being high among the trees, gazing over the forest park from their perch.”

Construction started on the west and east park areas in June 2022 and was completed by March 2023. The middle section of parkland will be completed at a future stage and is subject to funding.

Connecting pathways, intimate forest experiences, an outdoor classroom and discovery trails will also be interconnected throughout the forest park once the future stages of works are completed, providing for great bird watching and learning experiences.

The new park can be accessed from Botanica Drive, Central Drive and High Street at Sippy Downs.
