Works on the first stage of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation project continue with the highly anticipated Northern Parkland set to be unveiled in July.

Sunshine Coast Council is now seeking community input on two elements of the foreshore masterplan ahead of future works including addressing the Loo with a View, its aged state and accessibility issues.

From Wednesday, March 30 to Wednesday, May 4, the community will be asked to provide feedback on:

*   **The meeting place and public amenities (Central Meeting Place):** to help determine the functions and facilities that residents and visitors value in the Central Meeting Place, which encompasses the Loo with a View, to inform design options to be prepared later in the year.
*   **Cove Kiosk (Northern Parkland):** to understand what type of food and drink outlet/s should be available in the Northern Parkland.

This community engagement will determine how these future Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation works progress.

Recent independent engineering assessments revealed the Loo with a View building is suffering the impacts of its highly corrosive beach environment – as occurs with many coastal buildings of this age.

These assessments indicated the facility will require constant maintenance to address extensive material corrosion, weathered decking and roof deterioration. While the Loo with a View is still functional and safe, the structure is ageing with several areas ‘beyond repair’.

Furthermore, the Loo with a View does not meet modern Universal Access (People with Disability Access) requirements. Its surrounding decks and pathways provide limited access for those in our community with a disability, parents, carers, and those using mobility devices or prams.

To meet modern building design standards and Universal Access Requirements, refurbishment of the existing facility will require significant redesign.

For these reasons, council is seeking community feedback and exploring options for the Loo with a View’s future.

The first step in the two-phase community engagement process will occur from March 30 to May 4, 2022.

During this time, residents and visitors will be asked about the functions and facilities they value in the Central Meeting Place, which encompasses the Loo with a View.

The feedback received through this engagement will assist council to develop informed options for the Central Meeting Place - including its viewing decks, event space and public amenities.

During the second phase of engagement later this year, these options will be presented back to the community for further feedback, assisting council to determine the final outcome for the Central Meeting Place.

This may include refurbishment, building new or some other option highlighted through the engagement process.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said he was honouring his commitment to seek further community input on the existing Loo with a View facility before going forward with the preferred option.

“With the current building now 25 years old and Stage Two set to begin, this is the perfect time to ask our community what they value about the current amenities, meeting spaces and viewing decks along the foreshore and what they would like to see in the future,” Cr Natoli said.

“I recognise this facility is much loved by our residents and visitors, so this is an opportunity to gather their opinions on what they value, to help us move forward.”
