The “power of listening and learning’’ was harnessed as hundreds gathered to support those impacted by a hidden pandemic.

The Sunshine Coast community stood together to mark Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month (May) at the *Empower Her Voice* march and candle-lighting vigil at Cotton Tree Park on May 3.

The annual event has been held by Centacare since 2000.

Sunshine Coast Councillor Maria Suarez spoke at the vigil, which was proudly supported by Council, and thanked all those who attended.

### “Your presence sends a message of support and acts a reminder that there is no place for domestic and family violence on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Suarez said.

“We had the opportunity to listen to a number of voices and stories from people in our region and I thank those people and admire their courage in sharing to make sure the voices of women are heard.

“There is so much power in listening and learning. Help us empower her voice this May.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was incredibly moved by the evening.

“The attendance showed the strength of support individuals and our community have to unite against domestic and family violence,” Cr Law said.

“I’d like to thank Centacare for partnering with Council to coordinate this very important event and for their hard work and dedication to supporting our community, including survivors of domestic and family violence.

### “This May, remember to Stop. Listen. Act. during Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month.”
