A new era of waste collection for the Sunshine Coast is here, as Queensland-based, family-owned company JJ’s Waste & Recycling takes over the region’s waste collection services from Saturday July 9, 2022.

The milestone also coincides with the start of Sunshine Coast Council’s expanded garden organics collection service, which will see an additional 45,000 households recycling their garden waste.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson today unveiled the fleet of new-look trucks.

“This new contract and expanded garden organics service will deliver on the Sunshine Coast Waste Strategy; council’s goals for a circular economy for waste; and our goal to be a zero net emissions organisation by 2041,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“In today’s dollars, this is council’s largest service-delivery contract valued at $146 million over eight years and as with every service council provides, we have sought to offer an excellent customer service that represents real value for money.

“The new contract also opens up opportunities and possibilities to further our goal to be a zero net emissions organisation.

“Garden waste from approximately 86,000 households across the region will now be diverted from landfill, to prevent more greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere.

Green trucks will empty your household garden organics bin

“And excitingly, we will partner with JJ’s Waste & Recycling to explore even more carbon-saving initiatives through emerging technologies for low emission vehicles.

“In the beginning, the new fleet will include one electric vehicle which will service public place bins in our community.

“We also plan to trial a hydrogen fuel cell waste truck later this year and, depending on the success of the trials, determine how we might transition to electric or hydrogen fuel cell trucks in future years as technology matures.

“We are continuing to achieve our vision: Australia’s most sustainable region. Healthy. Smart. Creative.”

Sunshine Coast Council Service Portfolio Councillor Christian Dickson said council had been working closely with the new service provider to mobilise the new waste collection contract.

The teal truck will be used to collect commercial waste, for public place bins and to generally help out where it's needed

“When surveyed last year, our community identified waste collection, recycling and material use as one of council’s strengths to maintain,” Cr Dickson said.

“We recognise waste management is a vital council service and remain committed to meet householders’ high expectations.

“Initially there will be no change to the household waste services collection days as we transition, however residents are reminded to please put their bins on the kerb the night before.”

General Manager for JJ’s Waste David Colvin said residents and businesses could expect a reliable service when the new contract began.

“We welcome the collection drivers currently working for Remondis who have joined our JJ’s Waste teams and will be working from Yandina and Sippy Downs,” Mr Colvin said.

“We value the knowledge and experience they bring to the new contract. This local knowledge is invaluable.

“Driver experience partnered with the new technology we are introducing to the contract will ensure a seamless transition for Sunshine Coast residents.

“In contracts recently commenced by JJ’s Waste, councils have found a dramatic reduction in missed collection services.

“Our in-vehicle system, j-Track®, provides our drivers with alerts if it recognises that a street or segment has been missed.

“Additional technology, such as our Council Portal, also allows customer service teams to monitor collection services as they happen.

“Not only is information technology improved, the 12-month preparation and lead in time has allowed us to invest in a fleet of new state-of-the-art vehicles for the region.

“The fleet of new diesel vehicles meet emissions standards known as Euro 6 applied by the European Union to minimise fuel use and harmful exhaust emissions.

“This standard is above the current requirements for Australian diesel vehicles which will ensure a cleaner, quieter service for Sunshine Coast residents.

“The vehicles have been manufactured by our own in-house engineering division, JJR Engineering, who have been responsible for the development of many of the innovations we see in the waste industry today.”

This Monday (July 11, 2022) also marks the start of council’s expanded garden organics bin collection service, which will see around an extra 50,000 households divert green waste from landfill to be mulched and re-used.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said the expanded garden organics service contributed to a cleaner, greener environment and sustainable future.

“Community feedback received in February 2021 from 7500 residents regarding the future management of Sunshine Coast waste revealed overwhelming support for expanding the garden organics service to contribute to a better and more sustainable future,” Cr Suarez said.

“We thank the Sunshine Coast community for their strong support for the expansion of this service, which is also our first step towards implementing a future Food Organics and Garden Organics bin service.”

The 240L garden organics bin service is expected to cost approximately $35 per year, subject to change.

Sunshine Coast Council awarded the new $146 million collection contract to JJ’s Waste & Recycling in August 2021, after a comprehensive market sounding and rigorous procurement process through an open tender, which was overseen by an independent probity advisor.

Mayor Jamieson thanked former contractor Remondis Pty Ltd for its service over the past eight years.
