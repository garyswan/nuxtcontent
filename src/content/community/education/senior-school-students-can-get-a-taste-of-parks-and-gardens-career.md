Sunshine Coast high school students can take advantage of a unique work experience program and get a taste of what their future may look like with a career at Sunshine Coast Council’s Parks and Gardens Branch.

A five-day work experience program is open to students in Years 10, 11 and 12 looking to obtain on-the job skills and experience in a Parks and Gardens operational environment across six fields.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said students would gain insight into the various parks and gardens-related professions while being provided with opportunities to experience first-hand basic technical skills within their chosen field.

“If you love the outdoors and take pride in your work, why not try work experience in horticulture,” Cr Suarez said.

“Have a green thumb? Or potential to grow one? Nursery operations could be the place for you.”

Students can also learn more about behind the scenes of running a branch through the field of administration.

The program allows students to gain practical experience in a parks and gardens operational environment within key career fields, including:

-horticulture

-aboriculture

-turf and irrigation

-nursery operations

-infrastructure maintenance

-administration

As well as developing transferable skills such as technical, communication, teamwork and an understanding how the Parks and Gardens Branch operates, students receive a certificate of completion at the end of the five-day program.

Arboreal Services Tree Maintenance Technician Dave Greenwood said he was proud to be part of a team that planted more than 2500 street trees last year.

“Street trees are an important part of our lifestyle here on the Sunshine Coast,” Mr Greenwood said.

“Through my role, I play an important part in keeping them healthy for generations to come.”

Council’s work experience programs help high school students make informed decisions about their future and provide an opportunity to explore potential careers.
