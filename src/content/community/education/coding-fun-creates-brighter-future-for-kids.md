Children as young as toddlers are about to be introduced to the exciting world of coding and programming thanks to Sunshine Coast Libraries.

Modern and engaging, Cool Coding Kits are free to borrow and are now available at all eight library locations.

Fostering STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) skills through exciting hands-on and creative play, these kits are suitable for children aged 18 months and up.

Community Portfolio Councillor Cr David Law said Sunshine Coast Libraries were again leading the way in offering the community a broad range of educational and fun resources.

“The Cool Coding Kits add to the outstanding collection of educational resources available to children of all ages across our eight branches,” Cr Law said.

“We know the importance of brain development in the early years, and the introduction of these coding kits will allow parents and children to engage together to build problem solving and critical thinking skills.”

The two new types of coding kits available include a bright red Play & Learn Action Racer and a musical, light-up Code and Go Bumblebee.

Through pressing directional input buttons on these toys and watching the resulting movement patterns, children will delight in their first foray into basic coding skills and learn cause and effect through play.
