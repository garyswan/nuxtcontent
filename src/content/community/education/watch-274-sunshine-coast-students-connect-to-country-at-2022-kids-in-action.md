WATCH RECAP: our hugely popular [Kids in Action program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Education-Resources-and-Events/Kids-in-Action-Program/Kids-in-Action)
&#x20;celebrates its 10th anniversary this year - with 20 local schools taking part for 2022.

Here is a RECAP of all the fun and excitement during the Environmental Projects Day held earlier this year in May when 274 students and teachers from the participating schools across the Sunshine Coast region, together to connect with and explore this year’s theme ‘Catchment Connections: Mountains to the Sea.’

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e43QcWjSGrU>


School delegates, along with 66 First Nations partners, workshop mentors, volunteers, youth leaders, and guests, began the day at the Nambour Showgrounds with a warm Welcome to Country from Kabi Kabi / Gubbi Gubbi and Jinibara Traditional Custodians.

Student representatives from each school then shared heartfelt and meaningful 'Acknowledgement of Country' words and feelings that grounded hearts, minds and hands before setting off onto country for 'Catchment Connection' Bus Tours journeying along the Noosa, Maroochy, Mooloolah and Mary River catchments.

Schools connected with and learnt from indigenous and environmental mentors as they journeyed and experienced the beauty and diversity of the Coast’s waterways and landscapes, discovering culture, Country and significant flora and fauna species.

Participating schools will now choose topics that inspired their curiosity and inquiry, and research them further to build presentations to share with each other at the Kids Teaching Kids Conference in September.

The [Kids in Action Program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Education-Resources-and-Events/Kids-in-Action-Program/Kids-in-Action)
&#x20;acknowledges the generosity of Traditional Custodians and First Nations mentors, and environmental experts, in sharing their knowledge, wisdom, practice and culture for us to listen and learn from.
