Gumboots and umbrellas in hand, the rain didn’t deter more than 300 students from sharing their knowledge with each other on Friday October 15, 2021 at Maroochy Regional Botanic Gardens as part of the 2021 Kids in Action Conference.

Kids from 21 schools within the Sunshine Coast Council regional area as well as Noosa came together for the 9th annual Kids Teaching Kids Conference to celebrate and showcase the environmental projects they’ve been working on for the past few terms.

Designed for students from Years 5-8, Sunshine Coast Council’s Kids in Action program includes the Environmental Projects Day, which occurred at Ewen Maddock Dam in Landsborough back in May, and last week’s Conference.

The program aims to increase children’s environmental knowledge and understanding, while inspiring and providing opportunities for positive environmental and sustainability action.

Kids in Action was a chance for students to get together with other like-minded kids in their community to spread knowledge, understanding and passion for the environment.

Due to the difficult year we all experienced last year, our theme this year focused on hope and how we might ‘Future Dream’ to imagine new ways of journeying towards sustainability together.

For the last two terms, students have been exploring elements connected to the theme and at the conference, had the opportunity to teach other students and share their knowledge and learnings.

As the sun started to shine, students had the chance to explore ‘Peregian Emu Dreaming’ workshop from Peregian Springs State School, ‘The Wheel of Wellbeing Framework’ workshop from North Arm State School, ‘Bees in Action – The importance of bees now and for the future’ workshop from Maleny State High School, as well as plenty of other topics and workshops.

Their projects were guided by First Nation and community mentors, and of course the teachers, who council thanks for their support.
