Whether you are a pet owner or not, Sunshine Coast Council wants your input on a new *Domestic Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Plan 2021 – 2030* that will guide responsible pet ownership across the region for the next 10 years.

In August 2020, council asked the community for their thoughts on responsible pet ownership and more than 1000 residents completed a survey.

The information gathered through the survey has helped to shape the *Draft* *Domestic Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Plan 2021-2030,* including its goal and desired outcomes.

The plan’s goal is to create a *harmonious co-existence between people, pets and places* and to achieve the outcomes of Educated Informed People, Happy Healthy Pets and Safe Inclusive Places.

Council is now asking residents to review the draft plan, make sure we’ve got it right, and provide ideas on actions to help achieve the goals and outcomes.

Service Excellence Portfolio Councillor Winston Johnston said council recognised that people had different connections with pets.

“For many people, they are more than just a pet – they offer companionship and are part of the family,” Cr Johnston said.

“However, we also acknowledge that some people prefer to enjoy places that are pet free.

“This is why we are inviting every community member, whether you are a pet owner or not, to have your say on the new draft plan.”

The survey feedback will be used to finalise the draft plan and action plan before being presented to council for adoption in mid-2021.

Have your say via the [survey on council’s website](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CKPC527)
. A plan summary, the full draft plan and the survey can be found on council’s Have Your Say website - <https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/dams>
.

The survey is also available at libraries, vets, community centres and through education pop-up stalls being held across the region from February through to the end of March. Check the website for locations and details on the pop-up stalls.

The survey will close on March 31, 2021.

The updated plan is also guided by the Queensland Government *Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008* and Sunshine Coast Council *Local Law and Subordinate Local Law No. 2* and will incorporate council’s activities in relation to lost and roaming pets, surrendered pets, the animal pound, rehoming pets and animal welfare.
