*Changing Perceptions of Homelessness* by Claire Letitia Reynolds will be on display at the Maroochydore Library Artspace from Monday, September 19 to Saturday, October 29.

The photographs in this exhibition aim to challenge and change current perceptions and associated stigma surrounding homelessness. 

Caloundra Regional Gallery in collaboration with Sunshine Coast Libraries will present the exhibition at Maroochydore Library Artspace.

Caloundra Regional Gallery Director Jo Duke said galleries and cultural spaces were important places for telling both sad and uplifting stories.

“This exhibition really does both and is very moving,” Ms Duke said.

“With glimpses into the lives of people who are often the voiceless, forgotten and who populate the edges of the society, this exhibition helps break down the barrier between and hopefully creates a space for people to see, to hear and rethink what it means to part of a community.

“A big thankyou to the Nambour Community Centre’s Ana Greenfield and the participants for bringing together such a compelling exhibition.”

You’re invited to the official launch on Friday, September 23 from 1-3pm. Please register on [Council’s website](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/EVSESENQ?SETLVL=&RNI=5435556)
