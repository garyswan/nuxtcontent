Sunshine Coast Council is calling for suitably qualified and experienced operators to tender for the leases and management of the Caloundra and Cotton Tree Aquatic Centres.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said tenders for both aquatic centres were open until April 26, with a start date of July 01, 2022.

“The [Caloundra](http://www.caloundra-aquatic.com.au/)
&#x20;and [Cotton Tree Aquatic Centres](https://www.swimfit.com.au/cotton-tree)
&#x20;are both hugely popular council owned facilities which offer a wide range of activities to the Sunshine Coast Community, from learn-to-swim classes and aqua aerobics right through to experienced squad level swimming,” Cr Law said.

“Opportunities for a new operator to run one or both of these facilities are open and interested parties can submit their expressions of interest through the [Qtenders website](https://qtenders.hpw.qld.gov.au/qtenders/tender/search/tender-search.do?CSRFNONCE=5FCF1147DDBD836A9B8B536E1EF5AC41&action=do-advanced-tender-search&changeLevel=&inputlist=hasETB&orderBy=&withdrawalReason=&expiredReason=&tenderState=&tenderId=&page=1&keywords=&anyWord=anyWord&tenderCode=&tenderTitle=&state=Open&type=Any&selectedMegaCategory=-1&unspscCode1=&issuingBusinessId=27®ionId=-1&dateOpeningIndex=1&openingDateFromString=&openingDateToString=&dateClosingIndex=1&closingDateFromString=&closingDateToString=&dateAwardedIndex=1&awardedDateFromString=&awardedDateToString=&ageRestriction=0&groupBy=None&as_sfid=AAAAAAVoql4UKpkYgG1DuzcIiJ5_SZFQJa8jRPgybAvgeqDWEJA2xobrGNcM_z2IUuSI4BS_sZyts6W4J9DsQsRKnECLBBYe8Nkhmb8JXa3vkA-5zOA0atmU8K-8ajLPF7TvW2o%3D&as_fid=edbd4dc96622b2e00fe5cef5ea14bb5895ac20f0)
.

“Following 37 years of outstanding service, the Caloundra Aquatic Centre will farewell long-term lessee [John Wallace](https://oursc.com.au/community/leading-sunshine-coast-aquatic-coach-dives-into-retirement-after-37-years)
&#x20;on May 31,” Cr Law said.

“Council will take this opportunity between leases to deliver essential capital works upgrades to this much-loved community facility throughout June, during the cooler winter period.

Caloundra Aquatic Centre

“During this time, the Caloundra Aquatic Centre will be temporarily closed from June 1 - 30 to enable repair and maintenance works to be undertaken. We look forward to reopening the centre on Friday July 1, 2022.

“The popular adjoining skate park will no longer form part of the Caloundra Aquatic Centre lease.

“It will be returned to the community for free access from July 1 also following some minor works.”
