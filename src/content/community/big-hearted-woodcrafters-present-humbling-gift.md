Since 1996 the Blackall Range Woodcrafter’s Guild, also known as the ‘Woodies’, have been shaving, chipping and polishing away at their craft.

The group brings together many from all walks of life who share a passion for wood crafting.

For the past 26 years, members have been using their free time to access timber and tools to give back to those in need.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston recognised the ‘Woodies’ compassion and skill with a discretionary grant.

At Wednesday’s historic first Ordinary Meeting at Sunshine Coast City Hall, grateful group members showed their gratitude with a special gift to Council of a hand-made gavel set that Cr Johnston said was “a humbling experience”.

Cr Johnston praised the Woodies for their commitment to brightening the lives of others.

“The woodworkers are renowned for using their hands to build beautiful jewellery boxes, grand pieces of furniture and fine art sculptures.

“What many of us don’t know is that since inception, the ‘Woodies’ have donated hundreds of wooden toys to the Salvation Army Christmas Toy Appeal for distribution to children and families to spread a little joy during difficult times.

“The Blackall Range Woodcrafter’s Guild received a grant of $2000 from the Division 5 Discretionary Fund to assist with the upgrade of a solar kiln used for drying timber.

“The ‘Woodies’ informed me the upgrade is well underway and I’m looking forward to checking out the talent at an upcoming timber sale or exhibition.”

Blackall Range Woodcrafter’s Guild President Julie Breen said the guild appreciated Councillor Johnston and Council’s support over the years.

“These grants have enabled the Woodies to handmake woodcraft for other community groups on the Sunshine Coast and this new upgraded kiln has members very excited,”

“Woodworking gives us a place where we can slow down, pay attention, and take the time to create something new, and make new mates!

“Our community welcomes all levels of experience and generations to give it ago – beginners can learn from experienced woodworkers through a range of workshops and events.”
