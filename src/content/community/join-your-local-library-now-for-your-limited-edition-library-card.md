Sunshine Coast locals can receive a special limited edition First Nations library card during National Reconciliation Week, May 27 – June 3.

The two available designs feature beautiful artworks by Kabi Kabi artists.

These offer a glimpse of the ancient knowledge and stories of our First Nations peoples.

New library members can choose between Kane Brunjes’s *Guidance Through Country,* which details the brown snake with line work influenced from the Bunya pine showing the strength and beauty in Country.

National Reconciliation Week is a time to learn about shared histories, cultures, and achievements. This year’s theme *Be a Voice for Generations* calls for all Australians to be a voice for reconciliation in our everyday lives.
