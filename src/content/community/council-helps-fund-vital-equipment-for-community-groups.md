Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Grants Program is set to continue helping local community organisations with more than $96,000 awarded in the most recent round.

Fifty-seven community groups have been able to undertake upgrades, purchase equipment, supply training for volunteers and deliver local community programs thanks to Council’s Minor Grants Program.

Suncoast Spinners Wheelchair Basketball Inc. was awarded a Minor Grant of $2000 to help purchase equipment, including portable junior basketball hoops, training vests and referee whistles to support the weekly kids’ club wheelchair basketball program at USC stadium.

Suncoast Spinners Wheelchair Basketball Inc. Secretary Sharon Hill thanked Sunshine Coast Council for helping fund the equipment purchase.

“The funding the club received will go towards the Suncoast Spinners Kids Club Program, which is a program that promotes the health and wellbeing of children with a disability to stay fit and active, as well as a way to make connection with the community outside of school hours,” Ms Hill said.

“The grant will help with the purchase of age-appropriate equipment, including a set of junior basketball portable hoop stands.

“The weekly kids’ club provides access to social sport, normalising wheelchair sport and encourages participations by children aged four to 14 with and without disability.”

Community Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski congratulated all the grant recipients for applying for Council’s Minor Grants round.

“It is wonderful to see the variety of community organisations and the different ways they contribute and make the Sunshine Coast a vibrant and creative place to live,” Cr Baberowski said.

“I look forward to seeing all the improvements, workshops and new equipment across the Sunshine Coast.”

Other recipient organisations include:

*   Chancellor Park Soccer Club - $2000 towards the purchase and installation of a water bubbler
*   Buddina Community Garden Inc - $1996 toward the preparation of garden beds and planting of trees, shrubs and ground covers along southern side of garden
*   Sunshine Coast Dragon Boat and Outrigger Canoe Club Inc - $1895 to purchase a defibrillator for the club.

The total value of community projects in this funding round is $284,418, of which $96,502 is contributed to by Sunshine Coast Council.

Funding categories include community development, community facilities, creative development, cultural heritage, economic development and sport and recreation.

Community groups organising Christmas, New Year, Australia Day, ANZAC Day or Remembrance Day community events can apply online for a [Festive and Commemorative Events Grant](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Grants-and-Funding/Grants-Programs/Festive-and-Commemorative-Events-Grants)
