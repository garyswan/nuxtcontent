It’s Homelessness Week this week (August 1-7) and Sunshine Coast residents are being encouraged to learn more about homelessness and its causes and perhaps consider becoming a volunteer at one of the many organisations helping the most vulnerable in our community.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said homelessness was a complex issue that required a comprehensive response from all levels of government, service providers, community organisations and our community.

“Many local community services and centres are supported by volunteers and there are opportunities for many to lend a hand,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“Council has developed the [Sunshine Coast Housing and Homelessness Directory](https://d1j8a4bqwzee3.cloudfront.net/~/media/Corporate/Documents/Community/210048B_%20Housing%20and%20Homelessness%20Directory_2021_Directory_FINAL.pdf?la=en)
, a pocket-sized guide which contains details of organisations that are providing services to people at risk of homelessness and those who are currently experiencing homelessness.

“There may be an organisation in the directory our residents would like to reach out to.

“Council continues to work with State and Federal governments and support the Sunshine Coast Housing & Homelessness Network to help develop action plans to address this issue on the Sunshine Coast.

“We are also liaising with stakeholders to start developing a Housing & Homelessness Action Plan.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said maintaining the Sunshine Coast’s liveability was recognised in the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

“This strategy seeks to create a strong community that is informed and feels empowered to respond to local issues together and address challenges in partnership, collaboration, advocacy and direct action,” Cr Law said.

“This includes homelessness.

“In Australia, there are more than 116,000 experiencing homelessness on any given night. Together we can do something about that.

“Education is important and the [Homelessness Australia](https://homelessnessaustralia.org.au/)
&#x20;website can help all of us learn more about, and become involved in, campaigns to end homelessness and how we as individuals and organisations can make a difference.”
