True crime fans will need to move quickly to secure tickets to this one-night-only event where authors will delve into a gripping podcast that smashed all records.

Join author and journalist Hedley Thomas and investigative journalist Matthew Condon for an in-conversation event on Thursday, April 20, as the pair deep dive \_The Teacher’s Pet, The Teacher’s Trial\_ and *Shandee’s Story* *podcasts.*

This will include discussions about the latest fallout from Queensland’s DNA lab inquiry. 

Matthew and Hedley will reflect on Hedley’s incredible personal and professional journey during the *Teacher’s Pet* podcast, which led to the arrest, trial and conviction of Chris Dawson, who lived on the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said libraires were renowned for hosting some of Australia’s favourite writing talents and this in-conversation event was not to be missed.

“Come along and hear first-hand the behind-the-scenes details about Hedley’s five true crime podcasts, which reached a global audience of 80 million downloads and climbing,” Cr Law said.

“Local artist Hayden Hack, an award-winning songwriter and musician will provide the evening’s entertainment. Get your tickets quick, as this is sure to be a sellout event.”
