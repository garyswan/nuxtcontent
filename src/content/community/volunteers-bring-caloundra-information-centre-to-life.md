More than 40 local volunteers have put their hand up to man the new Community Information Centre which officially opened on Bulcock Street today (10 May).

Armed with a passion for Caloundra and a willingness to lend a hand, the group of volunteers are ready to provide tourist information, directions and local event information to visitors and locals alike, seven days a week.

Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said today’s opening is the result of a great partnership between Sunshine Coast Council, Caloundra Tourism the local business community and the fantastic volunteers that have stepped up to run the centre.

“The Caloundra community expressed a need for an information centre and I’m extremely proud to be here today to launch this important facility at 77 Bulcock Street.

“Beyond the great intel that the centre will provide to all who stop by, the delivery of this service reinforces the collaborative efforts of all groups working to help Caloundra succeed.

“The Caloundra Community Information Centre will help our community and visitors alike, to really capitalise on all that Caloundra has to offer, thereby strengthening the local economy,” Cr Landsberg said.

Caloundra Tourism Chair John Orning acknowledged that Caloundra, in particular Bulcock Street, had experienced a bumper holiday season which had increased demand for an information centre.

“The Centre, and the great local knowledge of the volunteers who will run it, will be a great help to businesses in the area, informing visitors where to eat, stay, explore and shop.

“We are happy to have worked with Sunshine Coast Council to get the Caloundra Community Information Centre open,” Mr Orning said. 

The new Caloundra Community Information Centre is located at 77 Bulcock St and will operate from 9am-3pm Monday to Friday and 10am to 1pm weekends and public holidays.

If you would like to volunteer, please visit the centre.
