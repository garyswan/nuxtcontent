Kudos to our Botanic Gardens BushCare group which has grown from 7 BushCarers to 15 in the last 12 months.

New volunteers are welcome and it’s amazing what can be achieved with some extra help!

In one day's work, the team cleared the creek which was full of lantana, revealing some hidden gems.

They uncovered a beautiful little frog gulley and some stag horns, and were treated to fresh native raspberries as they worked to the sound of croaking tusked frogs.

Our Twin Waters Dune Protection Group have also been hard at work.

Recently they had 10 volunteers plant 150 native trees in the dunes at Mudjimba.

This part of the dune lacks canopy structure and their efforts should see this restored over time as the plants establish.

These community volunteers are from two of 40 groups who volunteer their time to conserve and restore our Sunshine Coast bushland in council’s environmental reserves.

No commitment is required, and you can join-in where and when you can.

Visit council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Environment/Get-Involved-in-Conservation/BushCare-Sunshine-Coast/BushCare-Community)
&#x20;to discover how you can get involved.
