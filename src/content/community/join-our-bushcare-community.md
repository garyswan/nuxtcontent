Do you love helping our environment? Meeting likeminded people? Staying healthy and active in the great outdoors?

Then we invite you to join your local BushCare Sunshine Coast group in 2023.

Our beautiful bushland reserves are part of what make the Sunshine Coast so special.

This year, join a team of volunteers who look after their local bushland.

From the coastline to the hinterland, there are forty groups waiting for you to join, with regular working bees year long.

No commitment necessary - join-in where and when you can.
