A new four-lane bridge is scheduled to open by the end of this year (weather permitting) and will reduce traffic congestion and enhance the arrival experience into Mooloolaba.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said construction for Stages 2 and 3 of the Brisbane Road Upgrade, which will see Brisbane Road’s two lanes expanded to four, was continuing despite the recent wet weather which had seen more than 1.7m of rain fall across Mooloolaba from January to June.

“We have reached a really exciting halfway mark this month with two of the Mayes Canal bridge’s four lanes open to traffic,” Cr Natoli said.

“If you’re on your way into Mooloolaba or heading south along Brisbane Road, you’ll see cars ‘switched’ to the new bridge lanes – operating one lane in each direction.

“The switch will not require any further changes to traffic conditions. Motorists will veer slightly to the east, onto the new lanes.

“This will allow the old bridge to be demolished and the remaining two new lanes constructed over the next few months.

“The new bridge will maintain the same height clearance as the current bridge and be a 26.4-metre-wide, four-lane bridge with shared pedestrian and cycle paths on both sides.

“For safety reasons, until the new pedestrian and cycle paths are built on both sides of the new bridge, pedestrians will be diverted to the nearby walk-and-ride bridge over Mayes Canal, about 100-150 metres away.”

Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade is an important transport project which will improve safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, improve traffic flow, reduce delays during peak periods and cater for future traffic growth.

Construction on Stages 2 and 3 started in May 2021 and includes the widening of Brisbane Road from two lanes to four lanes between Walan Street and Kyamba Court, on-road cycle treatments, intersection upgrades, landscaping and the new Mayes Canal Bridge.

These works are benefitting from a $12 million investment from the Australian Government through the $4 billion Urban Congestion Fund.

Federal Member for Fisher Andrew Wallace MP said the bridge formed a key part of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade, reducing the bottleneck at the existing Mayes Canal Bridge.

“This is about getting families home sooner and safer as well as improving access to Mooloolaba and its incredible small and family businesses,” Mr Wallace said.

“I was proud to secure funding to deliver this project for Fisher, which will benefit locals and visitors alike.

“Just as with our Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, the Coalition Federal Government was able to partner with council to build the infrastructure our rapidly growing community needs.”

Once completed it will accommodate anticipated growth in traffic generated by residents, businesses and the attraction of Mooloolaba’s natural features, with daily trips expected to increase from around 61,000 today to more than 90,000 in 2041.

To assist with traffic flow, a temporary northbound lane has been provided on Hancock Street daily until 17 July and then each Friday through Sunday until the Walan Street-Hancock Street-Brisbane Road intersection reopens.

Council will continue to make every effort to minimise impacts to the local community and businesses during construction and thanks the community for their patience during this major construction project.
