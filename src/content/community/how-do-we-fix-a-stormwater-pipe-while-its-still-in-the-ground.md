Digging up and replacing a broken or damaged stormwater pipe can be very expensive and complicated.

When possible Council tries to avoid digging up and replacing damaged stormwater pipes by relining the inside of the pipe with a structural liner. This process does not require the stormwater pipe to be removed, and minimises costs and disruption to the community.

Pipe relining can extend the life of a pipe by up to 50 years.

Take a look at the before and after shots of a pipe that we relined.

With an aging stormwater network and the degradation of concrete pipes in our coastal environments, pipe relining is an important tool used by Council to provide a sustainable and functional stormwater network.

If you see a blocked or broken stormwater pit or pipe, please contact Council on 5475 7272.

HAVE YOUR SAY

To help ensure we have an integrated stormwater network that is effective, sustainable and contributes to waterway health, Council has developed the Draft Stormwater Management Strategy and is now seeking community feedback.

Visit [Council’s website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stormwater-management-strategy-sms)
&#x20;to have your say by 5pm Friday 14 May.
