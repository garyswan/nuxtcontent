Forget the cold snap, a range of low-cost holistic activities are in full swing this winter thanks to Sunshine Coast Council’s popular health and wellbeing program.

Local residents can be part of Council’s Healthy Sunshine Coast for less than a cup of coffee\* and embark on a healthier and happier lifestyle with group fitness classes, yoga, nutrition presentations, mindfulness sessions, and much more.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the program focused on the key pillars of active living, healthy eating, connecting with others, mindfulness and mental wellness.

### “We want to inspire and empower our Sunshine Coast residents to lead healthier lives,” Cr Law said.

“Through a variety of engaging activities and resources, Healthy Sunshine Coast – which is now in its seventh year – aims to make health and wellness accessible and enjoyable for all residents.

“It provides opportunities for individuals of all ages and abilities to participate in activities, ranging from pilates and aqua aerobics to nature events that celebrate the natural beauty of our region.

“The program also offers educational sessions and workshops on healthy eating habits, nutrition, and sustainable food practices, fostering a community that values a wholesome and healthy lifestyle.

“We recognise the importance of mental wellbeing and the Healthy Sunshine Coast Program provides resources and support to help individuals manage stress, build resilience and prioritise self-care.”

Sue Moore, Healthy Sunshine Coast provider of ‘\_The Practice of Mindfulness for Stress Reduction\_’ sessions said nowadays people tended to live faster-paced lives with many commitments which could increase our stress levels.

“By practising mindfulness techniques throughout the day, it can be an effective mental health practice for helping people improve their overall wellbeing,” Ms Moore said.

“Some of the benefits include decreasing depression, anxiety, and stress as well as improving your memory and strengthening your relationships.”

### Attend a session at the Caloundra CWA Hall on Mondays at 5.30pm. Visit [Council’s website](https://sunshine-coast-council.trumba.com/healthy-sunshine-coast/The-Practice-of-Mindfulness-for-Stress-Reduction/E167108132)
