Sliding off the back of a vibrant new splash park, the thrills just keep on coming with a soaring new hinterland playground attraction.

The next stage of Nambour’s Quota Memorial Park improvements started in August and is generating a lot of excitement for some of our region’s littlest residents.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said the upgrades to the junior and toddler play space were very impressive and complemented the Coast’s newest community water park.

“Both the Nambour Aquatic Centre [Splash Park](https://oursc.com.au/community/wave-of-visitors-set-to-slide-into-nambours-vibrant-new-splash-park)
, which offers more than 580 square metres of active water play, and the new adventure playground at Quota Memorial Park provide hours of family fun and are attracting even more visitors to the region’s hinterland heart,” Cr Law said.

“There’s a huge seven metres high ‘Spire Gear Tower’, contoured rock wall, climbing rope net, banister slide, internal climbers with various levels of challenge, a rope elevator, and a huge spiral slide – it’s the energy boost this park needed.

“The park’s refresh complements the new 1.7-hectare open space park extension which was part of Stage 1 works completed in January 2022.

“This popular park is great for families with varying aged children and has been redesigned so the layout is accessible for all and includes rubber soft fall in and around all the play elements.

“Make sure you point out the various sized ‘gears’ on the outside of the tower to your children and the skate park’s cog from the mill – the park has a meaningful connection to 1894 Moreton Central Sugar Mill which was a big part of Nambour’s history.

“I’ve been watching the works take place and I’m really pleased with the transformation and am sure the community will enjoy seeing the space turned into a green, family-friendly area for everyone to enjoy.”

The view lines between the Youth Activity Precinct and the junior and toddler play spaces have been improved by replacing the picket-style fence with a pool-style fence. The tower’s bubble windows, hole panels, and rope elevator also allow parents and carers to see into the tower for supervision.

The park is boasting a green injection with an additional four shade trees planted around the playground, and an additional shade sail has also been installed.

This project is part of the Petrie Creek Parklands Open Space Master Plan which was endorsed by council in late 2017 and delivers on council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy to provide long-term direction to guide growth and shape the future of our region.
