Whether you’re heading on a camping trip, or camping out at home these school holidays, Sunshine Coast Council Libraries have created a range of activities for you to enjoy. 

Register to secure an “At Home Holiday Camping Activity Pack” that includes cool resources like a paddle ball, miniature puzzle cube or slinky, activity book from Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, paper airplane and chatterbox templates.

Age limits apply for these packs as they’ve been designed to suit specific age groups and respond to children’s motor and literacy skills, as well as their developmental age.

To book your activity pack visit the Library website: library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au – bookings will be taken from 5pm Monday 22 March. The packs will be available for collection from Saturday 27 March.

And don’t forget, no matter where you are spending the holidays, you can also access the large range of online programs published every Monday for all ages in the What’s On section of the library website.

The programs include learning bush survival skills, learning new songs and games for camping trips and discovering Aussie legends of the outback.

Or, why not become a certified Shark Legend with Ocean Life Education’s *Amazing Sharks* - online course – learn the facts, bust the myths and help protect these totally awesome creatures. 

While you can also stream music and movies via our eLibrary for free, if you’re on the Sunshine Coast, take some time out to visit your local library – to borrow books, magazines, DVDs and board games. To find a Library near you, visit the [Library website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
