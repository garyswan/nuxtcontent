High in the hinterland Maleny is known for its picture-perfect dairy country, rainforests and artisan boutiques lining Maple Street.

It’s a place much-loved by locals and visitors year-round, which is why Sunshine Coast Council is asking the community for their [feedback](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/maleny-placemaking-and-streetscape-project)
&#x20;on minor improvements to Maple Street to ensure it remains bustling and welcoming for all.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 5 Councillor Winston Johnston said he looked forward to hearing the community’s feedback on how to make Maple Street even sweeter.

“In 2005 Council developed the Maleny Maple Street Streetscape Concept Plan which was shaped by community feedback, now we ask the community what stages they would like Council to prioritise next,” Cr Johnston said.

“The Maple Street Streetscape area extends from Myrtle Street to the Obi Obi Creek Bridge and includes a variety of community spaces.

*Maleny’s main thoroughfare Maple Street*.

“Since the concept plan was developed, council has upgraded the Coral and Maple streets roundabout, undertaken streetscape improvement works along Coral and Fig streets, upgraded the Teak and Maple streets intersection and made Cooke Park frontage more welcoming.

“The design was developed through a process of extensive consultation and cultural mapping which revealed the character of the streetscape upgrade should be unique to Maleny and incorporate the artistic, rural, historical, cooperative and organic nature of the community.

“We aren’t looking to change the character of the town, but to continue to improve the long-term amenity of the street, create more community gathering points and reinforce a sense of place for the community.

“We understand there has been some years between the first round of streetscape improvements, which is why we seek to understand the key areas of Maple Street the community believe need to be focused on next.

“Council also wants to know if the concept design needs any updating to meet the values and vision of the current and future community.

“I encourage the community to provide further feedback until August 15, 2022, via an [online survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/maleny-placemaking-and-streetscape-project)
&#x20;or email submission.”

The feedback obtained during the consultation period will allow council to better understand the preferences of the community.

Some elements shown in the concept plan may be considered with future project budgets. The community engagement process will seek to prioritise the most important improvements to make within the available budget.
