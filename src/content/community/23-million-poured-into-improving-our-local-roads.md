For the past 10 years, Council’s civil engineer Tim Stabler has been working in the Civil Asset Management team.

Unsure of what a civil asset is? If you can drive on it, sit on it and walk on it, chances are it's a civil asset.

Tim looks after all transport assets including Bridges, Retaining Walls, Pathways and Kerb and Channel.

The Mooloolaba Mayes Canal Bridge in the background of the lead photo is one of the many projects which need Asset Strategy engineers to inspect new structures for the purpose of ensuring quality and durability.

The Asset team also oversaw the February Flood Event management for QLD Reconstruction Authority for Claims including procurement of consultants for defect capture, landslip risk analysis, design and estimation.

The team plays a critical role in keeping our community safe on our roads all year round.

**Did you know?**

Between April to June 2022, $4.4 million was invested into our road network, rehabilitating and resurfacing 10.8 kilometres of local roads to improve community safety.

Almost $23 million was invested on a total of 83.5 kilometres of roads across our region in the 2021–22 financial year – that’s 641,418m².

This year’s completed works are an increase of 29 kilometres on the prior year.
