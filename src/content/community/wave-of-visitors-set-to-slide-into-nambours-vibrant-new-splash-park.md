The Sunshine Coast’s newest community water park is set to attract even more visitors to the region’s hinterland heart - offering more than 580 square metres of healthy and active water play for people of all ages and abilities.

Sunshine Coast Council officially unveiled the vibrant $3.26 million Nambour Aquatic Centre Splash Park today, Friday 16 September with the new adventure water slides open to the community from Saturday 17 September.

“There has been an incredible appetite for the new Splash Park,” Cr Law said.

“The zero-depth [splash pad](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Nambour-makes-a-splash-with-kids-new-water-wonderland-180122)
&#x20;has been a major drawcard since opening earlier this year with little ones thoroughly enjoying water play, even during Queensland’s cooler months.

“With warmer weather approaching and the addition of two huge water slides, I imagine thrill-seekers of all ages will welcome a plunge at this great facility.\
“As well as providing hours of family fun, the Splash Park encourages children’s physical and sensory development through interaction with water play elements.

“Together with the existing 50-metre lap pool and 25 metre indoor pool, I believe the Nambour Aquatic Centre has set a new benchmark for community waterparks in our region.”

Member for Nicklin Rob Skelton said the Palaszczuk Government was delivering for Nambour and the Sunshine Coast through the Works for Queensland Program.

“We’re committed to Nambour and the greater Sunshine Coast, investing in new facilities to create jobs and improve the already fantastic lifestyle of locals,” Mr Skelton said.

“Nambour is one of the best places to live in Queensland, and for young families it’s even better now with the opening of this Splash Park.

“The Palaszczuk Government has invested more than $1.05 million and created more than 24 good local jobs building the Splash Park.

“Now that it’s completed, local families are able to come and enjoy this wonderful new facility.”  

Belgravia Leisure’s Queensland State Manager Dan Cullen said he was thrilled to welcome the community back to the Nambour Aquatic Centre.

“Mark your diary for our family-friendly celebration on Saturday, September 17, featuring free entry to the aquatic centre and unlimited use of the adventure water slides for $6.50 per person,” Mr Cullen said.

“There will also be a Welcome to Country by the Gubbi Gubbi Dyungungoo Group Inc, free cultural workshops, community stalls, Nambour Swim Club Swimathon, Learn to Swim and Squad assessments, come and try aqua aerobics classes and our popular inflatable course.”

Entry to the zero-depth splash pad is included in the standard pool admission price and available seven days a week.

Unlimited access to the two adventure water slides is $6.50 per person, in addition to the standard pool admission price.

During school holidays, the slides will be open Monday to Sunday, 10.30am to 3pm, while during the school term, slide access will be available on Saturday and Sunday, 10.30am to 3pm.

The $3.26 million Nambour Aquatic Centre Splash Park was developed with the support of the Queensland Government’s Works for Queensland program in association with Sunshine Coast Council, and pool lessee Belgravia Leisure.
