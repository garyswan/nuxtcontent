A flag-raising ceremony, family fun day and a captivating exhibition are just some of the activities taking place during NAIDOC Week festivities this year (4-11 July).

The theme for NAIDOC Week is *Heal Country!* and calls on everyone to continue seeking greater protections for our lands, waters, sacred sites and cultural heritage.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said he was pleased council’s annual flag-raising ceremony was able to go ahead in light of the pandemic and recent lock down, with NAIDOC Week celebrations returned to July this year.

“NAIDOC Week is always an important time for our community to acknowledge and attribute respect to the elders past and present of our First Nations peoples,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“One of my enduring priorities since I was elected as Mayor in 2012 has been to advancing reconciliation and strengthening our collaboration with our First Nations communities across many facets of our work.

“This is one of the founding principles that underpinned our council’s Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan 2021-2022, which our council unanimously endorsed in March this year.

“An important part of that work has focused on developing a culturally capable workplace at council, promoting respect and valuing the skills, experience and perspectives of First Nations employees and representatives in our community.”

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law invited the community to join in many activities to mark the occasion. 

“There are plenty of activities on offer for people to connect, celebrate and share stories locally about what ‘country’ means, as it is inherent to the identity of our First Nations peoples,” Cr Law said.

“For many, ‘country’ is more than a place and more like a person in a spiritual, physical, emotional and cultural sense.”

The annual flag-raising ceremony will be livestreamed on council’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SunshineCoastCouncil)
.

*   **Award Winning First Nations virtual reality at Bankfoot House, ongoing each Wednesday-Sunday 10am-3pm**

First Nations at Bankfoot House is the first virtual reality (VR) experience presented by Sunshine Coast Council and Bilbie Virtual Studios. 

This VR experience is an integral component in telling the story of the Glass House Mountains region and combines moving image, sound and interactive design. Transporting the viewer through time, the experience unveils a deeply engaging way to immerse visitors in the world of First Nations people before the establishment of Bankfoot House.

Visitors engage with Elders who lead them on a quest to complete tasks, and in doing so reveal insights into daily life, culture, ceremony, and environment. The VR took more than 12 months to create and involved collaboration with Kabi Kabi and Jinibara Traditional Custodians.

Kabi Kabi and Jinibara First Nations people present a unique and fun filled day of cultural learning with traditional games, dancing, and craft workshops for children of all ages.
