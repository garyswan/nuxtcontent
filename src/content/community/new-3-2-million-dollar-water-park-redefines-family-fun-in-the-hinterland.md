A vibrant new water park has opened in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, attracting more than 4,000 visitors on the school holiday opening weekend.

The $3.2 million dollar Nambour Aquatic Centre Splash Park now features more than 580 square metres of exciting waterplay for people of all ages and abilities.

Sunshine Coast residents and locals lapped up the new waterpark at the weekend, taking full advantage of the new zero-depth and fully accessible splash pad, toddler slides, water jet features, tipping buckets, and two giant adventure water slides measuring 60 and 67 metres in length.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said the new Splash Park was already attracting visitors from across the region and redefining ‘family fun’ in the hinterland.

“The Nambour Splash Park has provided an incredible opportunity for our community to access some of the region’s most exciting community waterplay facilities – right here in the heart of the hinterland,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This will be a meeting place for many families for years to come, connecting our communities and enhancing the active and healthy lifestyle that we enjoy most.”

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law who attended the community opening celebration said he was thrilled to see the Splash Park being enjoyed at long last.

“It was absolutely incredible,” Cr Law said.

“Eager thrill-seekers of all ages have welcomed a plunge at this great new facility, with a strong flow of visitors all day.

“The community is so thankful for this wonderful new attraction, and it is truly a delight to see the joy it brings.

“Together with the existing 50-metre lap pool and 25 metre indoor pool, I believe the Nambour Aquatic Centre has set a new benchmark for community waterparks in our region.”

Member for Nicklin Rob Skelton said the Palaszczuk Government was delivering for Nambour and the Sunshine Coast through the Works for Queensland Program.

“We’re committed to Nambour and the greater Sunshine Coast, investing in new facilities to create jobs and improve the already fantastic lifestyle of locals,” Mr Skelton said.

“Nambour is one of the best places to live in Queensland, and for young families it’s even better now with the opening of this Splash Park.”

Entry to the zero-depth splash pad is included in the standard pool admission price and available seven days a week.

Unlimited access to the two adventure water slides is $6.50 per person, in addition to the standard pool admission price.

During school holidays, the slides will be open Monday to Sunday, 10.30am to 3pm, while during the school term, slide access will be available on Saturday and Sunday, 10.30am to 3pm.

The $3.26 million Nambour Aquatic Centre [Splash Park](https://oursc.com.au/community/wave-of-visitors-set-to-slide-into-nambours-vibrant-new-splash-park)
