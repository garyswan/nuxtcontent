Tomorrow (April 25) we remember all Australians and New Zealanders who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations. Lest we Forget.

Watch the video to see how Harrison Sutcliffe shared his connection to Anzac Day last year.

Harrison honoured his Great-Great Grandfather John Jack Hall, whom served as a trumpeter for his infantry at Gallipoli.

RSL Australia is encouraging everyone to honour defence men and women in a way that is meaningful to them.

They are calling on all Australians to take the time to commemorate – whether at a march, an Anzac Day service or by lighting up the dawn at home.
