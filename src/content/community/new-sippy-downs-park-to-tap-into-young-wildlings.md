Located right in the centre of a growing community, the new Sippy Downs Forest Park will soon spring from the ground, providing shaded meadows, forest experiences, an outdoor classroom and social spaces for all to enjoy.

The forest park is part of the emerging, medium-density development between the Sunshine Motorway and Sippy Downs Drive.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said he was excited to deliver a recreation park which serviced the needs of the expanding community.

“I’m very pleased to see preliminary site works, on what will be another embellished District Park for the Sippy Downs community, now underway,” Cr Dickson said.

“This intimate forest experience and recreation opportunity also encourages surrounding suburbs to enjoy the outdoors, and is suitable for all ages and abilities.

“The park will provide a forest experience that supports active and passive recreation opportunities, a mixture of established trees and open spaces, social spaces for barbecues, a variety of natural seating options and even an informal outdoor classroom area.

“A word of warning to parents – children are likely to turn into mini-Tarzans, as one of the three nature-based play areas is a three-level tower, elevated in the tree canopy!

“The tree top tower was inspired by lofty trees and the creeping vines that surround them, giving users a bird-like feeling of being among the trees, looking across the forest park from their perch or nest.”

Sippy Downs Forest Park is a vegetated heart which will provide visual respite from the urban environment.

Community feedback received during the development of the Sunshine Coast Recreation Parks Plan was incorporated into the forest park’s planning and design.

Sunshine Coast Council Environment Portfolio Councillor Maria Suarez said outdoor spaces were vitally important as the Sunshine Coast became Australia’s most sustainable region: healthy, smart and creative.

“Feedback translated into the design of the park includes shaded places to gather with friends and family, and play spaces that integrate with the natural landscape that encourages our community to explore the park,” Cr Suarez said.

“The park’s design addresses several goals identified in our Recreation Parks Plan including increasing opportunities to connect with nature in cooler, vegetated spaces.

“It’s so important that our designers create gathering spaces which link people and place, foster community cohesiveness and improve mental health.”

The shelters and amenities have been designed to be contemporary yet complement the natural surrounds: soft curves visually tie in with the trunks of trees and the colour palette references the charred logs and tree trunks within the site.

Preliminary site works started on May 16 with construction of the park expected to start early June, weather permitting.

The west and east park lots will be completed late-November 2022, weather permitting.  The middle section of parkland will be completed at a future stage and is subject to funding.  

Connecting pathways and discovery trails will also be interconnected throughout the forest park once the future stages of works are completed, providing for great bird watching and learning experiences.
