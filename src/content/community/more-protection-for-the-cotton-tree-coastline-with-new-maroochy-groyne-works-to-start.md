Sunshine Coast Council will start coastal protection works on Stage 2 of the Maroochy Groyne Field Renewal project next week to help shield the Cotton Tree foreshore from the current and future impacts of coastal erosion.

Stage 1 of the award-winning\* project was completed in 2020.

This second stage will see approximately 2000 sand-filled geotextile bags laid in formation to make up the renewed groynes which interrupt wave action, capture sand and provide an erosion buffer to protect the Cotton Tree coastline and adjacent holiday park.

Having housed four geoxtile groynes for almost 20 years, the Cotton Tree coastline was identified for renewal in 2017 as part of council’s Shoreline Erosion Management Plan.

Following extensive community consultation – and the formation of the Maroochy River Estuary Consultation Group – it was determined the aged groynes would be replaced with new sand-filled geotextile bags.

These bags will use sand sourced directly from the Cotton Tree site, and the sand from previous bags will be used to replenish the beach.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the Sunshine Coast had more than 100km of coastal foreshores.

“This includes many world-class beaches and iconic rocky headlands, some managed by council,” Cr Natoli said.

“Renewal projects such as this ensure our much-loved local coastlines, beaches and dunes and the important facilities and infrastructure sitting behind them are protected.

“All construction is timed with tidal and weather conditions and undertaken with the relevant environmental permits in place.

“At times, water surrounding the groynes may seem slightly discoloured due to sand disturbance. This is no cause for alarm and water quality monitoring will be in place.”

Stage 1 Maroochy Groyne Renewal sand-filled geotextile bags.

The adjacent Cotton Tree Holiday Park will remain open to guests and community access to the beach and river will be maintained with dedicated ‘safe zones’ throughout construction.

Works have been scheduled outside of peak holiday periods where possible to minimise disruption to locals and visitors and are scheduled to be completed in September.

To help progress the works as safely and quickly as possible a section of the Alexandra Parade beach car park will be temporarily closed for use by the construction contractor. The remainder of the car park will remain open for community use.

**FAST FACTS**

*   Stage 1 of the project was completed in August 2020 and included renewing the two northern-most groyne structures (Groynes #3 and #4) and part of the existing seawall
*   Stage 2 works include replacing the two remaining, southern-most groyne structures (Groynes #1 and #2) to further protect the foreshore.
