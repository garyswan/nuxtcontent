Volunteers across the Sunshine Coast are bucking national trends and staying active despite national numbers on the decline according to research by [Volunteering Australia](https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/research/research-briefing-the-experience-of-volunteers-during-covid-19/#/)
.

Once facilities opened after the COVID-19 lockdown, Sunshine Coast Council saw volunteer numbers and activity return to normal, with more than 2500 registered volunteers across council-managed volunteering programs.

This National Volunteer Week, 17–23 May 2021, Sunshine Coast Council has thanked volunteers for their unwavering dedication and time given to the common good. 

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law shared his gratitude for volunteers and said it’s thanks to the help of devoted volunteers that council was able to deliver many of its programs.

“Volunteers who willingly give their time, efforts and experience for nothing in return are the backbone of our community,” Cr Law said.

“People such as Karen Anderson, one of our incredible TurtleCare group leaders who was nominated for the Queensland Volunteering Awards, make an enormous contribution through leadership to future generations and passion for conservation.

“This year’s theme for National Volunteer Week is Recognise, Reconnect and Reimagine, and I believe it’s an important reminder that we must give thanks to our wonderful volunteers, take time to reconnect with what’s important, and then think of new ways that we can support our volunteers and greater communities.”

To help celebrate this special week, Sunshine Coast Council is proud to partner with Volunteering Sunshine Coast for the upcoming Volunteer of the Year Awards to be held on 29 May at University of the Sunshine Coast.

Cr Law said this event partnership was a wonderful opportunity to recognise and celebrate the many volunteers across the region, including many individuals who volunteered through council-led groups.

“Through council-managed facilities and activity groups, there are more than 2500 volunteers registered and giving back to special places like Bankfoot House and Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve or to activities like Libraries’ literacy programs and BushCare’s tree planting,” Cr Law said.

“At the beginning of the pandemic last year, it was a sad but necessary requirement to pause many volunteer programs.

“While it’s been a slow return for some groups, we are happy to see volunteer numbers returning to their pre-pandemic status.

“That being said, there are always opportunities to give back, be it through volunteering for special events or looking out for wildlife while out and about.

“For those interested in volunteering through council, I invite you to visit our libraries, environmental education centres or other facilities, check out our website or have a chat with any of the council officers who look after volunteer programs.”

Council has several ways to get involved and give back to the community through council-managed programs. To learn more, visit [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/volunteering](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/volunteering)
