Sunshine Coast Council crews and contractors have been busy clearing debris and assessing our roads in flood-affected areas to open them to through-traffic and make them safe again.

During the severe weather events our roads held up well, however some areas across the Sunshine Coast have had been significantly impacted, due to the downpours.

Sunshine Coast Council Roads Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said he welcomed the community’s assistance in locating any damaged roads and potholes that had emerged during the recent deluge.

“Landslips and falling trees can occur for weeks to come, so if you are on the roads, please be aware of that risk and always observe and follow any signage,” Cr Baberowski said.

“We always appreciate the community’s efforts in alerting us to any repairs needed, especially on local residential streets.

“So don’t hesitate to let us know if there is a pothole near you. The quicker our team knows about the job, the quicker it’s actioned and filled.”

You can lodge an [eRequest online](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Contact-Council/Request-for-Service-Online-Form)
&#x20;or contact council’s Customer Contact Centre on 5475 7272.

Narrows Rd, Montville - 27 Feb 2022

“Council maintains almost 3000km of local roads and bridges throughout the region,” Cr Baberowski said.  

“It’s council’s number one priority to keep our roads and users safe, so we have repair crews on the ground every day closely monitoring and maintaining emerging potholes.

“Please be mindful of road workers and hazard signs by slowing down to 40km/h to keep everyone safe.”

Sunshine Coast Council has a free online tool to help both residents and visitors better navigate local roads.
