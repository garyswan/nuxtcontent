Dawn Awakening, an uplifting multi-arts celebration of remembrance, dreaming and ritual, will rise again.

The traditional closing highlight of the popular Horizon Festival was recently postponed due to poor weather conditions.

Fortunately, it has been rescheduled and given a new date, Sunday, October 30. The free event will be held at Coolum’s Stumers Creek from 4.30am.

Horizon Festival Director Hannah Clissold encouraged fans to go to the [Horizon Festival](https://www.horizonfestival.com.au/event/dawn-awakening/)
&#x20;website to register and secure their spot.

“This is a great opportunity for you to see this much-loved Dawn Awakening ceremony and to see the official closing of Horizon Festival 2022,” Ms Clissold said.

“Visitors will gather along the banks of Stumers Creek in Coolum as the first light rises for this important First Nations Ceremony, led by the amazing Lyndon Davis.”

Locals and visitors are invited to take the journey together through the Dawn Awakening story, dance, song, visual art projections, spoken word and fire installations, to reflect, strengthen and testify a flourishing connection to country, culture and each other.

This signature event, creatively produced by Lyndon Davis from the Gubbi Gubbi Dance Troupe, features First Nations artists from the local region and guests from across the nation.

Previously the event was booked out prior to the cancellation. Register now to secure your spot.
