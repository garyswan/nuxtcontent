Dust off your keyboard or grab your pen and paper and celebrate Library Lovers Day (February 14) by registering for a writing workshop.

Library Lovers Day is all about celebrating libraries and the valuable role they play in our community.

This year the love will be shared throughout 2022 with a series of writing workshops hosted by Sunshine Coast Libraries, in partnership with the Queensland Writer’s Centre,

First up is the *Learn to Write Short, Sharp Stories Workshop* which will be held at the Coolum Civic Centre on Saturday, February 19 at 9.30am.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said it was the perfect opportunity to learn how to turn your short story idea into great fiction.

“If you’ve got a story idea, come along to this workshop where you’ll learn vital techniques and writing habits to help develop, draft and improve your work,” Cr Law said.

“You’ll benefit from the experience of presenter Eileen Herbert-Goodall, a widely published author and writing coach who teaches creative writing at the University of the Sunshine Coast.

“This fun, interactive three-hour writing workshop includes all the tips and tricks for delivering short, sharp stories.”

The workshop costs $25 per person, including coffee and tea, BYO morning snack and personal writing tools or device.

With limited spaces available, [registration](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Writing-Workshop)
&#x20;is essential.

In line with COVID-19 protocols, attendees must check in at the venue using the Check In Qld app and wear masks while inside the venue unless eating or drinking.

Cr Law said the Sunshine Coast was home to a 110,000 plus strong and engaged library community.

“Our libraries are much loved by the community. You might even say they’re great match-makers because they’ll always help you find a new favourite book or the information you’re looking for,” he said.

“If you haven’t already become a member, it’s free and easy and you can also join 70,000 other subscribers by signing up to receive the Libraries eNews direct to your inbox or follow Sunshine Coast Libraries on social media to be the first to hear about library programs, sessions and events.

“And don’t forget to download the Sunshine Coast Libraries App which allows you to access your account 24/7 to explore the catalogue, browse new releases, renew loans, reserve your favourite titles and much more.”

As part of Library Lovers Day, tap into a specially curated online program featuring all the latest and greatest love stories for members to reserve, watch and listen to, or collect from their local branch.
