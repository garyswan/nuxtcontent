That feeling of showing off your latest purchase is always a thrill – but does it always need to be brand new?

For many young shoppers the repurposed and circular fashion economy is often the best place to find treasures, unique pieces and establish their self-style.

Venue 114’s first ever Mega Youth Market will provide Sunshine Coast youth with an exciting opportunity to connect young sellers and buyers to preloved and handmade goods.

Community Portfolio Councillor Cr David Law said the Mega Youth Market provided an exciting and meaningful platform for young people to shop sustainably.

“The Mega Youth Market is the perfect place for our community’s young thrifters and entrepreneurs to make a positive impact and re-purpose as an alternative to fast fashion,” Cr Law said.

“We are excited to bring this event to Sunshine Coast youth providing a sustainable opportunity for our young community members to re-purpose their pre-loved items or showcase their handmade talents.

“The dedicated event is for 10 to 17-year-olds to come together with their peers in a safe space to connect, engage and exchange.

“Recognised through the [EarthCheck Evaluate](https://venue114.com.au/hire/sustainability/)
&#x20;program, Venue 114 is a socially responsible, clean and green venue, and the perfect place to host this sustainable and youth focused event.”

Event entry is free and stalls are available to book now for only $10 per stall plus booking fee. Hurry, there are limited stalls available, and they will sell out!

Parent/guardian permission is required to book a stall with details and terms and conditions available on the event [website](https://venue114.com.au/events/mega-youth-market/)
