The comforting space of the Maroochydore Library provides a welcoming environment to the Sunshine Coast Writers' Roundtable (SCWRT), a casual and supportive community of serious writers.

The group was founded by Ali Stegert when she had recently moved to the region and was eager to connect with local like-minded people.

Ms Stegert said she was familiar with the challenges of solo writing and was looking for a local group of writers going through a shared experience.

“I wanted to make new friends and meet people who understood the unique challenges of getting published and growing as a writer,” Ms Stegert said.

"We love using the library space to meet. We originally tried meeting in cafes and homes, but we ended up chatting the whole time and getting no writing done. The library atmosphere is conducive to writing, and of course we're all library lovers."

The friendly, supportive network aims to reduce some of the inherent isolation of writing with aspiring and published authors. SCWRT writers create children's books, women's fiction, self-help, poetry, and nonfiction.

Sunshine Coast Writers’ Roundtable meet on Mondays from 9:30am to 11am at the Maroochydore library for individual writing time. Afterwards, they walk to a nearby cafe for coffee and shoptalk.

The members share weekly goals, celebrate breakthroughs, commiserate over rejections, and encourage one another.
