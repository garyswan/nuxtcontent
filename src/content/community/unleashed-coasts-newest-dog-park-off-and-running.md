From wagging tails to lolling tongues and happy barks – Mapleton’s furry friends, were eager to sniff out the region’s newest dog area at Lilly Ponds Park.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was pleased to work with the community and their pooches to deliver a new dog off leash area close to town.

“The new fenced site offers the community a good overall layout to enjoy time outdoors with their furry companion in a well-located area away from other park users,” Cr Law said.

“The space is easily accessible for all our community members, with ramps and rails. It’s also close to car parking while being far enough away from the main road and traffic to give our dog owners ease of mind.

“Council’s records show there is one dog registered for every seven people and that’s why there was a strong need for a dog off-leash facility in the local area – considering the nearest unfenced dog off-leash area is Petrie Park, Nambour and the nearest fenced facility is at Federation Park, Palmwoods.

“I would like to thank long-time Mapleton local and advocate for the project, Hank Cedric Wade, who championed this project, as well as the many community members who provided feedback last year to help determine their favoured site.”

Mapleton Dog off-leash area.

Following community feedback in 2019, the community identified three potential locations for a dog off leash area.

In March 2021, council sought further feedback to determine the preferred location being Mapleton Lilyponds Park.

Mr Hank Cedric Wade and 9yo Weimaraner named Ferro.

Mr Wade said he was pleased to see the gates open to a community project which had been years in the making.

“My nine-year-old Weimaraner named Ferro is the reason I was so eager to get a dog park in Mapleton,” Mr Wade said.

“He’s desperate to socialise with other dogs and there were no places to do so safely.

“Ferro and I walk through Mapleton Lilyponds Park daily, sometimes twice a day, and it was a proud moment for us to be the first to walk through the gates and let Ferro sniff and run around in the new facility.

“I rallied 100 or so dog owners to show the need for a dedicated dog area.  

“I would like to thank Cr Law very much for listening to our feedback. Council has done a terrific job on the new area and making it accessible for all.

“I would also like to thank our team members Claire Torkington, Larissa Phillips, and the late Victoria Simon for their help and support in getting this project started.”
