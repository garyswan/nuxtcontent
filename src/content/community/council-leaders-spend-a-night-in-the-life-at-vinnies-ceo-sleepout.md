Sunshine Coast Council representatives united with other leaders across the country at last night’s Vinnies CEO Sleepout to help raise funds for homelessness services and shine a light on breaking the cycle of homelessness.

CEO Emma Thomas, Councillor Maria Suarez and Group Executives Greg Laverty, Debra Robinson and Scott Taylor experienced a cold winter’s night in the life of our most vulnerable on Thursday, June 22.

Sunshine Coast Council CEO Emma Thomas said over the last few years we had all become more aware of our increasing number of local residents and Australians experiencing tough times and at risk of finding themselves without a safe place to call home.   

“This is the second time I’ve participated in this event, which is growing with more and more support each year,” Ms Thomas said.

### “Whilst we will experience one night, we are mindful of people who face uncertainty more often.”

“Council is also preparing a Housing and Homelessness Action Plan, which will outline actions to help address housing and homelessness on the Sunshine Coast. 

“Our Sunshine Coast Council Sleepout Team raised more than $9360 and joined business, government and community leaders across Australia in sleeping out outdoors to support the many Australians who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness. 

“All funds raised will help Vinnies’ vital services stay up-and-running all year round. This includes food, accommodation, education, counselling, employment and health programs for our residents who are impacted by homelessness.”

### ​​All money raised will go to the St Vincent de Paul Society to support impacted Australians. ​
