On the final countdown to the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games (24 August), Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson has wished our local Para-athletes every success on their quest to glory.

Ten Sunshine Coast Para-athletes join 169 others from across the country to make up the largest Australian Paralympic team to ever contest a Games overseas.

Mayor Jamieson said he couldn’t wait for the Paralympics to begin.

“We have an inspiring group of Sunshine Coast Para-athletes – six men and four women ranging from swimming to wheelchair rugby, wheelchair basketball and athletics,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I couldn’t be prouder of these talented individuals who will loudly, proudly and fiercely represent our Sunshine Coast and Australia.

“If the Tokyo Olympics were anything to go by, the Tokyo Paralympics will be extraordinary and I encourage our entire Sunshine Coast community to rally together and show their support.

“It terrific to see that despite to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Paralympic Games are still able to go ahead.

“I have no doubt the efforts of our Para-athletes will inspire and motivate many more in our community and future generations.

“Para-athletes will be crucial to the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, with the Sunshine Coast proposed to host multiple days of road-based events (marathon and road cycling) during those Games.”

**FAST FACTS**

Our Sunshine Coast Para-athletes are:

*   Daniel Bounty (athletics)
*   Hannah Dodd (wheelchair basketball)
*   Chris Bond (wheelchair rugby)
*   Blake Cochrane, Katja Dedekind, Benjamin Hance (pictured), Braedan Jason, Liam Schluter, Keira Stephens and Ruby Storm (swimming).

Australia will compete in 18 of the 22 sports on the program for Tokyo, including debut Paralympic sports Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton.
