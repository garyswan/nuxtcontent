They provide an easy and environmentally friendly way out of traffic jams and their use is surging throughout the world.

Now Sunshine Coast Council, which is working towards creating the most sustainable region in the nation, wants to explore whether electric scooters and bikes could make life here even better.

Council will seek expressions of interest for an e-scooter and e-bike operator trial in the Maroochydore and Mooloolaba area.

The announcement is set to garner interest from new and existing hire operators keen to roll out their service in the region.

It is understood that a combination of tourists and locals would embrace the opportunity.

Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said the trial was an exciting step towards more sustainable travel solutions for the region.

“This trial is an opportunity for council, residents and visitors to test e-scooter and e-bike hire operators on the Sunshine Coast.

“E-scooters and e-bikes are a sustainable travel option that ease traffic congestion and provide an active and eco-friendly alternative to getting around.

“The trial is another step towards the Sunshine Coast Council’s goal of becoming Australia’s most sustainable region.”
