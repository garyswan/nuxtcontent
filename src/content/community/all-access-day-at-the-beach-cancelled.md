Due to the wet weather received and forecast for tomorrow, Friday December 2, the Sunshine Coast All Access Day at the Beach event has sadly been cancelled.

The community event was to be part of International Day of People with Disability celebrations.

Council apologies for any inconvenience caused, but safety is paramount. Council thanks the community for their understanding.
