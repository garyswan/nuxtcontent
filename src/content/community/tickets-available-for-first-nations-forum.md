First Nations voices will come together at the 2nd First Nations Self-Determination, Representation and Wellbeing Forum at the Novotel Twin Waters on Monday, August 8 and Tuesday, August 9.

The forum will celebrate International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples on August 9.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the forum was a great opportunity for First Nations communities to join together for collaborative discussions about voice, self-determination and wellbeing.

“The First Nations Self-Determination, Representation and Wellbeing Forum was a great success last year with more than 250 people attending and I look forward to seeing the outcomes of the 2022 forum,” Cr Law said.

“Council is committed to growing a strong community including long term and meaningful engagement with Traditional Custodians and First Nations communities as per the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
, [Sunshine Coast Reconciliation Action Plan](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Council-Plans/Sunshine-Coast-Reconciliation-Action-Plan)
&#x20;and our [Corporate Plan 2022-2026](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Experience-Sunshine-Coast/Healthy-Smart-Creative/Our-Vision)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Senior First Nations Advisor Stephen Mam said he was pleased to see the forum return for a second year.

“The forum is a key opportunity to unite First Nations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) people in our region and provides an update on where things are at, explores best practice, case studies and gives community the tools to grow using a strengths-based approach,” Mr Mam said.

“The 2022 First Nations Forum is about coming together, nurturing relationships and action.

“Key themes include cultural integrity, cultural values and practices, First Nations story, empowerment, representation and economic development.

“The event will also feature community delegation workshops around social connections and community values, justice and recidivism, health and wellbeing, housing, industry and business, cultural tourism and environmental management.

“I encourage First Nations community members to secure their tickets and come along.

“This event is driven by First Nations people calling for a participatory voice, greater representation and the right to be self-determining - recognising that our aspirations are bound to the wellbeing of individuals, families, community and Country.”
