What happens when Shane Jacobson, Fiona O’Loughlin, Michala Banas and Dave O’Neill get together with some of Australia’s best bands and musical talent? We’re not quite sure, but we know it will be hilarious and a lot of fun!

More than 20 of Australia’s biggest names in comedy and music will feature at a three-day festival of laughter, tunes and food on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast later this year.

‘That’s Not My Dog – The Festival’ will take place from Friday 26 August to Sunday 28 August 2022 at King’s Beach Amphitheatre, Caloundra.

Australian entertainment legend Shane Jacobson, whose movie ‘That’s Not My Dog’ inspired the festival, leads a stellar line-up of comedians and musical artists in three days hilarious storytelling, fantastic food and Aussie music.

In the movie ‘That’s Not My Dog’, Jacobson gathered the cream of Australia’s comedy and entertainment community on a country property with hilarious results. The festival draws on this concept, bringing together the biggest and most loved names in comedy for a weekend of hilarity and amazing music.

The festival precinct areas at King’s Beach Amphitheatre will include a main stage, food and bar space, comedy and open mike space, local musicians and large screens.

Shane Jacobson says ‘That’s Not My Dog – The Festival’ is unlike any other festival in Australia.

“We are thrilled to be staging Australia’s funniest festival on the Sunshine Coast in August 2022,” said Jacobson.

“That’s Not My Dog! The Festival will get Australians laughing again as we combine hilarious joke and story-telling with brilliant music and amazing local food, beer and wine.

“A big thank you to the Sunshine Coast Council for supporting this unique event which will attract people from all over Australia to Queensland for a long weekend of laughter, fun and relaxation.”

Sunshine Coast Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said comedy plus live music was a winning formula, sure to attract plenty to Caloundra, our city of beaches in August.

“This three-day weekend event will be popular for locals and visitors alike because Winter is such a great time of year to enjoy our fabulous beaches, hinterland experiences and outdoor events,” Cr O’Pray said.

“Sunshine Coast Airport has regular flights in and out of the Sunshine Coast that could connect Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne comedy festival lovers to the coast for a really fun trip to escape the cold.”

‘That’s Not My Dog – The Festival’ tickets start at $66.00 per day, with three-day packages, concession and student tickets available - book your tickets and find out more at [www.thatsnotmydogfestival.com.au](http://www.thatsnotmydogfestival.com.au)
