A hidden bushland oasis, just minutes from one of the Sunshine Coast’s favourite coastal lookouts, has received a new elevated boardwalk just in time for the holidays.

Nestled among lush rainforest behind Point Arkwright, the rejuvenated boardwalk is located at Yaroomba Bushland Park.

It is not only more accessible and storm resistant, it is also made entirely from more sustainable products such as fibre composite materials and recycled plastic elements.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said the 152-metre boardwalk was a wonderfully easy way for our community to get active and immerse themselves in nature.

“The Yaroomba Bushland Park is a very special place for our community,” Cr O’Pray said.

“It’s much-loved for its picturesque walks, abundant wetland, vine forest, Wallum woodlands, shaded picnic areas and quiet children’s playground.

“The new boardwalk replaced the aged wooden walkway off Neurum Road with a careful construction approach to ensure zero harm to vegetation and wildlife.

“It now offers a safer and more durable asset for our community to explore this magic pocket of parkland.

“The boardwalk connects to a one-kilometre walking and cycling circuit that’s perfect for people of all ages to enjoy.”

The $300,000 Yaroomba Bushland Park boardwalk project was fully funded by Sunshine Coast Council’s Minor Capital Works Program after receiving support and nomination by Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray.

Council thanks residents for their patience and understanding as this community facility was updated.
