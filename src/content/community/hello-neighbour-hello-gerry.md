Help create belonging across the Sunshine Coast and build the inclusive community you want to live in, one relationship at a time.

Neighbour Day is the annual day of action for Neighbours Every Day – celebrated on the last Sunday of March (26 March).

Neighbourhood connections support belonging and wellbeing, and assists communities to become stronger.

Sunshine Coast Council has a ‘At Home in my Neighbourhood’ toolkit to help you connect with your neighbours!

[You can download it here](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/living-and-community/community-support/at-home-in-my-neighbourhood)


### 10 great reasons to connect with your neighbours:

1.  To have fun and celebrate
2.  To hear new and interesting stories
3.  To share knowledge, skills and resources
4.  To learn about your neighbourhood history or create the history!
5.  To recognise your neighbours and learn a little about each other
6.  To create a neighbourhood that’s inclusive and safe
7.  To collaborate and take action for the benefit of the neighbourhood
8.  To know who might need a little extra help
9.  To create a sense of belonging – a place where you feel at home
10. To welcome new people into the neighbourhood

Neighbourhood gatherings are an opportunity to build friendships, have fun, share ideas or work together on a common activity, whilst developing a sense of belonging among residents.

Neighbour Day is a call-to-action day for Relationships Australia’s Neighbours Every Day social connection campaign. It aims to support and enable sustainable respectful relationships across communities, while also helping to address loneliness.

The theme for 2023 is ‘Create Belonging’, inviting everyone in Australia to take everyday actions that create social connection and foster respectful relationships.

[For more information on Neighbour Day click here](https://neighbourseveryday.org/)


Every connection helps create belonging and Neighbour Day is a day we can stop and think of ways we can connect through simple act of friendship.

You could simply have a chat with a new or old neighbour over a cuppa, host a neighbourhood BBQ or meet up for a game of soccer at the local oval.

Create the community you want to live in today!
