Does your community organisation need funding to help with one-off projects, events and activities? 

Make it a reality with support from Sunshine Coast Council’s Community Grants Program. 

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said not-for-profit groups could apply for a Minor Grant of up to $2000 for projects that align with council’s strategic priorities and demonstrate a community purpose.

“The program aims to acknowledge the incredible contribution our Sunshine Coast community groups and their volunteers make to achieving our shared vision of being Australia’s most sustainable region: Healthy. Smart. Creative,” Cr Law said.

“This is an opportunity for community groups to apply for funding for community led responses to identified community needs.

“Applications are now open and close on October 31, 2022.”

The Kenilworth Arts Council was awarded a Minor Grant in the previous round to host an art exhibition featuring artworks by local Sunshine Coast artists.

The funding supported the community organisation with directional signage to increase the event’s visibility.

Kenilworth Arts Council Secretary Annie Ryan said they had more than 400 visitors enjoy the art exhibition held in July this year, which showcased local artists.

“We sincerely thank council for the grant which enabled the addition of bright, clear signage to help direct visitors to the Kenilworth Hall,” Ms Ryan said.

“Thirty volunteers were involved in this project and it was a wonderful feast of art works for Kenilworth locals and visitors.

“I would encourage other community groups to apply for assistance for their next event, project or activity.”

Minor Grant applications can be submitted in one of six categories: 

*   Community Development
*   Community Facilities
*   Creative Development
*   Cultural Heritage
*   Economic Development
*   Sport and Recreation.
