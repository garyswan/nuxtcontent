The Sunshine Coast community has united as one to mark Domestic and Family Violence Prevention Month (May) with a candle-lighting vigil held at Cotton Tree Park.

More than 250 people gathered at the Centacare and Council hosted event last night (May 4).  The annual event has been held by Centacare since 2000.

The vigil and march’s theme was *[Hear Her Voice](https://www.womenstaskforce.qld.gov.au/about-us/news/news-items/hear-her-voice-queenslands-women-heard-loud-and-clear-in-taskforces-first-report)
*, which asked the community to hear the voices, stories and perspectives of women and children experiencing violence.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said there was more we could all do, as individuals and as a community, to show those who are suffering they are not alone.

“The march and candle-lighting were a sobering reminder that domestic and family violence continues to affect the Sunshine Coast community like it does every other,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“I hope that anyone affected by domestic or family violence can gain strength from the support of our community tonight.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was proud to see the number of people who have united against domestic and family violence.

“I would like to thank the community who attended the event to take a stand against abuse,” Cr Law said.

“I also extend my gratitude to Centacare and all event partners for their continued coordination of the event and their daily hard work in supporting survivors of domestic and family violence.

“Council is committed to continuing to support the drive to end gendered violence and it is a key goal of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;to address domestic violence within our community.”
