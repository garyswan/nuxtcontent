Sunshine Coast Libraries is about to introduce a new mobile library timetable to better reflect community demand and patterns of use.

The new schedule, effective from May 30, will change for some current stops and new stops will be introduced to respond to more people choosing to live on the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the new timetable would provide a more flexible, targeted service that met community demand for Library services.

“Council works with the community every day to ensure we continue to provide great services,” said Cr Law. 

“More people are choosing to move to the Sunshine Coast and, to ensure everyone has access to a library, council reviewed our mobile library service.

“We found some mobile library stops were under-utilised with borrowing habits changing over time.

“As a result of the review, three stops have been updated with new times and days – Meridan Plains, Palmwoods and Peregian Springs - and the Glasshouse Mountains stop will no longer be included in the mobile library stops. 

“Beerwah Library is located within five kilometres of the previous Glasshouse Mountains Mobile Library stop and is open six days a week with a click-and-collect service available to all members.

“The new timetable ensures more equitable access to library services across the region.”

For customers unable to access alternative libraries, there are also other ways to access library services.

Library staff are happy to discuss alternative options with customers affected by these changes.

These may include the [Home Library service](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Services/Home-Library-Service)
&#x20;which is available for borrowers who are unable to visit their local library due to illness, disability or limited mobility and have no one who can visit the library on their behalf.

Borrowers are connected with a volunteer who chooses, delivers and returns books and other library items based on the borrower’s preferences. 

Borrowers can also use the  [Council Link service](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Roads-and-Transport/Transport-options/Public-Transport/Council-Link)
, an affordable transport service available for people aged 60 and over, people with a disability or mobility impairment (DSP concession card holders), carers and minors accompanying eligible people (carer’s card or companion card holders).

The new Mobile Library [timetable](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Visit/Mobile-Libraries/Mobile-Timetable)
&#x20;will begin on Monday May 30.
