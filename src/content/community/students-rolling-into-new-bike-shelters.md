Three Sunshine Coast primary schools celebrated National Ride2School Day today (March 25) by storing their bikes, scooters and skateboards in their brand new bike cage facilities.

Sunshine Coast Council, in partnership with the Transport and Main Roads - School Transport Infrastructure Program (STIP) and the Department of Education, has installed bike cages for secure and weatherproof storage at Chancellor State College, Caloundra State School and Buddina State School.

Mayor Mark Jamieson said the new shelters would improve safety and connectivity around those central schools.

“By encouraging more students to ride, scoot or skate to school, we are helping reduce traffic congestion,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“These partnerships and initiatives will help make a difference to many and also reinforce council’s vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region, healthy, smart and creative.

“The new facilities will further encourage young people to maintain or develop healthy and sustainable transport habits.”

Sunshine Coast Council Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said he was pleased to officially open the new facilities at Chancellor State College.

“I’m very pleased to see so many Sunshine Coast students embrace this initiative and hope it encourages even more in the community to join the movement,” Cr Baberowski said.

Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the Palaszczuk Government’s School Transport Infrastructure Program was delivering $20 million to support schools across Queensland.

“I believe it’s important to get kids on bikes, encouraging them to stay fit and healthy,” Mr Hunt said.

“We want to see more kids riding bikes to school right across the Sunshine Coast.

“On average, every $1 invested in cycling infrastructure returns almost $5 to Queenslanders in health benefits, reduced traffic congestion, and other benefits.

“To encourage this, we’re building the infrastructure that is needed by the school and Caloundra community as a priority.”

Chancellor State College Primary Campus Principal Mr Mark Birchall said the new facility would help secure student pushbikes and importantly improve the safety of students moving through the area.

The bike cage recipients were identified through Sunshine Coast Council’s [RideScore Active Schools Program](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Living-and-Community/Roads-and-Transport/Transport-options/Active-School-Travel/Programs-and-events/RideScore-Active-Schools)
. The program uses technology to direct-message parents when their children have arrived safely at school.

As well as Chancellor State Collage, Caloundra State School and Buddina State School, the program was recently rolled out to Baringa State Primary School, Bli Bli State School, Brightwater State School, Coolum State School, Meridan State College and Peregian Springs State School.
