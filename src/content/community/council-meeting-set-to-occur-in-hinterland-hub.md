Sunshine Coast Council’s Ordinary Meeting next week (July 28) will take place at the Nambour Council chambers in the Eddie De Vere Building on Currie Street.

It follows the Queensland Government’s cabinet meeting being held in Nambour earlier this week (July 18).

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see the Ordinary Meeting take place at the building named after former councillor [Eddie De Vere](https://heritage.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Stories/Identities/Eddie-De-Vere)
.

“We have been conducting our council meetings in Caloundra since the pandemic due to the chamber having a larger capacity to allow for social distancing,” Cr Law said.

“As such, this will be the first time our current council will meet in Nambour since the local government election on March 28, 2020.

“I’m pleased we can meet in Nambour next week; it will be live streamed as per usual for the community to minimise in person attendance to keep everyone safe.

“It’s timely after having the Premier and Cabinet conduct their meeting here in Nambour on Monday – it shows how our hinterland hub is a place for business and is becoming a draw card for private investment and new homeowners.

“Council recognises the importance of Nambour as one of the region’s key service centres and the work being done by recently appointed Wilson Architects will help to ensure our future utilisation of our key council buildings is in the best interests of the Nambour and Hinterland communities.

“Wilson Architects are currently leading the preliminary design and feasibility study for Council owned buildings in Nambour.

“We anticipate that we will see refurbishments including a district level library, community meeting spaces and improvements to the Customer contact centre, which will complement planned streetscape upgrades and Nambour’s emerging performance scene within the Special Entertainment Precinct.

“More than 200 council staff will continue to work in Nambour as part of council’s broader regional Workplaces program.

“With this in mind, the future of our assets – like the Eddie De Vere Building – are an important priority for our Council.

“I’m also pleased that my fellow councillors will be in Nambour to discuss and consider a report on Zero Net Emissions – a project and direction that I’ve been very passionate about.”
