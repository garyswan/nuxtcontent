Sunshine Coast residents and visitors have favoured a new separated cycle track with a side of on-street parking.

The outcome will add to almost six kilometres of bike lanes and pathways between Sippy Downs, Buderim, and Mountain Creek.

The retention of on-street parking was a key theme revealed through recent community engagement for the [Karawatha Drive Cycle Track](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Infrastructure-Projects/Karawatha-Drive-Cycle-Track)
&#x20;project in Mountain Creek, which included an online survey via council’s ‘Have your say’ [webpage](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/karawatha-drive-mountain-creek-one-way-cycle-tracks)
.

The project will deliver a 2-metre-wide cycle track adjacent to the footpath and will be separated from traffic lanes and parking bays, plus a dedicated kerbside parking corridor also separated from traffic lanes. All bus stops along the route will be retained with intersection improvements made.

The new walking and cycling network promises to deliver a low stress route for all Karawatha Drive users (pedestrians, cyclists and motorists), linking communities within our growing Sunshine Coast region.

Community's preferred option for the cycle track, Option 2 (indicative only).

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said the engagement provided a clear vision for the new separated cycle track and he thanked the community for their input.

“The community’s preferred option was to retain kerbside parking along Karawatha Drive”, Cr Dickson said.

“Improved shade coverage with new landscaping, and offset planting will also be incorporated as part of project.

“Council has been providing new cycle facilities across the coast to improve access and increase pedestrian and cycle safety.

“Cyclists riding along Karawatha Drive currently share the road shoulder and traffic lanes with motor vehicles, or the footpath with pedestrians.

“The new 1.6-kilometre-long separated cycle track will significantly improve riding confidence, and safety for all users.

“The project will also provide an enhanced travel route to nearby destinations such as schools, TAFE, businesses and Mooloolaba.

“I really appreciate the clear direction the community has provided, and I look forward to seeing the project progress.”

Council asked our community to consider three different design options for the new Karawatha Cycle Track. Retaining car parking received the most support (48%), followed by Option 1 - retaining vegetation (29%), and Option 3 – a compromise between parking and vegetation (23%).

Sunshine Coast Council Deputy Mayor and Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said council would now undertake detailed design of the preferred option for the cycle track project and expected to begin construction in late 2023.

“Improving our active transport routes across the Sunshine Coast is a high priority for council,” Cr Baberowski said.

“Walking and cycling plays an increasingly important transport role – now and certainly more so into the future.

“Active transport routes such as these will help deliver further mobility options, safer streets, healthier residents, and reduce the impact on our precious environment.”
