Nominations are now open for a Sunshine Coast Council Community Reference Group (CRG) to contribute to the development of a master plan for the Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park area.

Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the reference group would provide a forum for the community to provide input into the future planning and management of this coastal area which would include an analysis of the site, current uses, understanding environmental opportunities and constraints, values and vision, ecological sustainability and proposed actions, priorities, and costs to be considered for implementation.

“To do this, we need to speak with the community and listen to their views and needs so we can ensure a safe, shared space and preserve our natural environment for years to come,” Cr Natoli said.

“We’re at an early pre-planning phase and we want to gain a more detailed and a factual understanding about how the area is being used.

“It’s really no surprise how increasingly popular this area is within Division 4, with the headland providing a great recreation area and sweeping views from Mooloolaba to Coolum.”

The group will play a vital role in connecting with the local community, shaping community engagement, sharing project information and, importantly, providing an insight into the challenges and opportunities within the area.

The Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park master planning process will allow council to gain a more detailed and factual understanding about how the picturesque area is being used by the community and once finalised, will guide future use, management, and infrastructure investment.

It's very important we get input from a diverse range of community voices - Cr Cox.

Environment and Liveability portfolio Cr Cox said establishing a CRG was an important component of the project’s community engagement and participation process.

“It’s very important we get input from a diverse range of community voices and ensure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard,” Cr Cox said.

“Anyone who loves this beautiful corner of the Sunshine Coast – locals, residents, business owners, people with environmental interests, young people, people who love walking their dog or exercising in the area – we want to hear from you, so please send your expression of interest to council.”

Forming a CRG is a tried and tested approach - Cr Natoli

The CRG is just one of the ways interested community members will be able to get involved in the project and council will progressively keep the community informed on engagement activities as the project progresses.

The CRG will consist of an independent chair, up to 10 community members, and councillor representation. Members are expected to attend four meetings with their role equating to approximately two to six hours per month.

“Forming a CRG is a tried and tested approach – as we have seen with our Biosphere nomination and the development of the Coastal Hazard Adaptation Strategy,” Cr Cox said.

“Council anticipates significant outcomes can be realised through this collaborative initiative.”
