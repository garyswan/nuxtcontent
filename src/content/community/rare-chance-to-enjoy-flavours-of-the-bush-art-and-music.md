You’re invited to an afternoon of food, market stalls and entertainment featuring First Nations Suppliers.

This year, Sunshine Coast Council will hold its First Nations Supplier Day at Nambour on October 10 in a market-style format where residents, suppliers and businesses can all attend to see what is on offer.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the day established a platform to showcase local First Nations businesses and their ongoing contributions to the economic sustainability of the Sunshine Coast region.

“First Nations peoples were the first builders and engineers, the first inventors and scientists, the first agriculturalists and environmentalists, the first healers, and the first navigators and astronomers,” Cr Law said.

“Come along to discover local First Nations suppliers on the Sunshine Coast.

“Why not come and try some gin from Beachtree Distilling Co. or sample classic Aussie farmhouse preserves and condiments with traditional native flavours of the Australia bush by Figjam & Co.

“Browse art and merchandise by local Aboriginal artists at the Goorie Arts stall and enjoy entertainment from Deline Briscoe, Adam James, Lydia Fairhall, Getano Bann and Daddy Frank.

“The whole community is invited to come along to the Nambour Showgrounds on Monday, October 10 from 3pm to enjoy an afternoon of entertainment, food and market stalls!

“You will learn about the products and services available for your business and chat directly with First Nations suppliers.

“Sunshine Coast First Nations Supplier Day aims to support a strong and resilient community which prioritises local First Nations businesses.”

Council received a regional grant of $7500 from the Queensland Government to host the event during Indigenous Business Month.

Minister for Employment and Small Business Di Farmer said the government was committed to supporting the growth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and creating pathways to inspire the next generation of First Nations business leaders.

“Indigenous Business Month provides us with the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the wonderful contributions First Nations’ businesses make to our state and economy, but it also provides us with avenues to connect and collaborate so businesses can explore opportunities for growth and innovation,” Minister Farmer said.

“Currently there are more than 800 Indigenous businesses registered in Queensland on the Black Business Finder – ranging from community care to construction companies – and I thank Council for bringing local businesses together to boost their businesses and the local economy.”
