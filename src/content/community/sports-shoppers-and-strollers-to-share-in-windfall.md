More off-road parking, a new pedestrian and cyclist bridge, improvements to shared pathways and major boost for sporting clubs are among highlights for Division 7 in the Sunshine Coast Council 2023-24 Budget.

This division takes in the suburbs of Buderim, Diddilibah, Forest Glen, Kiels Mountain, Kuluin, Kunda Park, Maroochydore, Mons, Rousemount and Tanawha.

Division 7 Councillor Ted Hungerford said Council’s billion-dollar budget included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better and more sustainable Sunshine Coast.

“Council will invest $650,000 in upgrades to lighting at the Maroochydore Multi Sports Complex and sports field lighting at this highly popular facility,” Cr Hungerford said.    

“In keeping with Council’s strong commitment to our environment and sustainability, the renewal of existing field lighting will involve energy-efficient LED lights and fittings.

“A development plan for this facility will also be undertaken thanks to a $297,000 fully funded State Government grant under the Community Recreational Assets Recovery Resilience Program.

“Another $2.31 million will start construction of a new pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Sunshine Motorway on Stringybark Road, Sippy Downs, courtesy of a grant through the State Government’s Cycle Network Program.

“There is a $220,000 allocation for off road carparking on Main Street, Buderim and a $200,000 investment to design shoulder widening on Petrie Creek Road from Paynters Creek Road to Celestine Place in Rosemount.

“The budget includes $320,000 for stormwater rehabilitation works on Martins Creek Road in Buderim and $250,000 for upgrades to internal roads and parking facilities at the Ballinger Park Sports Complex.

“The Maroochydore Junior Rugby League Club will also undergo significant upgrades to its field lighting through a $225,000 budget allocation.”

Cr Hungerford said a number of parks and gardens projects within Division 7 were also included in this year’s budget.

“Deloraine Drive Park in Buderim will undergo playground and fencing renewal works; tables and seating renewal works will be carried out in Buderim Forest Park; and a community ping pong table will be installed in Buderim Village Park,” he said.

“Council purchased this 3.4ha piece of land in 2010 to develop it into an open, green, district level park. Buderim Village Park has become enormously popular with the local community and visitors to our region. 

“The fig tree signage in Wirreanda Park, Buderim will be renewed, new softfall will be installed at the playground in Lions Lookout Park in Buderim and John Atkinson Memorial Park seating will be renewed along with the name signage in Battalion Park, Buderim.

“I’m also very pleased to see the State Government’s Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements  provide funds for important landslide repair works at the Buderim Tramway trail in Mons and for landslip works at Tanawha Tourist Drive in Tanawha.

Council handed down its 2023-24 Budget on June 22.
