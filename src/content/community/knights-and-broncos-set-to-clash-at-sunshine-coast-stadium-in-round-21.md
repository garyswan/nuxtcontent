Sunshine Coast Stadium will host a Thursday night blockbuster between the Newcastle Knights and Brisbane Broncos on Thursday 5 August 2021 with gates opening at 6.15pm and kick-off at 7.50pm.

This fixture represents the first time the Broncos have played a regular season game on the Sunshine Coast. Great news for many supporters in our Sunshine Coast region who are expected to take this opportunity to attend a Broncos game in their own backyard.

This is the fifth game that the Sunshine Coast Stadium has hosted in the 2021 NRL season.

Stadium management is in conversations with the NRL regarding future fixtures for this season due to the COVID-19 pandemic and challenges this presents.

Tickets for the Knights v Broncos match go on sale 9am, Thursday 29 July 2021 through ticketek.com.au. Ticket prices range from $15 - $75 and family packages are available from $60.

The stadium configuration will include designated seating in the grandstand, bench seats in the try zones and general admission (including premium GA) will be seating on the grass mounds with picnic rugs and cushions permitted but no chairs allowed.

Corporate hospitality is available by emailing Sunshine Coast Stadium,  scstadium\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au.

The event complies with Queensland Health’s current COVID Safe Event checklist. The community is reminded to stay COVID alert and stay at home if unwell.

Everyone is also reminded they must sign-in using the Queensland Government QR code and follow Queensland Health directions.
