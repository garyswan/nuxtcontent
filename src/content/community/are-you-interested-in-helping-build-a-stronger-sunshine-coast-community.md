Expressions of Interest are now open for passionate and community-driven leaders to join the innovative Community Strategy Leadership Group (CSLG).

An initiative of Sunshine Coast Council, the CSLG is looking for passionate and connected community leaders that reflect our Sunshine Coast community, including active community members, representatives of government, community groups, organisations, agencies and service providers who are focused on social and community services for our region.  

Founded in 2020, the CSLG brings together key stakeholders committed to contributing to a thriving community, to lead and guide the delivery of council’s Sunshine Coast [Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.

Involvement in the group offers an opportunity for collective leadership and action to deliver and advocate for positive community outcomes on social issues and opportunities for the Sunshine Coast. The current membership of the CSLG will come to the end of its term in June 2022.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was really impressed with the work of the group and the actions completed and the outcomes achieved by the first CSLG members.

“The key goal of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;is to grow a strong community on the Sunshine Coast and the CSLG works to bring this vision to life,” Cr Law said.

“Council and the CSLG work closely to engage other levels of government, community and business organisations and provide expert advice and action to support the strategy’s priorities.

“As our community continues to grow, it is vital that we draw on our community partnerships and collective, collaborative potential, so the Sunshine Coast remains a connected, inclusive and cohesive place for all.

“The CSLG is a great opportunity to shape the future of our region and I encourage our community leaders to express their interest in the new group membership.”

CSLG member and USC’s Thompson Institute Manager, Strategic Partnerships Mervat Quirke said she found being part of the CSLG to be very rewarding.

“Being part of the leadership group provided me an opportunity to collaborate with other passionate people and contribute solutions to social issues that we could not have coordinated individually,” Ms Quirke said.

“The meetings are very professionally facilitated. They have a clear agenda and provide a safe space to connect to other members.

“Through the support of council, we have been able to bring our skillsets together, communicating authentically with heart and action combined.

“We coordinated various activities that were addressing challenges our communities were facing. As a group we collectively advocated and facilitated funding and services to launch a youth housing project in Nambour.”

Nominations close at 5pm on April 15, 2022.
