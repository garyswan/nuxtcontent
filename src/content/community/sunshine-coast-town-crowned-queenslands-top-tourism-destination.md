The state’s best holiday hotspots and local treasures have been revealed at the 2023 Queensland Top Tourism Town Awards Ceremony in Brisbane, with **Caloundra**, Airlie Beach, and Winton claiming top honours.

Presented by the Queensland Tourism Industry Council (QTIC), the annual Top Tourism Town Awards celebrate regional communities that demonstrate a commitment to visitor excellence.

After an extensive judging process and public voting campaign, the coastal escape of Caloundra was named the 2023 Queensland Top Tourism Town.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 2 Councillor Terry Landsberg said this was a wonderful achievement for everyone involved.

“Positivity and business confidence breeds success and I congratulate the Caloundra Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Caloundra Taskforce for their efforts in showcasing our unique destination,” Cr Landsberg said.

“It is great to see our family friendly Caloundra in the spotlight and receive the recognition it deserves.

“Caloundra Music Festival was recently named Festival of the Year at the Qld Music Awards, and now this tourism accolade reflects on all the things that make our town shine for visitors and locals alike.”

Queensland Tourism Industry Council CEO Brett Fraser congratulated Caloundra, Airlie Beach, and Winton, and all the finalists in this year’s Awards.

“The Top Tourism Town Awards shine a light on Queensland’s regional gems and reward communities united in delivering memorable holiday experiences.

“While attractions may drive guests to a destination, it is the warm welcome and meaningful customer service that has visitors leaving with a sense of wonderment. Congratulations to the winning communities for their remarkable efforts.

Tourism Minister Stirling Hinchliffe said building a great reputation as a Top Tourism Town takes a united, whole of community commitment to consistently excellent visitor experiences.

“Travelling the State as Tourism Minister, I’ve seen many destinations - big and small – delivering immersive Queensland tourism experiences that are absolutely world-class.

“Queensland has an awe-inspiring diversity of quality destinations, each vital to the industry led Towards Tourism 2032 roadmap for growing the State’s visitor economy.

“Congratulations to the winning communities and nominees for this year’s coveted Awards who’ve worked together to make Queensland the nation’s favourite holiday destination.”

State winners from the Top Tourism Town Awards will go on to represent Queensland at the national awards held later in the year, where they have the chance to be crowned the best in Australia.

The Queensland Top Tourism Town and Top Tour Guide Awards are made possible through the sponsorship of Racing Queensland and oOh!media.
