Two distinct designs were presented for a foreshore rejuvenation with one attracting overwhelming support.

Community engagement began in April 2022 to help guide the next stage of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation – the Central Meeting Place – which encompasses the Loo with a View.

Recently the community shared their thoughts on two design concepts, referred to as Concept Yellow and Concept Blue via council’s [survey](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/mooloolaba-foreshore-revitalisation-project-central-meeting-place)
&#x20;page.

At the historic first Ordinary Meeting at the new Sunshine Coast City Hall (January 25) councillors considered the community’s preferred option feedback.

They were presented with engineering reports and state authority advice before voting on – and endorsing - Concept Blue as the final design.

The 6500 square metre Stage Two Central Meeting Place will now proceed with detailed design - amending the previously adopted Place Making Mooloolaba Master Plan endorsed in 2015.

The precinct includes new viewing decks, meeting places, picnic areas, beach showers, significant native landscaping, integrated seawall and a coastal pathway.

The project also involves replacing the existing Loo with a View with fully inclusive public amenities - that are separate from the viewing deck and meeting place - to address its aged state and current accessibility issues.

Environment and Liveability Portfolio Councillor Peter Cox said that if we were to achieve a more active, sustainable, and accessible region - we must first design it.

“Feedback received from more than 1300 surveys and conversations with the community and stakeholder groups showed a clear preference,” Cr Cox said.

“Three quarters of respondents chose Concept Blue as their overall preferred design.

Concept Blue Artist Impression - Mooloolaba's Central Meeting Place.

“Many expressed that Concept Blue feels open, contemporary, and consistent with the green natural landscape we love most about Mooloolaba.

“The community was eager to maintain the new character, aesthetic and quality established in the Northern Parkland.

“As well as the layout and architectural style of Concept Blue, there was a clear preference for improved inclusion and accessibility with 69 per cent wanting public toilets and showers on the same level as the Mooloolaba Esplanade.

“Of the respondents, 73 per cent want an open-plan design allowing for more beachfront parkland, and 75 per cent want to separate the meeting and event area from the toilet block with a new, open-sided shade canopy that flows onto a large, grassed area.”

“Ensuring high quality community spaces is a top priority for our future,” Cr Cox said.

“We understand the vital contribution our urban places make to our healthy community, social inclusion, economic performance, and environmental safeguarding. 

“The Northern Parkland has provided a great boost to nearby businesses in Mooloolaba, and I have no doubt the next stage of the foreshore’s revitalisation will do the same.”  

The Central Meeting Place is located near the Brisbane Road entry point to Mooloolaba Esplanade. It is intended to be a place where our community can arrive, meet, gather, celebrate, and connect with nature and each other.

Funding and construction timelines for the next stage of the Mooloolaba Foreshore Revitalisation are yet to be determined and council will continue to keep the community informed.

#### **CONCEPT BLUE AT A GLANCE**

\*An open-sided, shade canopy inspired by nature, creates a new meeting place and event space, which flows onto a large, grassed area.

\*This open-plan design allows for increased beachfront parkland with new viewing decks, grassed areas and terraced seating.

\*Changing Places facilities and family change rooms, are located on the same level as Mooloolaba Esplanade for direct and easy access from the coastal pathway.

\*The public amenities are housed in ‘pods’ in the same architectural style as Stage One Northern Parkland.
