To celebrate the fresh new Mooloolaba Northern Parkland, the Esplanade is set to transform with oceans of free family-friendly fun on Saturday, November 5 from 10am–9pm.

Scrumptious seafood, sand sculptures, mermaids, live music and sea-inspired displays feature among the many highlights for the upcoming [Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival](https://events.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/event/16977760-a/mooloolaba-foreshore-festival)
.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the festival would be a great way to celebrate the new award-winning public space.

“We’ve partnered with Mooloolaba Chamber of Commerce to deliver the Mooloolaba Foreshore Festival, and we’re inviting the whole community to join us,” Cr Natoli said.

“Visitors can experience the new Northern Parkland and also sample delicious food and drinks along the Esplanade, enjoy free rides and face painting for the kids, discover incredible sand sculptures, artisan markets and live entertainment.

“There’s even a Mermaid Headquarters where you can meet a mermaid, and Neptune’s Garden Bar will provide refreshments, thanks to Diablo Co.”

Festival attendees are encouraged to catch public transport, cycle, scoot or walk to the event or conveniently park at the Mooloolaba Central ParknGo for $5 per day and accessible via Brisbane Road or Smith Street.

Economy Portfolio Councillor Jason O’Pray said there was so much to see and do in Mooloolaba – and that the new parkland was already proving to be a real drawcard for families.

“Increasing and beautifying beachfront parkland along this iconic strip is expected to lure thousands of additional visitors to the area, providing an estimated $5.5 million\* worth of extra expenditure in local businesses each year,” Cr O’Pray said.

“The feedback on the $16 million Stage One [Northern Parkland](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Sunshine-Coasts-newest-$16-million-beachfront-parkland-now-open?utm_source=miragenews&utm_medium=miragenews&utm_campaign=news)
&#x20;has been really positive and as plans progress for further upgrades along this beach front, it is really important that we continually support local businesses.”
