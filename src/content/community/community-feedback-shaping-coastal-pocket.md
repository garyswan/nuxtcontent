**Thank you for your feedback to help shape the future of Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park.**

The Point Cartwright Reserve and La Balsa Park Master Plan project team received a wide range of valuable feedback on the first round of community consultation between 29 November 2021 to 9 January 2022.

Our project team spoke with residents, businesses, visitors and community groups and listened to their ideas and concerns for this very popular reserve and park on the Sunshine Coast.

**THE VALUES AND VISION YOU WANT COUNCIL TO EMBRACE ARE:**

**The Environment** - preserve and enhance the site’s natural environmental values and scenic amenity.\
**Inclusive** - create an inclusive place for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy.\
Social and Recreational - maintain social connections, exercise opportunities and pet-friendly activities.\
**Improve Awareness** - provide education and awareness of the rich history of the site, the environmental values, and the significance of the land for Kabi Kabi people.

Don’t take our word for it! WATCH what the community had to say in this new video.

WATCH: Community feedback shaping Coastal pocket

Background documents are being prepared to explore the Cultural, Environmental and Recreational values of the site.

Later in 2022, we will ask the community ‘Have we got it right?’ in translating your values and vision in the draft master plan.

Watch this space!
