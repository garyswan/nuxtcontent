Local businesses and community organisations wanting to reduce their carbon footprint are being encouraged to sign-up to a free online workshop on September 8.

There they’ll discover how Sunshine Coast Council’s ASPIRE online marketplace can benefit their operations. 

The one-hour workshop details how the business-to-business circular economy platform operates and includes an opportunity for eligible attendees to register their business to the program for free.

&#x20;is an online marketplace which uses smart algorithms, matching business so they can exchange waste resources for repurpose or reuse the material and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.

Sunshine Coast Council Economic Development Councillor Terry Landsberg urged the local community to take advantage of the workshop.

“We encourage businesses, community or sporting groups, schools, childcare centres and entities with an ABN to be part of our region’s growing circular economy ecosystem,” Cr Landsberg said.

“Since we launched the program in October 2020, more than 160 local businesses have signed up to use ASPIRE and almost 400 tonnes of waste has been traded and diverted from landfill.

“This is a terrific result.

“This circular economy tool provides connecting opportunities which will grow our circular economy ecosystem.

“Changing our thinking and behaviour around treating waste as a resource is imperative if we are to continue our goal to becoming Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.”

Owner and founder of local company [Essence Building Group Pty Ltd](https://essencebuilding.com.au/)
&#x20;Brent Hennessy said his business was in the early days of its partnership with ASPIRE but the long-term outcomes and environmental benefits were already evident. 

“The building industry still has a lot of work to do to reduce the carbon footprint resulting from construction projects,” Mr Hennessey said.

“Essence Building Group is able to access the ASPIRE online marketplace at no cost under council’s existing licence.

“As a small family run local business, we’re incredibly grateful council is making these initiatives available to help companies trade our unusable construction materials so they can be reused rather than going to landfill.”

ASPIRE has been pivotal in connecting more than 1000 businesses across Australia to uncover their carbon emission savings by reducing their waste disposal costs.

Council was one of the first local governments in Queensland to invest in the ASPIRE platform.

Visit Council’s [website](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Business/Business-Programs/Circular-Economy)
&#x20;to check commodities that can be traded with likeminded local businesses and organisations. 

If your business disposes any of these commodities, then ASPIRE Marketplace can help by reducing, reusing, or repurposing these resources.

Be sure to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sunshine-coast-aspire-introduction-webinar-tickets-398635959887)
&#x20;to attend this free workshop to learn how your business can benefit from joining the Sunshine Coast’s circular economy and do you bit for our environment and future generations.
