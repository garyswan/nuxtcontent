To help the community stand strong and improve overall health and wellbeing, Sunshine Coast Council is proud to offer the fourth and final round of The Lift Project Sunshine Coast, starting May 31, with registrations now open. 

The free program is a holistic, evidence-based, online adventure that draws together the latest research from Neuroscience, Lifestyle Medicine and Positive Psychology.

This will be the final opportunity for the community to participate in The Lift Project Sunshine Coast. Registrations close May 27.

The creator of The Lift Project, internationally renowned lifestyle medicine expert Dr Darren Morton, said all levels of government and organisations needed to take care of the wellbeing of their communities.

“There is such a need for universal mental health interventions and to make these types of evidence-based treatments available to whole communities,” Dr Morton said.

“This is exactly what the Sunshine Coast has done with the implementation of The Lift Project.

“While it’s been great to have Sunshine Coast Council as the first community organisation to offer this program, what’s really stood out for me was the uptake.

“More than 4000 people have registered for the first three sessions which has been a record for us.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said it was because of these record numbers that council decided to extend the offering to a fourth round.

“The importance of taking time for mental health and wellbeing cannot be stressed enough, especially during this pandemic,” Cr Law said.

“When we started working with Dr Morton last year, council wanted to take a positive approach in making sure our residents are looking after their mental and physical wellbeing.

“The Lift Project Sunshine Coast has helped us reinforce our strength as a community, our resilience and active way of life, which, in turn, has allowed us to continue to shape our region to be healthy, smart and creative and continue our key actions as part of the [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
.”

Birtinya resident and program participant Trish Wegener applauded the council offering and how it had given back to the community.

“Council has been a trailblazer in using this program,” Ms Wegener said.

“I’ve been interested in self-development for more than 30 years, and I’ve even written a book on the subject, so I joined The Lift Project to further expand my knowledge.

“This is an incredibly valuable program with many important lessons, and I imagine that people who don’t have a background in this type of self-care would get a lot out of it.”

The Lift Project Sunshine Coast is suitable for all ages. Residents who have previously completed the program are welcome to participate again.

From May 31, registered participants will receive 10 weekly emails with topics including: learning about the “emotional brain”, why activity and being outdoors is crucial, the importance of community, boosting your emotional wellbeing, what it takes to flourish and much more.

Included in the program is a free downloadable eBook that includes prompts and learnings each week, giving participants the opportunity to self-assess and look back on progress To register, please visit [www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/liftproject](http://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/liftproject)
