Olympians and Paralympians from the Sunshine Coast who competed at the Tokyo Games will be congratulated at a massive civic reception next week.

The welcome home event, to be held at USC Stadium on October 7, has been organised by Federal Member for Fairfax, Ted O’Brien MP, in conjunction with the Sunshine Coast Council, Noosa Council and the University of the Sunshine Coast.

Special Envoy for the 2032 Olympic Games Ted O’Brien MP said that it was important for residents to have the opportunity to show appreciation for our local Olympians and Paralympians.

“The Tokyo Games were one of our strongest performances ever”, Ted O’Brien MP said.\
“There’s so much for locals to be proud of with our local Paralympians snagging 14 medals - almost 18 percent of Australia’s total medal count.

“This followed a stellar performance by Olympians such as Sunshine Coast local, now world-famous Kaylee McKeown, who came home with four medals, including three gold.” Mr O’Brien said.

“Paralympic swimmer, Benjamin Hance, wasn’t far behind, coming home with a medal of each colour, and Lakeisha “Lucky” Patterson secured gold in the Women’s 400m Freestyle.” Mr O’Brien added.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said Sunshine Coast locals should be proud of the achievements of our Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

“They did our Sunshine Coast and Australia proud at these Games, with some incredible sporting achievements, and provided hope and inspiration to the world when the world needed it most,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This Welcome Home free event is a wonderful opportunity for our community to be part of celebrations and inspire many other young athletes to strive to follow their dreams.

“The Sunshine Coast Council is a key delivery partner in the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games and our local Olympians and Paralympians will be an integral part of supporting our road-to-glory journey together towards 2032.”

Noosa Deputy Mayor, Cr Frank Wilkie said that the Sunshine Coast Welcome Home Celebration was particularly special as it would be one of Australia’s first opportunities to congratulate their returning Olympians and Paralympians.

“We’re all so incredibly proud of them. With the added challenge of training and competing during a global pandemic, our local Olympians and Paralympians have had to work much harder, not only physically, but mentally, to achieve their Olympic dreams,” Mr Wilkie said.

“They’re an inspiration, and role models to all of our local young Olympic hopefuls keen to follow in their footsteps.”

USC Vice-Chancellor and President Professor Helen Bartlett said the University was proud to host this important event at its sports precinct where many of the region’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes had trained for the Tokyo Games.

Professor Bartlett said USC’s strong focus on high-performance sport had played an important role in Australia’s success at the Games.

“I’d like to congratulate the athletes on their amazing results in Tokyo, especially our current students, graduates and members of the USC-based high-performance swimming and cycling teams,” she said.

“And I would also like to commend the work of our Olympic and Paralympic officials that included high-profile USC academic experts in sport science, coaching, nutrition and psychology.”

Thirty-seven (37) athletes and officials from the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics Games call the Sunshine Coast home, as do dozens more Olympians and Paralympians from previous Olympics.
