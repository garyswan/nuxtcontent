**UPDATE: The Festive Garden is now fully booked. We look forward to seeing many happy faces at the Gardens. If you can no longer make it, please email event organisers at events\@sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au so the tickets can be re-released to ensure others waiting for tickets may have the opportunity to enjoy The Festive Garden. For all event info, follow the [Facebook event page](https://fb.me/e/18n7nszbu)
, where updates will be posted on the night and throughout the five nights of The Festive Garden**

Imagine crossing the threshold of a magical wonderland where you’re greeted by elves, serenaded by carollers and the night is aglow with a forest of twinkling lights. Step forward and enter, ‘The Festive Garden’.

Bookings open November 24 for council’s latest Christmas offering, which will see the Maroochy Bushland Botanic Gardens, in Tanawha, transformed into a Christmas wonderland from December 17 to 21.

Sunshine Coast Council community portfolio councillor David Law said the walk-through experience was free and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.

“Expect to find Christmas spirit in abundance, beautiful lights in a magical setting, face painting, Santa, letters to the big man himself, elves, entertainment and food trucks,” Cr Law said

“Visitors should allow 1.5 hours on site for a truly magical experience.

“Getting to the event is simple thanks to a free park and ride service, but bookings are essential.

“We expect thousands will want to attend the new festive experience, so to ensure we can accommodate everyone, we’ve teamed up with Sunbus to deliver a free shuttle.”

Buses will run continuously between the University of the Sunshine Coast and the Botanic Gardens from 5.30pm, with the last bus returning at 9pm each evening.

Visitors should park at the University of the Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Drive, Sippy Downs and wait for a free shuttle bus to take them to the experience.

The last bus will leave the University at 8pm and the travel time is about 12 minutes each way.

Access to the experience is via park and ride only—patrons will not be able to park or enter directly from the garden.

The Sunbus Express is accessibility compliant and able to accommodate wheelchairs, strollers, and mobility devices.
