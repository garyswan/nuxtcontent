Radio announcer and now author Sheridan Stewart is celebrating the release of her brand-new book *I Am Enough* and is quick to acknowledge how her local library played a part in her writing journey.

Sheridan regularly visited Coolum Library as a writing haven, with its calm and inviting space and excellent vista of the Jack Morgan Park.

Her debut book, which began as a 90-Day challenge simply to spend less, contemplates what it means to have enough, do enough and ultimately be enough.

Sheridan said the book came from a single page journal entry which she looked at and thought “that’s a book’’.

“The personal stories illustrate the *I Am Enough, I Do Enough, I Have Enough* – the overdoing, the over wanting and the over working are very relatable,” Sheridan said.

### Writers are often digital nomads and libraries worldwide provide safe havens for creative work.

“I found writing at home could be quite distracting and because I had the idea of non-essential spending, I remembered my library,” Sheridan said.

“I’ve always advocated for libraries - as child, as a teenager, the quietness, the alone time, the people mostly.

“We spend money so habitually that we walk straight pass the things that are completely free.

“The library offers free Wi-Fi, air conditioning, printing that’s incredibly affordable and people who can help you with technology when you need it.

### “The staff here are fantastic. No one ever makes you feel bad if you ask a question or need help. It’s such a great space and when I walk in my shoulders drop and I say I am here.”

Sheridan’s book is now available on the library catalogue. Reserve your copy of *[I Am Enough](https://sunshinecoast.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=&BRN=891524)
