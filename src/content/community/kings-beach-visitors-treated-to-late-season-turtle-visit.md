Last Friday night at around 8pm a turtle laid a nest at Kings Beach - this was unexpected as it's quite late in the season.

However, our TurtleCare volunteers arrived quickly to be on stand by in case any help was needed.

This nesting turtle had quite an audience though - also watching closely were local people out enjoying the beautiful evening.

Our volunteers have passed on this message of thanks.

"Many members of the public always thank us for the work that we do for our turtles, but the Shelly Beach Group Leaders and volunteers wish to thank the members of the public. We were so impressed with the respect and interest shown by the public who watched the event. They were inquisitive, respectful, followed directions, turned off their flashes, and remained behind the turtle at all times when she returned to the water. It was fantastic for us to share such a wonderful experience of a laying turtle with many excited members of the public, and very humbling for us to share our passion by teaching the public a little about our love of sea turtles."

We thank-you too for your respectful turtle-watching and for being a turtle friendly community.

HOW YOU CAN HELP DURING TURTLE SEASON

üê¢Report turtle tracks, new nests and emerging hatchlings to our Turtle Care hotline or Coolum and North Shore Coast Care.

üëÄFor sightings on the southern end of the coast call 0437 559 067 and for sightings from Mooloolaba north call Coolum and North Shore Coast Care on 0478 435 377.

üí°‚ùåSwitch off your outside lights from 8pm as light pollution is distracting for turtles and hatchlings

üóëÔ∏èMake sure you take your rubbish with you from the beach so the turtles have a clean environment to lay their eggs in.

All TurtleCare activities are conducted under Queensland Turtle Conservation Project permits.
