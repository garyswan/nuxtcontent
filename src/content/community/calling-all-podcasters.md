Whether you’re a storyteller, content creator or podcast addict, now’s your chance to get into the studio and behind the mic to record your story.

Sunshine Coast Council Libraries has today (Wednesday 14 April) launched a new professional quality podcast studio right here at Kawana Library.

Get on board the global podcast phenomenon with more than 1.7 million podcasts and 43 million episodes worldwide in 2021. This is your chance to become a content creator and join the 1% minority who produce their own podcasts.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the new podcast studio was a wonderful addition to our library network and would provide the Sunshine Coast community with opportunities to develop new digital skills in podcast production.

“The Libraries’ podcast studio will provide a space for locals to record their own podcasts in the first publicly owned and operated studio on the Sunshine Coast,” Cr Law said.

“StoryCast Studios is available for library members, community groups, businesses or sporting clubs to book – whether you’re tech savvy or just interested in giving podcasting a go.

“StoryCast Studios will be open to book from Monday 19 April and recording sessions will be free to try until June 30, 2021.

“The purpose-built podcast studio provides access to high quality audio equipment, including a podcast production mixer with four studio mics and headphones.

“I can’t wait to listen to local podcasts produced here at StoryCast Studios and I’m sure this new facility will inspire locals considering podcast start-up projects and others who’d like to record their stories.

“Libraries will also be providing customers with a range of online podcast resources and training opportunities. Workshops will focus on developing podcast ideas, how to capture quality audio, editing techniques, how to upload files and market your podcast episodes.

“So, make sure you visit the library website to find out more, explore the training options and book your recording session!”

Minister for the Arts Leeanne Enoch said this project has been brought to life thanks to a $19,000 grant from the Palaszczuk Government.

“Libraries are vital community hubs that provide spaces and programs for story telling,” Minister Enoch said.

“And this has been enhanced at the Kawana Library through the new podcast studio.

“More and more Queenslanders are listening to podcasts, and this new studio is a great way for people in the community to develop new skills, embrace their creativity and tell their stories.”

StoryCast Studios is a Sunshine Coast Council Libraries initiative proudly funded and supported by the Queensland Government and the State Library of Queensland through the Strategic Priorities grants program.
