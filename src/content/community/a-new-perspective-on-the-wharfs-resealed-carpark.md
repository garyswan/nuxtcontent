It’s out with the old and in with the new smoother and safer car park at popular waterfront precinct The Wharf Mooloolaba thanks to a $1.1 million Sunshine Coast Council upgrade.

The works were accelerated to be completed in time for the Mooloolaba Triathlon allowing visitors and locals to access the precinct safely, with the car park between River Esplanade and Sea Life resurfaced.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said while there was short-term pain for businesses and the community he was impressed with how quickly the works were completed given the wet weather plaguing February and March.

“I would like to thank residents, businesses and visitors for their patience and understanding while council undertook night works, and some weekend works, to deliver the new and improved parking area,” Cr Natoli said.   

“I also want to thank the Council staff who worked closely with the affected residents and businesses and kept open communication with them at all times.

“The $1.1 million rehabilitation works funded by council, The Wharf and Sealife, ultimately improve safety and access to the precinct for all road users especially for beach goers, customers to the complex and riders and walkers to the marina.   

“The high-traffic area was showing signs of wear and tear on the pavement and asphalt which needed immediate attention.

“To minimise the disruption as best we could, we started works in November 2021 and halted for the Christmas break. We resumed works at the end of January 2022 and accelerated the program to have the project completed in time for the Mooloolaba Triathlon.

“The [birds-eye-view](https://youtu.be/K3f3eWvw5UA)
&#x20;of the project area is a refreshing perspective of how great the high-demand area looks now it’s back in top shape.”

Upgrades to our road infrastructure is vital in supporting the Sunshine Coast’s rapid growth.

Transport Portfolio Councillor Rick Baberowski said whether it be small or major upgrades across the Coast to the Hinterland, they all played a key role in keeping our region safe and connected.

“Walkers and runners are enjoying pounding the new pathway along Parkyn Parade, Mooloolaba,” Cr Baberowski said.

“The first phase of the project was replacing the old, deteriorated path with a new 2-metre-wide pathway, which was completed prior to the triathlon. Further renewals are planned for later this year.

“Council will also be installing two pedestrian crossings, one located near Penny Lane and the second at The Wharf car park entrance to ensure safety for our locals and visitors crossing to the popular precinct.

“These works started at the end of March and will include speed cushions, median islands and additional lighting.  

“The pedestrian crossings and pathways will significantly improve safety for families, walkers and riders and create ease of access when enjoying all Mooloolaba has to offer between main beach and The Wharf.”

Crossing works are expected to be completed around May, weather and site conditions permitting.
