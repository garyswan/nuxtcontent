Planning is now underway with Sunshine Coast Council for the Caloundra Indoor Stadium to return as a community vaccination location in coming months.

The centre is scheduled to open in October and run until December 2021.

Sunshine Coast Health’s COVID-19 vaccination lead and Executive Director Nursing and Midwifery Suzanne Metcalf thanked Sunshine Coast Council for allowing the use of this location again following the success of the first vaccination centre in June.

“More than 14,000 people rolled up their sleeves for a COVID-19 vaccination when we were at the centre in June,” Ms Metcalf said.

“We’re excited to be able to reinstate this service and further enhance access to the free COVID-19 vaccine for Sunshine Coast residents.

“We’ll keep the community informed when this vaccination centre is due to reopen, but in the meantime all eligible residents should register now to be vaccinated.

“This gives you the opportunity to be vaccinated at one of our current vaccination locations, or at the Caloundra Indoor Stadium when appointments are made available.

“To date, Sunshine Coast Health has administered more than 100,000 vaccinations as locals come forward to protect themselves and their loved ones.

“We’re grateful to Sunshine Coast Council for enabling us to use this wonderful facility once again,” she said.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson encouraged all eligible residents to roll up their sleeves to get the jab and protect themselves and others in the community.

“I’m calling on our eligible Sunshine Coast community to jump online now, register for the jab, and take advantage of this opportunity right on our doorstep,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This community vaccination centre is strongly supported by our council.

“I’d particularly like to thank all the sporting clubs and other organisations who normally use the stadium that are working with council to try and relocate their various competitions and events for the few months while this critical vaccination service is made available to our community. 

“COVID-19 doesn’t discriminate. It’s deadly and sadly it’s infecting many people, young and old, plus those who are fit and healthy.

“Vaccination will support our community to find a pathway out of the pandemic. 

“We don’t want to see vulnerable members of our community and our elderly infected with this highly infectious and deadly disease, or our businesses closing for good due to repeated lockdowns well into the next year.”
