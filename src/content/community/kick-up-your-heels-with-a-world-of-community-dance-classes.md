Five, six, seven eight … it’s time to move to the groove with the return of Healthy Sunshine Coast’s popular community dance activities.

Get Up & Dance! offers six different dance workshops and invites people to shimmy, shuffle, twirl, toe tap, boot scoot, bend, dip and twist their way to better health in just four weeks. The activities start from 23 May and bookings are open now.

Dance instructor Bec Combs of Rhythm Culture Dance said her classes would be a blend of Afro funk and West African dance.

“We’ll be doing a super fun fast-paced warm-up with West African dance moves from Guinea, West Africa, then we’ll work on our choreography to some really funky recorded music,” Ms Combs said.

“Dance is absolutely incredible for your physical and mental health. The wonderful thing about it is that you don't actually feel like you are working out, and when you are moving in sync with others there is a type of connectedness and charged energy that is created among the group.

“The great thing about community dance is that you don't need to take it seriously, you don't even have to be any good. It's all about just moving your body and having loads of fun. Nobody comes to be amazing, everybody has the same objective – to get fit and have fun.”

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the Get Up & Dance! low-cost workshops would be held at multiple locations across the Coast.

“There’s so much to choose from at five different areas – Beerwah, Caloundra, Palmwoods, Maroochydore and Coolum,” Cr Law said.

“Choices include Tibetan Khaita Joyful, Rhythm Culture African, Line Dancing with a very modern twist, Latin American Zumba and Mega Step Dance – which brings step out of the gym and onto the dance floor.

 “Now’s the perfect time for anyone who has been wanting to return to exercise, missing community events or just loves dancing to join hundreds of other people who choose to move with Healthy Sunshine Coast.

“This program forms part of our [Sunshine Coast Community Strategy 2019-2041](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/Planning-and-Projects/Regional-Strategies/Sunshine-Coast-Community-Strategy-2019-to-2041)
&#x20;which aims to encourage healthy and active lifestyles by supporting increased physical activity.”
