If you think this park with swings, slides and climbing nets, plus nature-based play and quiet green nooks, couldn’t get any better – you had better think again.

Looming eight-metres, a new multi-level play tower with two large slides at Albany Lakes Park, Sippy Downs, has been made even cooler with new shade sails and a sheltered barbecue area.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 6 Councillor Christian Dickson said the local attraction, 18 Albany Street, Sippy Downs was the place to be to let the kids run wild.

“Since the park underwent a $380,000 upgrade in July last year, I’m pleased to see the second stage completed in time for the Christmas break,” Cr Dickson said.

“Council has partnered with the Queensland Government to deliver each stage of the Albany Lakes Park Landscape Concept Plan providing an inviting place to spend time outdoors and connect as a community.

“I’ve heard from many parents the importance of making sure their children are shaded when having fun outside.

“While shade is always a key consideration by council when upgrading play infrastructure, it’s not always possible to have natural shade.

“So, when funding becomes available, we ensure provisions are made. The new sails to Albany Lakes Park certainly provide adequate shade across the play space.

“I’m pleased to be able to deliver a welcoming and cool environment for all age groups and abilities to enjoy no matter the season.”

The Palaszczuk Government committed $600,000 under the South East Queensland Community Stimulus Program for Stage 2 upgrades.

The Member for Caloundra Jason Hunt said the Palaszczuk Government was proud to support this project as part of the program, building on $150,000 allocated to Stage 1 works through the Unite and Recover Community Stimulus Package.

The Palaszczuk Government is delivering for the Sunshine Coast, improving our already great lifestyle,” Mr Hunt said.

“This is shaping up to be a great park for local kids to make the most of the Sunshine Coast lifestyle and grow up loving our region.

“By investing in our lifestyle we’re keeping the Sunny Coast as one of the best places to raise a family and creating good jobs for locals while we’re at it.”

Sippy Downs has cemented itself as the playground capital with Albany Lakes and [Sippy Downs Forest Park](https://oursc.com.au/featured/new-sippy-downs-park-to-tap-into-young-wildlings)
&#x20;expected to be ready for young wildlings by early 2023!

Cr Dickson said the new forest park was beginning to take shape with pathways, boardwalks, shelters and an amenities building.

“The highly anticipated tree top tower has also begun with the rest of the playground to follow,” Cr Dickson said. 

“I’m really eager to see this new park spring from the ground offering shaded meadows, forest experiences, an outdoor classroom and social spaces for all to enjoy.”

Further pathway and balustrade works will take place over the next few months as the playground areas are completed with landscaping and furniture to be installed.
