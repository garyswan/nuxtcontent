In the lead up to National Volunteer Week (May 16–22), Sunshine Coast Council has released a must-watch new video series which reveals the generosity of volunteers as they play their part in making our region a great place to live.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said National Volunteer Week was a chance to say thank you as we celebrated and recognised the vital work of Sunshine Coast volunteers.

“I’d like to express my gratitude to volunteers right across the Sunshine Coast, who willingly give their time, efforts and experience for nothing in return,” Cr Law said.

“We are very grateful to have about 870 passionate active volunteers who partner with council to deliver vital services across so many areas such as helping people learn to read, looking after our environment and wildlife, preserving our history, delivering exciting events and sharing our region’s stories.

“Already in the first five months of 2022, these volunteers have generously donated a staggering 15,000 hours of their own time.

“However, volunteering delivers many more benefits to our community than this immediate support.

“Volunteering connects people, it brings people together; it builds communities and creates a better society for everyone

“The theme for 2022 National Volunteer Week ‘Better Together’ reflects this important element.

“So does the [video series released by council today.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN6q_1UaRZU6PiPjg1OqXwaixLxnNCkXD)


“In it, one volunteer, John, explains how Bush Care allowed him to connect with a gentleman who needed support during a difficult time.

“And Alan describes how volunteering at Bankfoot House meant he has been able to reconnect with a lost passion.

“Warren has been able to use the skills gained over his career to support people as they begin theirs, while making friends for life.

“These are only a few of the stories being shared.

“Through these videos, our community can see how volunteering makes a real difference personally for each volunteer and for our community.

“And how the volunteer’s generosity helps to create a stronger, more sustainable, healthy, smart, creative region.

“For those interested in volunteering through council, I invite you to visit our libraries, environmental visitor centres or other facilities, check out our website or have a chat with any of the council officers who look after volunteer programs.”
