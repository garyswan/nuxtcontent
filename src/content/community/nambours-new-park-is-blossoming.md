Nambour residents are in for a treat with lush landscaping and shaded picnic areas in the town’s new parkland providing the perfect place to relax.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 10 Councillor David Law said the recently completed $650,000 stage one works would provide a 1.7 hectare green boost for the hinterland town.

“I’m very pleased to see the community already using the open space which adds to a network of parklands running through Nambour,” Cr Law said.

“Council started this stage of works in June 2021 on the parcel of land adjoining the existing Quota Memorial Park which enhances the overall Petrie Creek open space corridor.

“The corridor stretches from Arundell Avenue roundabout to Crusher Park just beyond the Nambour Showgrounds.

“The stage one works are part of the wider park upgrade to create more green spaces and family-friendly areas for existing residents, visitors and new people set to call Nambour home in the future.

“Footpaths now connect to Quota Memorial Park and the project includes 45,000 native trees and shrubs, creekside landscaping, and open green spaces for our community to socialise and enjoy time outdoors.

“This upgrade is very natural and is about encouraging our community to take a break from our busy work lives and our screens by relaxing and unwinding surrounded by nature.

“This is a great space to have lunch, a virtual meeting, kick a ball with friends or take the family to throw a frisbee, or fly a kite.

“This natural open space is part of council’s commitment to becoming Australia’s most sustainable region - healthy, smart, creative.”

This project is part of the Petrie Creek Parklands Open Space Master Plan which was endorsed by council in late 2017 and is delivering on Council’s Environment and Liveability Strategy to provide long-term direction to guide growth and shape the future of our region.

Stage two works, replacing the existing Bridge to Quota Park, are expected to start mid-year.  

Sunshine Coast Council consulted with the community in 2018, asking what they would like to see in the new park and one of the main requests was a dog off-leash area which has been delivered as part of stage one works.

Council has worked closely on the design of the park with Kabi Kabi First Nations representatives and with the Petrie Creek Catchment Group to incorporate their feedback for increased vegetation.
