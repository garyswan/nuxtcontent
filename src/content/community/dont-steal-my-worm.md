To avoid food competition on the sandbank, each species of shorebirds has a different beak shape and length, perfectly adapted to pick their favourite food. The birds are busy picking, so share our shore and keep your distance to help the birds put on weight. 

### Ideas to share our coastline with shorebirds

Shorebirds are easily disturbed by people, dogs, vehicles and watercrafts getting too close to the birds and causing them to fly away. You can help protect our shorebirds by:

*   Observing from a distance using binoculars
*   Not running at flocks of shorebirds
*   Choosing a location away from the birds for your activities
*   Keeping your dogs under control
*   Taking your rubbish home
