Whether you are new to the Sunshine Coast or have been here all your life, community gardens are a great way to meet people, share or learn gardening skills, grow your own food, compost, prepare and enjoy foods and more.

These gardens provide an opportunity to learn about sustainable living.

They also help build a sense of community and support your wellbeing and connection with the environment.
