Want to improve the way you move, eat, sleep, think and connect with others? Then this low-cost health and wellbeing program is for you.

It’s time to run, jump, and groove into Sunshine Coast Council’s Healthy Sunshine Coast program, which has bounced back for 2023 with classes being held across the region.

Healthy Sunshine Coast is an affordable and holistic community health and wellbeing initiative that supports and encourages our community to be active, have fun and meet new friends.

### The aim of the program is to encourage:

*   positive mental health and resilience
*   regular physical activity
*   healthy eating
*   strong social connections
*   participation across all ages and abilities.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said the 2023 program had something for everyone, from GROOVE dance at Kenilworth, meditation and Forest Bathing at the Maroochy Botanical Gardens, over 50s fitness at Buderim and so much more.

“We hope to get everyone on the Sunshine Coast involved to foster a happier, healthier and more connected region,” Cr Law said.

, but essential. Once signed up, local residents will be able to attend a range of low-cost health and wellbeing activities around the region, which are either $10 (or $5 with a Health Care/Pensioner card).

Registered participants will receive email updates on information on classes and how to book.

Activities will be added over time. Ensure you are registered to keep up to date. For more information and to register, visit council’s website and search ‘Healthy Sunshine Coast’.
