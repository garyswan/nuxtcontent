The Sunshine Coast Youth Council has developed a short survey and a series of pop-up stalls to better understand the priorities for young people within the region.

Five $50 vouchers are up for grabs for 15 to 24 year olds living on the Sunshine Coast who complete the survey by December 19.

The information will help guide the Youth Council’s priorities, connectivity and future advocacy on the Sunshine Coast.

Sunshine Coast Council established the [Youth Council](https://www.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Council/News-Centre/Young-minds-meet-to-spearhead-community-issues-290621)
&#x20;earlier this year, which features 15 representatives from across the region.

Community Portfolio Councillor David Law encouraged young people to have their say today.

“We really need to hear from young people so we can gain a clearer understanding of their perspectives, ideas, interests and priorities, to ensure that we are at the forefront of youth issues” Cr Law said.

“It’s very important their voices are represented and heard so the Youth Council can advocate on their behalf and develop the priorities for the Youth Council.”

Youth Council member Gunter Nolle, 18, of Caloundra, said he had enjoyed being part of the group.

“We meet monthly and it’s a great opportunity to make a difference,” Mr Nolle said.

“There’s lots of issues facing youth at the moment so I encourage as many young people as possible aged 15 to 24 to take advantage of this platform and complete this survey or drop in to one of the pop-up stalls next month.”

Two pop-up stalls will be held:

*   Wednesday, December 8, 11am-1pm at Alex Skate Park
*   Friday, December 10, 4.30-6.30pm at Marcoola Twilight Markets

People can complete the survey by visiting <https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/youth-survey>


Sunshine Coast Council has successfully supported and worked alongside the region’s young people for many years. This has taken on various forms from Youth Week activities, supporting the Youth network, Youth Action Groups, Speak Up Engage, development of a Youth Action Plan 2018 and targeted conversations and consultations. Each of these have inspired the newly formed Youth Council 2021.
