Smoother roads and investments in projects that make it easier to bask in the region’s natural beauty are key inclusions for Division 9 in Sunshine Coast Council’s 2023-24 Budget.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said suburbs across the area would receive a budget boost.

The division incorporates Bli Bli, Coolum Beach, Doonan, Marcoola, Maroochy River, Mount Coolum, Pacific Paradise, Peregian Beach, Peregian Springs, Valdora, Verrierdale, Weyba Downs and Yandina Creek.

“Council’s billion-dollar budget includes a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better and more sustainable Sunshine Coast,” Cr Suarez said. 

“Whether it’s a small or big investment, each of these projects contributes towards making the area a great place to live. 

“Investment in the growing suburb of Bli Bli continues with the continued upgrade of Camp Flat Road.

“There will also be improvements to parks, playgrounds and trails across the suburb, including new seating at Waigani Street Park, a new drinking fountain at Kingfisher Drive Park and work to restore the trails at Parklands Conservation Park. 

“While the detailed planning for the future of Lions-Norrie Job Park continues, Coolum locals and visitors will start to see some of the initial multi-staged works begin.

“There will also be fence, seat and shower updates to local parks across the suburb and it should be easier to exit the Coolum Sports Complex with the continued upgrade to the intersection onto David Low Way.’’

Cr Suarez said Verrierdale residents would see the restoration of the Doonan Creek Environment Reserve, with $300,000 to progress the walking trails and other items.

“Peregian Springs State School students will have a safer trip to school with a new bus shelter on the cards and an upgrade to Longwood Drive pathway,” Cr Suarez said.

“The continued staged upgrade to sealed roads on North Arm Yandina Creek Road, at Yandina Creek, and the design of the gravel road upgrade on Lakewood Drive, Peregian Beach, which when constructed will make the trip a lot more pleasant for regular road user, are other Division 9 projects.

“And for our whole region, around $21.5 million will be invested in the next financial year to upgrade the Nambour waste precinct at Bli Bli to sustainably manage our region’s future waste and take another step towards our goal to become a zero-net emissions organisation by 2041.

“Work will deliver a new state-of-the-art Materials Recovery Facility, a new Resource Recovery Centre and landfill improvements for a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future.’’

Council handed down its 2023-24 Budget on June 22.
