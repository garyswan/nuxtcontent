Sunshine Coast residents are invited to join in a popular First Nations community event which was postponed earlier in the year due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The Wan’diny Family Fun Day will take place on Wednesday, September 22, from 10am-3pm at the Nambour Crushers field with a variety of activities scheduled.

A Welcome to Country will kick-off the festivities, followed by Gubbi Gubbi and Torres Strait Islander performers, cultural workshops and music.

Sunshine Coast Council Community Portfolio Councillor David Law said he was pleased to see Wan’diny back on for the whole community to enjoy.

“NAIDOC Week and its related events is a time for our community to acknowledge and attribute respect to Elders past and present of the First Nations peoples,” Cr Law said.

“This year’s theme is Heal Country! and calls on everyone to continue seeking greater protections for our lands, waters, sacred sites and cultural heritage.

“I encourage everyone to join in this wonderful event. It will be a great activity during the first week of the school holidays.”

In July, Council held its annual flag-raising ceremony at its Nambour administration building.

Earlier this year Council unanimously endorsed its Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan 2021-2022. The plan aims to develop a culturally capable workplace at council, promoting respect and valuing the skills, experience and perspectives of First Nations employees and representatives in the community.
