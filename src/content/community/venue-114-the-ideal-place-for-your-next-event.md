Whether it’s a national touring event, quality theatre performance, live music gig, corporate function, expo or private celebration, Venue 114 has a diverse range of spaces on offer to create and celebrate your special event.

Located alongside the picturesque Lake Kawana, [Venue 114](https://venue114.com.au/spaces/venue-114)
&#x20;has hosted some of the biggest names on the entertainment scene, from Amy Shark to Guy Sebastian and popular children’s sold-out performances including The Wiggles, *Possum Magic* and *Magical World of Crazy Science*.

Spanning three levels, this modern facility has an impressive 15 spaces for hire including three halls equipped with high quality sound and lighting infrastructure, an outdoor stage, meeting rooms, function room and lakeside courtyard all capturing stunning lake views.

Venue 114 Manager Louise Thompson said the in-demand, Sunshine Coast Council owned and operated venue thrived on being able to accommodate such a diverse range of amazing events and generate a vibrant, engaging community hub.

“Having the opportunity to program and produce events is an extremely positive initiative as we source quality talent and performances that suits the Sunshine Coast demographic,” Ms Thompson said.

“A prime example of this was the recent In Conversation event celebrating International Women’s Day with the incredible seven-time world surfing champion Layne Beachley as guest speaker.

“Receiving a standing ovation from the 300-plus audience was extremely rewarding and we look forward to showcasing our next In Conversation event featuring rugby union great and leadership legend John Eales in July.

“Venue 114’s professional, friendly team are committed to delivery of service excellence and providing a welcoming, inclusive, COVID Safe space for artists, performers and the community to cultivate and immerse in.

“Unfortunately COVID-19 has affected the venues and performing arts industry immensely and although unable to currently host standing events to 100 per cent capacity, it is fantastic to be operational again and we are now more creative and innovative on how best to accommodate each event while maintaining the WOW factor for our patrons.”

In addition to Venue 114, the community can also hire one of council’s owned and operated Community Spaces which includes Beerwah Community Hall, Bellvista Meeting Place, Kawana Community Hall and Kawana Island Meeting Place.
