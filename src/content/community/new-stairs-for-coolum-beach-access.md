Coolum residents will soon be stepping down to the beach from a new set of robust timber and aluminum stairs, designed to look and feel similar to the existing set.

Work to replace the damaged stairs at beach access 77 is due to begin in October.

It comes after erosion earlier in the year revealed wood rot and other structural defects.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 Councillor Maria Suarez said council worked to keep beach accesses in good condition.

“An engineer’s review at beach access 77 stairs showed wood rot had damaged the structure,” Cr Suarez said.

“After considering the options, council decided that replacing the stairs with a new aluminum and timber set offered the best value for money.

“The new set will be strong, last a long time and require minimal maintenance.

“It will still have timber treads and balustrades to keep that coastal texture and feel similar to the beach access 83 at Third Bay.

The finished stairs will look similar to the upgraded set at BA83 (Third bay).

“The beach is an important part of our Sunshine Coast lifestyle and these designated entry points help to protect the dunes and coastal foreshore areas from erosion and damage.

“We thank the community for their patience while we work to restore safe access for our community.”

Construction is scheduled to start after school holidays and will be completed in approximately four to five weeks, weather dependent.
