Sunshine Coast Council will host New Year’s Eve 2021 fireworks displays at Coolum, Caloundra and Mooloolaba.

The displays will be held at 8.30pm at all locations, with an additional midnight display at Mooloolaba.

Sunshine Coast Council Mayor Mark Jamieson said New Year’s Eve would be relaxed and family friendly across the region.

“This New Year’s Eve we are stepping back from the highly organised New Year’s Eve event and associated entertainment previously delivered at Mooloolaba and focussing solely on offering three fireworks displays that can be enjoyed from a number of locations across the coast,” Mayor Jamieson said.

“This new approach is in line with community feedback council received earlier this year during our festive program review.

”This year we are encouraging locals and visitors to throw down a rug and enjoy a picnic at beaches and parks or enjoy the hospitality of local cafes and restaurants at all three locations.

“At Coolum and Caloundra, we’re working with community groups who are delivering the fireworks events. 

“Families are encouraged to leave the car at home and walk or cycle or use public transport to travel to their nearest celebration.

“The low-key approach to New Year’s Eve will allow for social distancing during the fireworks display, while our local restaurants and cafes will benefit from pre-event bookings.

“New Year’s Eve is always a wonderful chance to reflect and look ahead with optimism so, no matter how people choose to celebrate, I wish everyone a safe, happy and healthy 2022.”

Sunshine Coast Council Coordinator Creative Arts and Events Janine Symons said the three fireworks celebrations would, as usual, be glass and alcohol-free environments.

“Visitors can expect a safe, less crowded New Year’s Eve experience, with roving entertainers for the kids,” Ms Symons said.

“We’re encouraging people to share the evening with friends and loved ones, grab a picnic or book into their local restaurant before settling in for the fireworks.

“Weather permitting, we’re using larger more eco-friendly fireworks, which have the benefit of firing higher in the sky, so can be seen from multiple vantage points.

“We recommend finding a comfortable spot, in any of the three locations, to watch the display.

“Ensuring our fireworks are as environmentally friendly as possible is crucial and our supplier provides fireworks that contain no plastic, chlorates and also contain less lifting powder, all of which reduce emissions.

“All cardboard waste and copper ignition wire is fully recycled post display.”

Council’s New Year’s Eve celebrations are delivered in conjunction with Queensland Police Service, Queensland Ambulance Service and Queensland Fire and Emergency Service.

Queensland Police Service officer Senior Sergeant Matt Robertson said there were a few things everyone could do to ensure a safe and happy New Year.

“We encourage everyone to take a common-sense approach and be mindful of COVID-19 safety practices and social distancing rules,” Senior Sergeant Robertson said.

“We also urge people to plan their journey ahead of time, whether that be public transport, a taxi or active transport, know how you’re getting to and from the displays.

“For those who choose to drive, parking is available at ParknGo Mooloolaba Central and pre-booking is recommended. There is limited parking at Kings Beach, Caloundra and Tickle Park, Coolum.”
