Action, adventure and prizes are up for grabs as part of a brain-boosting Summer Reading Club.

Sunshine Coast Libraries are behind the free interactive program, which offers fun for the whole family.

From Thursday, December 1, children and teenagers are invited to register and read for the chance to win great prizes.

Community Portfolio Councillor Cr David Law said the Summer Reading Club was not only fun, but it also encouraged students to keep their brains active over the school holidays.

“Continuing to read over the school breaks, whether a book, audiobook, graphic novel or picture book, helps children transition back to school in the new year,” Cr Law said.

“The Summer Reading Club is so valuable because it’s supporting kids to expand their vocabulary, literacy development and opening up new worlds of characters and stories to discover.”

Whether going away, or staying at home these holidays, stimulating adventure, action and prizes await – and it’s all for free!

Once registered for the Summer Reading Club, children will receive an exciting adventure map to begin challenges to complete three quests.

They will be able to collect prizes along the way as well as going into the draw to win a book voucher once all quests are completed.

It’s super easy to join:

Step 1. Register for the Summer Reading Club [online](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/Summer-Reading-Club)
&#x20;or at your local library.

Step 2. Pick up a copy of your adventure map from your library or download a copy from the [website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/Whats-On/For-Kids/Summer-Reading-Club)
.

Step 3. Complete three quests to receive rewards and an entry into a prize draw.

All Summer Reading Club entries close 5pm Tuesday January 31, 2023.

Winners will be announced Thursday, February 2, 2023.

For more information and to register head to the Library [website](https://library.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/)
