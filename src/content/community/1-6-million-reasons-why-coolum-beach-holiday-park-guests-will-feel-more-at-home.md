Campers and grey nomads are in for a treat and can prepare to experience the luxury of home comforts at Sunshine Coast Council’s Coolum Beach Holiday Park.

The beachside getaway will soon offer a sustainable and accessible coastal-style amenities block thanks to a $1.6 million investment.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 9 councillor Maria Suarez said the project was planned to be completed just in time for the winter school holidays.

“This premium coastal holiday park now offers campers a home-away-from-home with all the modern conveniences,” Cr Suarez said.

“Last month, (January 31) demolition works started on the old building, with the new building set to include amenities and showers for all campers, including those living with a disability, plus outdoor showers for those coming straight from the beach to the campsite and a laundry space to wash and dry.

“As Australia’s most sustainable region it was imperative the building was equipped with solar power generation, battery storage and rainwater harvesting for use in flushing toilets.

“The north facing roof is ideally positioned to maximise the capture of solar energy.   

“The materials, fittings and fixtures have been selected to withstand the coastal environment, achieve longevity and reduce maintenance costs.

“This upgrade will meet the demand for the ever-growing number of guests discovering this popular beachside getaway.

“Coolum is one of two council-owned, dog-friendly family [holiday parks](https://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
&#x20;on the Sunshine Coast – the other at Mudjimba which will also be undergoing a very similar amenities upgrade later this year.

“Coolum is a quintessential Sunshine Coast patrolled surf beach and like all of council’s holiday parks at Dicky Beach, Mooloolaba, Maroochydore, Cotton Tree and Mudjimba, is on prime beach frontage.

“The park is set on four hectares and is one of the region’s most popular camping and caravan destinations which is why council continues to invest in our facilities to ensure they remain contemporary and attractive for all our valued guests.”

Coolum Beach Holiday Park Manager Nicole Filippini said the new upgrade would be well received.

“Campers have been looking forward to the upgrade for a long time and are very excited to see what the new build will look like,” Mrs Filippini said.  

“Constant park improvements always add to a positive experience for the guests.

“As a result of the pandemic, the industry has grown in the last two years and the popularity of caravanning and camping around Australia is massive. 

“We are looking forward to having the building complete for all our winter guests to enjoy.”

Council operates six holiday parks in the Sunshine Coast area. Visit the [Sunshine Coast Holiday Parks](https://www.sunshinecoastholidayparks.com.au/)
