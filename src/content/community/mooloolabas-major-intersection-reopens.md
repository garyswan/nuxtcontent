Major roadworks for Stages 2 and 3 of the Mooloolaba Transport Corridor Upgrade (MTCU) are on the road to completion.

The community can now drive through the key intersection at the corner of Brisbane Road, Walan and Hancock streets after it reopened today (15 September 2022).

Intersection open as of Thursday 15 September 2022.

The reopening comes after extensive underground services works, including mains water, sewer, stormwater and telecommunications were undertaken at the intersection since late April.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 4 Councillor Joe Natoli said the extensive works would help to ‘future proof’ Mooloolaba.

Cr Natoli thanked residents, businesses and visitors for their continued patience and understanding while works took place.

“After a period of complex construction, we’re now meeting some major milestones including the July opening of two of the four lanes of the new [Mayes Canal bridge](https://oursc.com.au/featured/mooloolabas-new-mayes-canal-bridge-reaches-major-milestone)
&#x20;and now the main intersection flowing again,” Cr Natoli said.

“The construction blitz of Stages 2 and 3 is a key part of the planning, aimed at having major roadworks completed by the end of this year.

“Brisbane Road’s two lanes will be expanded to four to improve traffic flow, enhance the southern entrance into Mooloolaba, and create a corridor that is integrated and inviting for pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and public transport users.

“Next time you’re driving on the new intersection remember there’s more to it, than what meets the eye!

“Below the asphalt, large trenches were dug out during the night which made way for 345 metres of storm water pipes and 235 metres of water main pipes.

“In the next few months, the new Foote Street, Brisbane Road and Tarcoola Avenue signalised intersection will experience similar underground infrastructure works.

“To keep two-way traffic moving along Foote Street, the central island carparking, between Brisbane Road and Burnett Street will be temporarily removed for about two months.

“This will allow the construction team to use the island area as a temporary traffic lane and keep traffic feeding from Parkyn Parade, the Esplanade and River Esplanade.”

To make room for the signalised intersection upgrade, some parking spaces in this area will not be reinstated in the final design.

\*Stage 2 works are benefitting from a $12 million investment from the Australian Government.

Once completed the MTCU will accommodate anticipated growth in traffic generated by residents, businesses and Mooloolaba’s attractive natural features, with daily trips expected to increase from around 61,000 today to more than 90,000 in 2041.

Council will continue to make every effort to minimise impacts to the local community and businesses during construction and thanks the community for their patience during this major construction project.
