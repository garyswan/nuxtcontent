A little rain won’t dampen the spirits of the Landsborough and surrounds sporting community, after drainage works were completed to improve usability at Skippy Park.

Sunshine Coast Council Division 1 Councillor Rick Baberowski said the drainage upgrades have been completed just in time for our typically wet summer season.

“Come rain or hail the Skippy Park field will be much more resilient to wet weather which is a big win for sporting groups in Landsborough and surrounds,” Cr Baberowski said.

“There were ongoing concerns about the poor drainage at the site which was impacting usage of the very popular sports field.

“The field has undergone subsoil drainage to improve surface and move ground water away from the oval which was constructed by local contractors Complete Turf Management.

“This subsoil system is fed by a series of sand slits at 250mm spacing across the entire field. What this does is deal with surface water when it rains and reduces the ground water travelling through the site.”

The drainage swale on the southern boundary which was regularly boggy and restricting access to the field has been concrete lined, and a new crossover to the field from the club area has also been paved.  

“I’m pleased these improvements will have the Little As club and other sporting groups utilising the field all year round,” Cr Baberowski said.

“It’s a great example of what can be achieved through a strong partnership between the State Government and council.”

The project was funded with $185,703 from the Queensland Government’s Covid Works for Queensland Program in association with Sunshine Coast Council.
