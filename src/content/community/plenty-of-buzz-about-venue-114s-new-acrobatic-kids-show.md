This January school holidays join Queen Bee and Worker Bee on their family fun and environmental adventures in an unforgettable acrobatic show for all ages at Venue 114 on January 14.

*A Bee Story* is an Australian physical theatre show for children and families incorporating a kaleidoscope of circus, acrobatics, dance and live music. It tells the story of Queen Bee and Worker Bee who must work together to rebuild their hive after being destroyed by a bushfire.

Featuring many light-hearted and funny moments including Worker Bee's failed attempts to reach a very high flower, Queen Bee getting caught in a bee net and a few mishaps in the bee's attempts to find a new place to call home.

With influences from the 2019 Australian bushfires, and the increasing impact that climate change is having on the environment, *A Bee Story* focuses on Australia’s native bees and how crucial they are to a functioning and thriving ecosystem. Just like the bees in the story who must work together to rebuild their home, the story relays how the community must adjust and collaborate to combat climate change too.

*A Bee Story* has themes of environmentalism, sustainability and community spirit, and was directed by performer Robbie Curtis (Circa, Cirque du Soleil, Circus Oz, Australian Ballet), and co-created with musician and performer Lizzie McRae.

Venue 114, is proud to be presenting a production like *A Bee Story* that aligns with their commitment to sustainability. Venue 114 have been Earth Check Evaluated by the international organisation in both 2020 and 2021.
