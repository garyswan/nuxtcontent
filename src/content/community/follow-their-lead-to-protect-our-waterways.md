Take a look at these glamourous Litter Maids in Nambour during the 1970s.  

As our population continues to grow, their message to ‘Do The Right Thing’ rings truer than ever, especially as we try to stop litter from entering our waterways.  

Most of Council’s stormwater drains discharge directly to our waterways or beaches, so preventing litter and other pollutants from entering the stormwater network is really important.  

But, Council cannot do it alone and we need everyone in our community to help us effectively manage our stormwater.  

Some of our stormwater assets are equipped with gross pollutant traps and/or litter baskets. However, these devices are not suitable in all locations.  

So, if we can stop litter and other pollutants from entering the stormwater network in the first place, that’s the best way for us to protect our precious waterways and beaches.   

HAVE YOUR SAY  

To help ensure we have an integrated stormwater network that is effective, sustainable and contributes to waterway health, Council has developed the Draft Stormwater Management Strategy and is now seeking community feedback. The strategy aims to identify existing and future issues and outline ways they can be addressed. 

Visit [Council’s website](https://haveyoursay.sunshinecoast.qld.gov.au/stormwater-management-strategy-sms)
&#x20;to have your say by 5pm Friday 14 May.
