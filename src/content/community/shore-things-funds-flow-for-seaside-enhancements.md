Beautifying Ocean Street, Maroochydore, upgrades to North Shore Sports Complex and bringing the Marcoola Master Plan to life are among the Division 8 highlights in the Sunshine Coast Council 2023-24 Budget.

Division 8 Councillor Jason O’Pray said this was without doubt, the best budget he had seen for Division 8.

“I am so very chuffed, and I’m absolutely certain the community will agree. It’s amazing,’’ Cr O’Pray said.

“Our neighbourhoods will directly benefit from $5 million to make a number of improvements to pathways, parks and gardens across Coolum Beach, Marcoola, Maroochydore, Mount Coolum, Mudjimba, Pacific Paradise, Point Arkwright, Sunshine Cove, Twin Waters and Yaroomba.

“My focus this financial year is really around getting the little things right for my communities.

“I am so very pleased to see Mudjimba featured so prominently in Council’s budget again this year.

“Council will contribute $700,000 towards the North Shore Multi-Sports Complex Clubhouse, matching a $700,000 Queensland Government grant through the South-East Queensland Community Stimulus Program.

“An ‘entry statement’ for our beautiful beachside village of Mudjimba includes new signage and line marking identifying entry into the residential area to improve safety.

Also in Mudjimba, $323,000 will be spent improving Power Memorial Park barbeque shelters, a gate renewal, and to ensure our youngsters can play safely, new play equipment.

“Marcoola projects that have gained funding include continuation of upgrades to Keith Royal Oval Park amenities, Marcoola Beach Streetscaping and aspects of the Master Plan thanks to all the community feedback.

“A section of the Maroochy River revetment wall adjacent to Bradman Avenue will be demolished with removal of existing rock revetment wall, and installation of the new rock revetment wall.

“Without this important work, it is possible that severe erosion could occur, causing damage to the riverfront open space area along Bradman Avenue.

“This renewal will ensure the revetment wall continues to protect the Maroochy River’s precious riverfront infrastructure for years to come, providing an ongoing service of these valued adjacent facilities to the community.

“As one of our cultural destinations for food, dining and live music, Council will invest $550,000 in Ocean Street placemaking renewal.

“Sunshine Cove residents will be excited to see a new $45,000 kayak launch ramp installed to provide access to the estates stunning waterways.

“Council’s billion-dollar 2023-24 budget handed down on June 22 included a diverse and valuable mix of projects to create a stronger, better and more sustainable Sunshine Coast.”
